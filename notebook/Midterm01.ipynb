    "- Write a function to find where f(x) crosses zero using a bisection algorithm. The bisection algorithm works in the following way - given the left and right boundary, it checks if the crossing is between left and mid-point, or between the right and mid-point. If the former, the mid-point is set as the new right boundary and so on. In other words the interval containing the crossing is halved at each step. Stop when the length of the interval is less than 1e-6, and return the left and right boundaries at that point.\n",

blessings\\nof existence and had lived nearly twentyone years in the world\\nwith very little to distress or vex her\\n\\nshe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate\\nindulgent father and had in consequence of her sisters marriage\\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period  her mother\\nhad died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\\nremembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied\\nby an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short\\nof a mother in affection\\n\\nsixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouses family\\nless as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters\\nbut particularly of emma  between them it was more the intimacy\\nof sisters  even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\\noffice of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\\nher to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being\\nnow long passed away they had been living together as friend and\\nfriend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked\\nhighly esteeming miss taylors judgment but directed chiefly by\\nher own\\n\\nthe real evils indeed of emmas situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little\\ntoo well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened\\nalloy to her many enjoyments  the danger however was at present\\nso unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\\nwith her\\n\\nsorrow camea gentle sorrowbut not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousnessmiss taylor married  it was miss\\ntaylors loss which first brought grief  it was on the weddingday\\nof this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought\\nof any continuance  the wedding over and the bridepeople gone\\nher father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect\\nof a third to cheer a long evening  her father composed himself\\nto sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit\\nand think of what she had lost\\n\\nthe event had every promise of happiness for her friend  mr weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age\\nand pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what selfdenying generous friendship she had always wished\\nand promoted the match but it was a black mornings work for her\\nthe want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day\\nshe recalled her past kindnessthe kindness the affection of sixteen\\nyearshow she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears oldhow she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\\nher in healthand how nursed her through the various illnesses\\nof childhood  a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed isabellas marriage on their\\nbeing left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection\\nshe had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent\\nwellinformed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family\\ninterested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself\\nin every pleasure every scheme of hersone to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her\\nas could never find fault\\n\\nhow was she to bear the changeit was true that her friend was\\ngoing only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must\\nbe the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them\\nand a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages\\nnatural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering\\nfrom intellectual solitude  she dearly loved her father but he\\nwas no companion for her  he could not meet her in conversation\\nrational or playful\\n\\nthe evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had\\nnot married early was much increased by his constitution and habits\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity\\nof mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years\\nand though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\\nand his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him\\nat any time\\n\\nher sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony\\nbeing settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond\\nher daily reach and many a long october and november evening must\\nbe struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next\\nvisit from isabella and her husband and their little children\\nto fill the house and give her pleasant society again\\n\\nhighbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town\\nto which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies\\nand name did really belong afforded her no equals  the woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there  all looked up to them  she had\\nmany acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil\\nbut not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss\\ntaylor for even half a day  it was a melancholy change and emma\\ncould not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things\\ntill her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful\\nhis spirits required support  he was a nervous man easily depressed\\nfond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them\\nhating change of every kind  matrimony as the origin of change\\nwas always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled\\nto his own daughters marrying nor could ever speak of her but\\nwith compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from\\nhis habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to\\nsuppose that other people could feel differently from himself\\nhe was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad\\na thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal\\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield\\nemma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him\\nfrom such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner\\n\\npoor miss taylori wish she were here again  what a pity it\\nis that mr weston ever thought of her\\n\\ni cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot  mr weston is such\\na goodhumoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves\\na good wifeand you would not have had miss taylor live with us\\nfor ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own\\n\\na house of her ownbut where is the advantage of a house of her own\\nthis is three times as largeand you have never any odd humours\\nmy dear\\n\\nhow often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see\\nuswe shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay\\nwedding visit very soon\\n\\nmy dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance\\ni could not walk half so far\\n\\nno papa nobody thought of your walking  we must go in the carriage\\nto be sure\\n\\nthe carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for\\nsuch a little wayand where are the poor horses to be while we\\nare paying our visit\\n\\nthey are to be put into mr westons stable papa  you know we\\nhave settled all that already  we talked it all over with mr weston\\nlast night  and as for james you may be very sure he will always like\\ngoing to randalls because of his daughters being housemaid there\\ni only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else  that was\\nyour doing papa  you got hannah that good place  nobody thought\\nof hannah till you mentioned herjames is so obliged to you\\n\\ni am very glad i did think of her  it was very lucky for i would\\nnot have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account\\nand i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil\\nprettyspoken girl i have a great opinion of her  whenever i see her\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner\\nand when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she\\nalways turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it\\ni am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great\\ncomfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is\\nused to see  whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know\\nshe will be hearing of us  he will be able to tell her how we\\nall are\\n\\nemma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas\\nand hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own\\nthe backgammontable was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary\\n\\nmr knightley a sensible man about seven or eightandthirty was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly\\nconnected with it as the elder brother of isabellas husband\\nhe lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor\\nand always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual\\nas coming directly from their mutual connexions in london  he had\\nreturned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked\\nup to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square\\nit was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time\\nmr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good\\nand his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were\\nanswered most satisfactorily  when this was over mr woodhouse\\ngratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come\\nout at this late hour to call upon us  i am afraid you must have\\nhad a shocking walk\\n\\nnot at all sir  it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild\\nthat i must draw back from your great fire\\n\\nbut you must have found it very damp and dirty  i wish you may\\nnot catch cold\\n\\ndirty sir look at my shoes  not a speck on them\\n\\nwell that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal\\nof rain here  it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\\nwhile we were at breakfast  i wanted them to put off the wedding\\n\\nby the byei have not wished you joy  being pretty well aware\\nof what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry\\nwith my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well\\nhow did you all behave who cried most\\n\\nah poor miss taylor tis a sad business\\n\\npoor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly\\nsay poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma\\nbut when it comes to the question of dependence or independenceat\\nany rate it must be better to have only one to please than two\\n\\nespecially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature\\nsaid emma playfully  that is what you have in your head\\ni knowand what you would certainly say if my father were not by\\n\\ni believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse\\nwith a sigh  i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome\\n\\nmy dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose\\nmr knightley to mean you  what a horrible idea oh no i meant\\nonly myself  mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know\\nin a jokeit is all a joke  we always say what we like to one another\\n\\nmr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see\\nfaults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them\\nand though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself\\nshe knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would\\nnot have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being\\nthought perfect by every body\\n\\nemma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i\\nmeant no reflection on any body  miss taylor has been used\\nto have two persons to please she will now have but one\\nthe chances are that she must be a gainer\\n\\nwell said emma willing to let it passyou want to hear\\nabout the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all\\nbehaved charmingly  every body was punctual every body in their\\nbest looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen  oh no\\nwe all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart\\nand were sure of meeting every day\\n\\ndear emma bears every thing so well said her father\\nbut mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor\\nand i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for\\n\\nemma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles\\nit is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion\\nsaid mr knightley  we should not like her so well as we do sir\\nif we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to\\nmiss taylors advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be\\nat miss taylors time of life to be settled in a home of her own\\nand how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision\\nand therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure\\nevery friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily\\nmarried\\n\\nand you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma\\nand a very considerable onethat i made the match myself\\ni made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place\\nand be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would\\nnever marry again may comfort me for any thing\\n\\nmr knightley shook his head at her  her father fondly replied\\nah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things\\nfor whatever you say always comes to pass  pray do not make any\\nmore matches\\n\\ni promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed\\nfor other people  it is the greatest amusement in the world and\\nafter such success you knowevery body said that mr weston would\\nnever marry again  oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower\\nso long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife\\nso constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his\\nfriends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful\\nmr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did\\nnot like it  oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again\\nsome people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed\\nand others of the son and the uncle not letting him  all manner\\nof solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none\\nof it\\n\\never since the dayabout four years agothat miss taylor and i\\nmet with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle\\nhe darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas\\nfor us from farmer mitchells i made up my mind on the subject\\ni planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed\\nme in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave\\noff matchmaking\\n\\ni do not understand what you mean by success said mr knightley\\nsuccess supposes endeavour  your time has been properly and\\ndelicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four\\nyears to bring about this marriage  a worthy employment for a young\\nladys mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match\\nas you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself\\none idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor\\nif mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself\\nevery now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where\\nis your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess\\nand that is all that can be said\\n\\nand have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess\\ni pity youi thought you clevererfor depend upon it a lucky\\nguess is never merely luck  there is always some talent in it\\nand as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not\\nknow that i am so entirely without any claim to it  you have drawn\\ntwo pretty pictures but i think there may be a thirda something\\nbetween the donothing and the doall if i had not promoted mr westons\\nvisits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed\\nmany little matters it might not have come to any thing after all\\ni think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that\\n\\na straightforward openhearted man like weston and a rational\\nunaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their\\nown concerns  you are more likely to have done harm to yourself\\nthan good to them by interference\\n\\nemma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others\\nrejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part  but my dear\\npray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up\\nones family circle grievously\\n\\nonly one more papa only for mr elton  poor mr elton you\\nlike mr elton papai must look about for a wife for him\\nthere is nobody in highbury who deserves himand he has been\\nhere a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably\\nthat it would be a shame to have him single any longerand i thought\\nwhen he was joining their hands today he looked so very much as if\\nhe would like to have the same kind office done for him i think\\nvery well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing\\nhim a service\\n\\nmr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very\\ngood young man and i have a great regard for him  but if you\\nwant to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come\\nand dine with us some day  that will be a much better thing\\ni dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him\\n\\nwith a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr knightley\\nlaughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much\\nbetter thing  invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best\\nof the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife\\ndepend upon it a man of six or sevenandtwenty can take care\\nof himself\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii\\n\\n\\nmr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\ngentility and property  he had received a good education but\\non succeeding early in life to a small independence had become\\nindisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers\\nwere engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social\\ntemper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied\\n\\ncaptain weston was a general favourite and when the chances\\nof his military life had introduced him to miss churchill\\nof a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love\\nwith him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife\\nwho had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance\\nwhich the connexion would offend\\n\\nmiss churchill however being of age and with the full command\\nof her fortunethough her fortune bore no proportion to the\\nfamilyestatewas not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it\\ntook place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill\\nwho threw her off with due decorum  it was an unsuitable connexion\\nand did not produce much happiness  mrs weston ought to have found\\nmore in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\\nmade him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\\nof being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit\\nshe had not the best  she had resolution enough to pursue\\nher own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain\\nfrom unreasonable regrets at that brothers unreasonable anger\\nnor from missing the luxuries of her former home  they lived beyond\\ntheir income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe\\nshe did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once\\nto be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe\\n\\ncaptain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills\\nas making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst\\nof the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage\\nhe was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain\\nfrom the expense of the child however he was soon relieved\\nthe boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering\\nillness of his mothers been the means of a sort of reconciliation\\nand mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own\\nnor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to\\ntake the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease\\nsome scruples and some reluctance the widowerfather may be supposed\\nto have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations\\nthe child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills\\nand he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to\\nimprove as he could\\n\\na complete change of life became desirable  he quitted the militia\\nand engaged in trade having brothers already established in a\\ngood way in london which afforded him a favourable opening\\nit was a concern which brought just employment enough  he had still\\na small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent\\nand between useful occupation and the pleasures of society\\nthe next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away\\nhe had by that time realised an easy competenceenough to secure\\nthe purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had\\nalways longed forenough to marry a woman as portionless even\\nas miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own\\nfriendly and social disposition\\n\\nit was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence\\nhis schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\\non youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling\\ntill he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long\\nlooked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects\\nin view till they were accomplished  he had made his fortune\\nbought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new\\nperiod of existence with every probability of greater happiness\\nthan in any yet passed through  he had never been an unhappy man\\nhis own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage\\nbut his second must shew him how delightful a welljudging and truly\\namiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof\\nof its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen\\nto excite gratitude than to feel it\\n\\nhe had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was\\nhis own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought\\nup as his uncles heir it had become so avowed an adoption\\nas to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age\\nit was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his\\nfathers assistance  his father had no apprehension of it\\nthe aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely\\nbut it was not in mr westons nature to imagine that any caprice\\ncould be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed\\nso deservedly dear  he saw his son every year in london\\nand was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine\\nyoung man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too\\nhe was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his\\nmerits and prospects a kind of common concern\\n\\nmr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life  his coming\\nto visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved\\n\\nnow upon his fathers marriage it was very generally proposed\\nas a most proper attention that the visit should take place\\nthere was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when\\nmrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and\\nmiss bates returned the visit  now was the time for mr frank\\nchurchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was\\nunderstood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion\\nfor a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention\\nof the handsome letter mrs weston had received  i suppose you\\nhave heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written\\nto mrs weston i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed\\nmr woodhouse told me of it  mr woodhouse saw the letter and he\\nsays he never saw such a handsome letter in his life\\n\\nit was indeed a highly prized letter  mrs weston had of course\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense\\nand a most welcome addition to every source and every expression\\nof congratulation which her marriage had already secured  she felt\\nherself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough\\nto know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only\\nregret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship\\nfor her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her\\n\\nshe knew that at times she must be missed and could not think\\nwithout pain of emmas losing a single pleasure or suffering\\nan hours ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear\\nemma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation\\nthan most girls would have been and had sense and energy\\nand spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily\\nthrough its little difficulties and privations  and then there was\\nsuch comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield\\nso convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr westons\\ndisposition and circumstances which would make the approaching\\nseason no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the\\nweek together\\n\\nher situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude\\nto mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her\\nsatisfactionher more than satisfactionher cheerful enjoyment\\nwas so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father\\nwas sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity\\npoor miss taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre\\nof every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening\\nattended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own\\nbut never did she go without mr woodhouses giving a gentle sigh\\nand saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay\\n\\nthere was no recovering miss taylornor much likelihood of\\nceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation\\nto mr woodhouse  the compliments of his neighbours were over\\nhe was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event\\nand the weddingcake which had been a great distress to him\\nwas all eat up  his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he\\ncould never believe other people to be different from himself\\nwhat was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body\\nand he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having\\nany weddingcake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly\\ntried to prevent any bodys eating it  he had been at the pains\\nof consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject  mr perry\\nwas an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one\\nof the comforts of mr woodhouses life and upon being applied to\\nhe could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the\\nbias of inclination that weddingcake might certainly disagree\\nwith manyperhaps with most people unless taken moderately\\nwith such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped\\nto influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the\\ncake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till\\nit was all gone\\n\\nthere was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys\\nbeing seen with a slice of mrs westons weddingcake in their\\nhands but mr woodhouse would never believe it\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii\\n\\n\\nmr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way  he liked very much\\nto have his friends come and see him and from various united causes\\nfrom his long residence at hartfield and his good nature\\nfrom his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the\\nvisits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked\\nhe had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle\\nhis horror of late hours and large dinnerparties made him unfit\\nfor any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms\\nfortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish\\nand donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley\\ncomprehended many such  not unfrequently through emmas persuasion\\nhe had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening\\nparties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any\\ntime unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week\\nin which emma could not make up a cardtable for him\\n\\nreal longstanding regard brought the westons and mr knightley\\nand by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it\\nthe privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude\\nfor the elegancies and society of mr woodhouses drawingroom\\nand the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being\\nthrown away\\n\\nafter these came a second set among the most comeatable\\nof whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies\\nalmost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield\\nand who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse\\nthought it no hardship for either james or the horses  had it\\ntaken place only once a year it would have been a grievance\\n\\nmrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a\\nvery old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille\\nshe lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was\\nconsidered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady\\nunder such untoward circumstances can excite  her daughter enjoyed\\na most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young\\nhandsome rich nor married  miss bates stood in the very worst\\npredicament in the world for having much of the public favour\\nand she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself\\nor frighten those who might hate her into outward respect\\nshe had never boasted either beauty or cleverness  her youth\\nhad passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted\\nto the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small\\nincome go as far as possible  and yet she was a happy woman\\nand a woman whom no one named without goodwill  it was her own\\nuniversal goodwill and contented temper which worked such wonders\\nshe loved every body was interested in every bodys happiness\\nquicksighted to every bodys merits thought herself a most fortunate\\ncreature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother\\nand so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted\\nfor nothing  the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature\\nher contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body\\nand a mine of felicity to herself  she was a great talker upon\\nlittle matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial\\ncommunications and harmless gossip\\n\\nmrs goddard was the mistress of a schoolnot of a seminary\\nor an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of\\nrefined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality\\nupon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for\\nenormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanitybut\\na real honest oldfashioned boardingschool where a reasonable\\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price\\nand where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble\\nthemselves into a little education without any danger of coming\\nback prodigies  mrs goddards school was in high reputeand\\nvery deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy\\nspot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty\\nof wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer\\nand in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands\\nit was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\\nafter her to church  she was a plain motherly kind of woman\\nwho had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled\\nto the occasional holiday of a teavisit and having formerly\\nowed much to mr woodhouses kindness felt his particular claim\\non her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancywork\\nwhenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside\\n\\nthese were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently\\nable to collect and happy was she for her fathers sake\\nin the power though as far as she was herself concerned\\nit was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston  she was delighted\\nto see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with\\nherself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings\\nof three such women made her feel that every evening so spent\\nwas indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated\\n\\nas she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close\\nof the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting\\nin most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her\\na most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen\\nwhom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in\\non account of her beauty  a very gracious invitation was returned\\nand the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion\\n\\nharriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody  somebody had\\nplaced her several years back at mrs goddards school\\nand somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar\\nto that of parlourboarder this was all that was generally known\\nof her history  she had no visible friends but what had been\\nacquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit\\nin the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her\\n\\nshe was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\nwhich emma particularly admired  she was short plump and fair\\nwith a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features\\nand a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening\\nemma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite\\ndetermined to continue the acquaintance\\n\\nshe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smiths\\nconversation but she found her altogether very engagingnot\\ninconveniently shy not unwilling to talkand yet so far from pushing\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly\\ngrateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly\\nimpressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style\\nto what she had been used to that she must have good sense\\nand deserve encouragement  encouragement should be given\\nthose soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be\\nwasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions\\nthe acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her\\nthe friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort\\nof people must be doing her harm  they were a family of the name\\nof martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm\\nof mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwellvery creditably\\nshe believedshe knew mr knightley thought highly of thembut they\\nmust be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates\\nof a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\\nto be quite perfect  she would notice her she would improve her\\nshe would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her\\ninto good society she would form her opinions and her manners\\nit would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking\\nhighly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers\\n\\nshe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking\\nand listening and forming all these schemes in the inbetweens that\\nthe evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the suppertable\\nwhich always closed such parties and for which she had been\\nused to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready\\nand moved forwards to the fire before she was aware  with an\\nalacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never\\nindifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively\\nwith the real goodwill of a mind delighted with its own ideas\\ndid she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend\\nthe minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she\\nknew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests\\n\\nupon such occasions poor mr woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare\\nhe loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion\\nof his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome\\nmade him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his\\nhospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing\\nhis care for their health made him grieve that they would eat\\n\\nsuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that\\nhe could with thorough selfapprobation recommend though he\\nmight constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing\\nthe nicer things to say\\n\\nmrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs\\nan egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome  serle understands boiling\\nan egg better than any body  i would not recommend an egg boiled\\nby any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small\\nyou seeone of our small eggs will not hurt you  miss bates\\nlet emma help you to a little bit of tarta very little bit\\nours are all appletarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome\\npreserves here  i do not advise the custard  mrs goddard what say\\nyou to half a glass of wine a small halfglass put into a tumbler\\nof water i do not think it could disagree with you\\n\\nemma allowed her father to talkbut supplied her visitors in\\na much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had\\nparticular pleasure in sending them away happy  the happiness\\nof miss smith was quite equal to her intentions  miss woodhouse\\nwas so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the\\nintroduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble\\ngrateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings\\ndelighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated\\nher all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv\\n\\n\\nharriet smiths intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing\\nquick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging\\nand telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased\\nso did their satisfaction in each other  as a walking companion\\nemma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her\\nin that respect mrs westons loss had been important  her father\\nnever went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground\\nsufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied\\nand since mrs westons marriage her exercise had been too much confined\\nshe had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant\\nand a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any\\ntime to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges\\nbut in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her\\nand was confirmed in all her kind designs\\n\\nharriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile\\ngrateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring\\nto be guided by any one she looked up to  her early attachment\\nto herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company\\nand power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that\\nthere was no want of taste though strength of understanding must\\nnot be expected  altogether she was quite convinced of harriet\\nsmiths being exactly the young friend she wantedexactly the\\nsomething which her home required  such a friend as mrs weston\\nwas out of the question  two such could never be granted\\ntwo such she did not want  it was quite a different sort of thing\\na sentiment distinct and independent  mrs weston was the object\\nof a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem\\nharriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful\\nfor mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing\\n\\nher first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\\nwere the parents but harriet could not tell  she was ready to tell\\nevery thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain\\nemma was obliged to fancy what she likedbut she could never\\nbelieve that in the same situation she should not have discovered\\nthe truth  harriet had no penetration  she had been satisfied\\nto hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her\\nand looked no farther\\n\\nmrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the\\nschool in general formed naturally a great part of the conversationand\\nbut for her acquaintance with the martins of abbeymill farm\\nit must have been the whole  but the martins occupied her thoughts\\na good deal she had spent two very happy months with them\\nand now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place  emma encouraged her\\ntalkativenessamused by such a picture of another set of beings\\nand enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\nexultation of mrs martins having two parlours two very good parlours\\nindeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddards drawingroom\\nand of her having an upper maid who had lived fiveandtwenty years\\nwith her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys\\nand one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed\\nand of mrs martins saying as she was so fond of it it should be\\ncalled her cow and of their having a very handsome summerhouse\\nin their garden where some day next year they were all to drink\\nteaa very handsome summerhouse large enough to hold a dozen people\\n\\nfor some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause\\nbut as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose\\nshe had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter\\na son and sons wife who all lived together but when it appeared\\nthat the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always\\nmentioned with approbation for his great goodnature in doing something\\nor other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin\\nno wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she\\nwere not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever\\n\\nwith this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number\\nand meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it  harriet was very ready\\nto speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\\nevening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very goodhumoured\\nand obliging  he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring\\nher some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them\\nand in every thing else he was so very obliging  he had his\\nshepherds son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her\\nshe was very fond of singing  he could sing a little himself\\nshe believed he was very clever and understood every thing\\nhe had a very fine flock and while she was with them\\nhe had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country\\nshe believed every body spoke well of him  his mother and sisters\\nwere very fond of him  mrs martin had told her one day and there\\nwas a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body\\nto be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married\\nhe would make a good husband  not that she wanted him to marry\\nshe was in no hurry at all\\n\\nwell done mrs martin thought emma  you know what you are about\\n\\nand when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send\\nmrs goddard a beautiful goosethe finest goose mrs goddard had\\never seen  mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all\\nthe three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson\\nto sup with her\\n\\nmr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line\\nof his own business he does not read\\n\\noh yesthat is noi do not knowbut i believe he has\\nread a good dealbut not what you would think any thing of\\nhe reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay\\nin one of the window seatsbut he reads all them to himself\\nbut sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read\\nsomething aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining\\nand i know he has read the vicar of wakefield  he never read the\\nromance of the forest nor the children of the abbey  he had never\\nheard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined\\nto get them now as soon as ever he can\\n\\nthe next question was\\n\\nwhat sort of looking man is mr martin\\n\\noh not handsomenot at all handsome  i thought him very plain\\nat first but i do not think him so plain now  one does not you know\\nafter a time  but did you never see him he is in highbury every\\nnow and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way\\nto kingston  he has passed you very often\\n\\nthat may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without\\nhaving any idea of his name  a young farmer whether on horseback\\nor on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity\\nthe yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i\\ncan have nothing to do  a degree or two lower and a creditable\\nappearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their\\nfamilies in some way or other  but a farmer can need none of my help\\nand is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every\\nother he is below it\\n\\nto be sure  oh yes it is not likely you should ever have\\nobserved him but he knows you very well indeedi mean by sight\\n\\ni have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man\\ni know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well\\nwhat do you imagine his age to be\\n\\nhe was fourandtwenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is\\nthe 23rd just a fortnight and a days differencewhich is very odd\\n\\nonly fourandtwenty that is too young to settle  his mother is\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry  they seem very comfortable\\nas they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him\\nshe would probably repent it  six years hence if he could meet\\nwith a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own\\nwith a little money it might be very desirable\\n\\nsix years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old\\n\\nwell and that is as early as most men can afford to marry\\nwho are not born to an independence  mr martin i imagine\\nhas his fortune entirely to makecannot be at all beforehand with\\nthe world  whatever money he might come into when his father died\\nwhatever his share of the family property it is i dare say\\nall afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though\\nwith diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to\\nimpossible that he should have realised any thing yet\\n\\nto be sure so it is  but they live very comfortably\\nthey have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing\\nand mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year\\n\\ni wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does\\nmarryi mean as to being acquainted with his wifefor though\\nhis sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether\\nobjected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit\\nfor you to notice  the misfortune of your birth ought to make you\\nparticularly careful as to your associates  there can be no doubt\\nof your being a gentlemans daughter and you must support your\\nclaim to that station by every thing within your own power or there\\nwill be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you\\n\\nyes to be sure i suppose there are  but while i visit\\nat hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse\\ni am not afraid of what any body can do\\n\\nyou understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i\\nwould have you so firmly established in good society as to be\\nindependent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse  i want to see you\\npermanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable\\nto have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say\\nthat if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries\\ni wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters\\nto be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere\\nfarmers daughter without education\\n\\nto be sure  yes  not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body\\nbut what had had some educationand been very well brought up\\nhowever i do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand i\\nam sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife  i shall\\nalways have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth\\nand should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well\\neducated as me  but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman\\ncertainly i had better not visit her if i can help it\\n\\nemma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech\\nand saw no alarming symptoms of love  the young man had been\\nthe first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold\\nand that there would be no serious difficulty on harriets side\\nto oppose any friendly arrangement of her own\\n\\nthey met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the\\ndonwell road  he was on foot and after looking very respectfully\\nat her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion\\nemma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey\\nand walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made\\nher quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin\\nhis appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man\\nbut his person had no other advantage and when he came to be\\ncontrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground\\nhe had gained in harriets inclination  harriet was not insensible\\nof manner she had voluntarily noticed her fathers gentleness\\nwith admiration as well as wonder  mr martin looked as if he\\ndid not know what manner was\\n\\nthey remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must\\nnot be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a\\nsmiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse\\nhoped very soon to compose\\n\\nonly think of our happening to meet himhow very odd it was\\nquite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls\\nhe did not think we ever walked this road  he thought we walked\\ntowards randalls most days  he has not been able to get the\\nromance of the forest yet  he was so busy the last time he was\\nat kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again tomorrow\\nso very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he\\nlike what you expected what do you think of him do you think him\\nso very plain\\n\\nhe is very plain undoubtedlyremarkably plainbut that is\\nnothing compared with his entire want of gentility  i had no\\nright to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no\\nidea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air\\ni had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility\\n\\nto be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not\\nso genteel as real gentlemen\\n\\ni think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen\\nthat you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin\\nat hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated\\nwell bred men  i should be surprized if after seeing them\\nyou could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving\\nhim to be a very inferior creatureand rather wondering at\\nyourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before\\ndo not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure\\nyou must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner\\nand the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated\\nas i stood here\\n\\ncertainly he is not like mr knightley  he has not such a fine\\nair and way of walking as mr knightley  i see the difference\\nplain enough  but mr knightley is so very fine a man\\n\\nmr knightleys air is so remarkably good that it is not fair\\nto compare mr martin with him  you might not see one in a hundred\\nwith gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley  but he is\\nnot the only gentleman you have been lately used to  what say you\\nto mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them\\ncompare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking\\nof being silent  you must see the difference\\n\\noh yesthere is a great difference  but mr weston is almost\\nan old man  mr weston must be between forty and fifty\\n\\nwhich makes his good manners the more valuable  the older a\\nperson grows harriet the more important it is that their manners\\nshould not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness\\nor coarseness or awkwardness becomes  what is passable in youth\\nis detestable in later age  mr martin is now awkward and abrupt\\nwhat will he be at mr westons time of life\\n\\nthere is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly\\n\\nbut there may be pretty good guessing  he will be a completely gross\\nvulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking\\nof nothing but profit and loss\\n\\nwill he indeed that will be very bad\\n\\nhow much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended\\nhe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\nelsewhich is just as it should be for a thriving man  what has\\nhe to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive\\nand be a very rich man in timeand his being illiterate and coarse\\nneed not disturb us\\n\\ni wonder he did not remember the bookwas all harriets answer\\nand spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might\\nbe safely left to itself  she therefore said no more for some time\\nher next beginning was\\n\\nin one respect perhaps mr eltons manners are superior\\nto mr knightleys or mr westons they have more gentleness\\nthey might be more safely held up as a pattern  there is an openness\\na quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body\\nlikes in him because there is so much goodhumour with itbut\\nthat would not do to be copied  neither would mr knightleys\\ndownright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits\\nhim very well his figure and look and situation in life seem\\nto allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him\\nhe would not be sufferable  on the contrary i think a young man\\nmight be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model\\nmr elton is goodhumoured cheerful obliging and gentle\\nhe seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late  i do not\\nknow whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either\\nof us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his\\nmanners are softer than they used to be  if he means any thing\\nit must be to please you  did not i tell you what he said of you\\nthe other day\\n\\nshe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn\\nfrom mr elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed\\nand smiled and said she had always thought mr elton very agreeable\\n\\nmr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving\\nthe young farmer out of harriets head  she thought it would\\nbe an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural\\nand probable for her to have much merit in planning it\\nshe feared it was what every body else must think of and predict\\nit was not likely however that any body should have equalled\\nher in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during\\nthe very first evening of harriets coming to hartfield  the longer\\nshe considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency\\nmr eltons situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself\\nand without low connexions at the same time not of any family\\nthat could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet  he had a\\ncomfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income\\nfor though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known\\nto have some independent property and she thought very highly\\nof him as a goodhumoured wellmeaning respectable young man\\nwithout any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world\\n\\nshe had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful\\ngirl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield\\nwas foundation enough on his side and on harriets there could be\\nlittle doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all\\nthe usual weight and efficacy  and he was really a very pleasing\\nyoung man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like\\nhe was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general\\nthough not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which\\nshe could not dispense withbut the girl who could be gratified\\nby a robert martins riding about the country to get walnuts\\nfor her might very well be conquered by mr eltons admiration\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v\\n\\n\\ni do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston said mr knightley of\\nthis great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing\\n\\na bad thing do you really think it a bad thingwhy so\\n\\ni think they will neither of them do the other any good\\n\\nyou surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her\\nwith a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good\\ni have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure\\nhow very differently we feelnot think they will do each other any\\ngood this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels\\nabout emma mr knightley\\n\\nperhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you\\nknowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle\\n\\nmr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here\\nfor he thinks exactly as i do on the subject  we were speaking\\nof it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma\\nthat there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with\\nmr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case\\nyou are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value\\nof a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort\\na woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used\\nto it all her life  i can imagine your objection to harriet smith\\nshe is not the superior young woman which emmas friend ought to be\\nbut on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed\\nit will be an inducement to her to read more herself  they will\\nread together  she means it i know\\n\\nemma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve\\nyears old  i have seen a great many lists of her drawingup at\\nvarious times of books that she meant to read regularly throughand\\nvery good lists they werevery well chosen and very neatly\\narrangedsometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule\\nthe list she drew up when only fourteeni remember thinking it\\ndid her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time\\nand i dare say she may have made out a very good list now  but i\\nhave done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma\\nshe will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience\\nand a subjection of the fancy to the understanding  where miss taylor\\nfailed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do\\nnothingyou never could persuade her to read half so much as you\\nwishedyou know you could not\\n\\ni dare say replied mrs weston smiling that i thought\\nso thenbut since we have parted i can never remember emmas\\nomitting to do any thing i wished\\n\\nthere is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as thatsaid\\nmr knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done  but i\\nhe soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses\\nmust still see hear and remember  emma is spoiled by being the\\ncleverest of her family  at ten years old she had the misfortune of\\nbeing able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen\\nshe was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident\\nand ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house\\nand of you all  in her mother she lost the only person able to cope\\nwith her  she inherits her mothers talents and must have been\\nunder subjection to her\\n\\ni should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on\\nyour recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouses family and wanted\\nanother situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for\\nme to any body  i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held\\n\\nyes said he smiling  you are better placed here very fit\\nfor a wife but not at all for a governess  but you were preparing\\nyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield\\nyou might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would\\nseem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her\\non the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will\\nand doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend\\nhim a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor\\n\\nthank you  there will be very little merit in making a good wife\\nto such a man as mr weston\\n\\nwhy to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away\\nand that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing\\nto be borne  we will not despair however  weston may grow cross\\nfrom the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him\\n\\ni hope not thatit is not likely  no mr knightley do not\\nforetell vexation from that quarter\\n\\nnot i indeed  i only name possibilities  i do not pretend to emmas\\ngenius for foretelling and guessing  i hope with all my heart\\nthe young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortunebut\\nharriet smithi have not half done about harriet smith  i think\\nher the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have\\nshe knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing\\nshe is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse\\nbecause undesigned  her ignorance is hourly flattery  how can\\nemma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet\\nis presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet\\ni will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance\\nhartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places\\nshe belongs to  she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable\\nwith those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home\\ni am much mistaken if emmas doctrines give any strength of mind\\nor tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties\\nof her situation in lifethey only give a little polish\\n\\ni either depend more upon emmas good sense than you do or am more\\nanxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance\\nhow well she looked last night\\n\\noh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you\\nvery well i shall not attempt to deny emmas being pretty\\n\\npretty say beautiful rather  can you imagine any thing nearer\\nperfect beauty than emma altogetherface and figure\\n\\ni do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have\\nseldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers\\nbut i am a partial old friend\\n\\nsuch an eyethe true hazle eyeand so brilliant regular features\\nopen countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health\\nand such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure\\nthere is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head\\nher glance  one hears sometimes of a child being the picture\\nof health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete\\npicture of grownup health  she is loveliness itself  mr knightley\\nis not she\\n\\ni have not a fault to find with her person he replied\\ni think her all you describe  i love to look at her and i\\nwill add this praise that i do not think her personally vain\\nconsidering how very handsome she is she appears to be little\\noccupied with it her vanity lies another way  mrs weston i am\\nnot to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread\\nof its doing them both harm\\n\\nand i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its\\nnot doing them any harm  with all dear emmas little faults\\nshe is an excellent creature  where shall we see a better daughter\\nor a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities\\nwhich may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong\\nshe will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the\\nright a hundred times\\n\\nvery well i will not plague you any more  emma shall be an angel\\nand i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john\\nand isabella  john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore\\nnot a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does\\nexcept when he is not quite frightened enough about the children\\ni am sure of having their opinions with me\\n\\ni know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind\\nbut excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself\\nyou know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emmas\\nmother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think\\nany possible good can arise from harriet smiths intimacy being made\\na matter of much discussion among you  pray excuse me but supposing\\nany little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy\\nit cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father\\nwho perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it\\nso long as it is a source of pleasure to herself  it has been so\\nmany years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized\\nmr knightley at this little remains of office\\n\\nnot at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it\\nit is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your\\nadvice has often found for it shall be attended to\\n\\nmrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy\\nabout her sister\\n\\nbe satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry  i will keep\\nmy illhumour to myself  i have a very sincere interest in emma\\nisabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a\\ngreater interest perhaps hardly so great  there is an anxiety\\na curiosity in what one feels for emma  i wonder what will become\\nof her\\n\\nso do i said mrs weston gently very much\\n\\nshe always declares she will never marry which of course\\nmeans just nothing at all  but i have no idea that she has yet\\never seen a man she cared for  it would not be a bad thing for her\\nto be very much in love with a proper object  i should like to see\\nemma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good\\nbut there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom\\nfrom home\\n\\nthere does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break\\nher resolution at present said mrs weston as can well be\\nand while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be\\nforming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties\\non poor mr woodhouses account  i do not recommend matrimony\\nat present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you\\n\\npart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of\\nher own and mr westons on the subject as much as possible\\nthere were wishes at randalls respecting emmas destiny but it\\nwas not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition\\nwhich mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston\\nthink of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he\\nhad nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi\\n\\n\\nemma could not feel a doubt of having given harriets fancy\\na proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity\\nto a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible\\nthan before of mr eltons being a remarkably handsome man with most\\nagreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up\\nthe assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon\\npretty confident of creating as much liking on harriets side\\nas there could be any occasion for  she was quite convinced\\nof mr eltons being in the fairest way of falling in love\\nif not in love already  she had no scruple with regard to him\\nhe talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could\\nnot suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add\\nhis perception of the striking improvement of harriets manner\\nsince her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least\\nagreeable proofs of his growing attachment\\n\\nyou have given miss smith all that she required said he\\nyou have made her graceful and easy  she was a beautiful creature\\nwhen she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have\\nadded are infinitely superior to what she received from nature\\n\\ni am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet\\nonly wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints\\nshe had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness\\nin herself  i have done very little\\n\\nif it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant\\nmr elton\\n\\ni have perhaps given her a little more decision of character\\nhave taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her\\nway before\\n\\nexactly so that is what principally strikes me  so much superadded\\ndecision of character skilful has been the hand\\n\\ngreat has been the pleasure i am sure  i never met with\\na disposition more truly amiable\\n\\ni have no doubt of it and it was spoken with a sort\\nof sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover\\nshe was not less pleased another day with the manner\\nin which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriets picture\\n\\ndid you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did\\nyou ever sit for your picture\\n\\nharriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say\\nwith a very interesting naivete\\n\\noh dear no never\\n\\nno sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed\\n\\nwhat an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would\\ngive any money for it  i almost long to attempt her likeness myself\\nyou do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had\\na great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of\\nmy friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general\\nbut from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust\\nbut really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me\\nit would be such a delight to have her picture\\n\\nlet me entreat you cried mr elton it would indeed be a delight\\nlet me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a\\ntalent in favour of your friend  i know what your drawings are\\nhow could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in\\nspecimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston\\nsome inimitable figurepieces in her drawingroom at randalls\\n\\nyes good manthought emmabut what has all that to do with taking\\nlikenesses you know nothing of drawing  dont pretend to be\\nin raptures about mine  keep your raptures for harriets face\\nwell if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe\\ni shall try what i can do  harriets features are very delicate\\nwhich makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity\\nin the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought\\nto catch\\n\\nexactly sothe shape of the eye and the lines about the mouthi\\nhave not a doubt of your success  pray pray attempt it\\nas you will do it it will indeed to use your own words\\nbe an exquisite possession\\n\\nbut i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit\\nshe thinks so little of her own beauty  did not you observe her\\nmanner of answering me how completely it meant why should my\\npicture be drawn\\n\\noh yes i observed it i assure you  it was not lost on me\\nbut still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded\\n\\nharriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest\\npressing of both the others  emma wished to go to work directly\\nand therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts\\nat portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they\\nmight decide together on the best size for harriet  her many\\nbeginnings were displayed  miniatures halflengths wholelengths\\npencil crayon and watercolours had been all tried in turn\\nshe had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress\\nboth in drawing and music than many might have done with so little\\nlabour as she would ever submit to  she played and sangand drew\\nin almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting\\nand in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she\\nwould have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of\\nshe was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist\\nor a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived\\nor sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher\\nthan it deserved\\n\\nthere was merit in every drawingin the least finished perhaps the most\\nher style was spirited but had there been much less or had there\\nbeen ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions\\nwould have been the same  they were both in ecstasies  a likeness\\npleases every body and miss woodhouses performances must be capital\\n\\nno great variety of faces for you said emma  i had only my\\nown family to study from  there is my fatheranother of my\\nfatherbut the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous\\nthat i could only take him by stealth neither of them very\\nlike therefore  mrs weston again and again and again you see\\ndear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion\\nshe would sit whenever i asked her  there is my sister and really\\nquite her own little elegant figureand the face not unlike\\ni should have made a good likeness of her if she would have\\nsat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four\\nchildren that she would not be quiet  then here come all my\\nattempts at three of those four childrenthere they are\\nhenry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other\\nand any one of them might do for any one of the rest  she was so\\neager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no\\nmaking children of three or four years old stand still you know\\nnor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the\\nair and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any\\nof mamas children ever were  here is my sketch of the fourth\\nwho was a baby  i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it\\nis as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see\\nhe had nestled down his head most conveniently  thats very like\\ni am rather proud of little george  the corner of the sofa is very good\\nthen here is my lastunclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\\nin small size wholelengthmy last and my bestmy brother\\nmr john knightleythis did not want much of being finished when i\\nput it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness\\ni could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i\\nhad really made a very good likeness of itmrs weston and i\\nwere quite agreed in thinking it very likeonly too handsometoo\\nflatteringbut that was a fault on the right sideafter\\nall this came poor dear isabellas cold approbation ofyes\\nit was a little likebut to be sure it did not do him justice\\nwe had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all\\nit was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i\\ncould bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised\\nover as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in\\nbrunswick squareand as i said i did then forswear ever drawing\\nany body again  but for harriets sake or rather for my own\\nand as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present\\ni will break my resolution now\\n\\nmr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea\\nand was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present\\nindeed as you observe  exactly so  no husbands and wives\\nwith so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider\\nwhether she had not better leave them together at once  but as she\\nwanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer\\n\\nshe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait\\nit was to be a wholelength in watercolours like mr john\\nknightleys and was destined if she could please herself\\nto hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece\\n\\nthe sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid\\nof not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet\\nmixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist\\nbut there was no doing any thing with mr elton fidgeting behind\\nher and watching every touch  she gave him credit for stationing\\nhimself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence\\nbut was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to\\nplace himself elsewhere  it then occurred to her to employ him\\nin reading\\n\\nif he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness\\nindeed it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen\\nthe irksomeness of miss smiths\\n\\nmr elton was only too happy  harriet listened and emma drew\\nin peace  she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look\\nany thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover\\nand he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil\\nto jump up and see the progress and be charmedthere was no\\nbeing displeased with such an encourager for his admiration\\nmade him discern a likeness almost before it was possible\\nshe could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance\\nwere unexceptionable\\n\\nthe sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite\\nenough pleased with the first days sketch to wish to go on\\nthere was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude\\nand as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure\\nto give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had\\ngreat confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last\\nand of its filling its destined place with credit to them botha\\nstanding memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other\\nand the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations\\nas mr eltons very promising attachment was likely to add\\n\\nharriet was to sit again the next day and mr elton just as he ought\\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again\\n\\nby all means  we shall be most happy to consider you as one\\nof the party\\n\\nthe same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction\\ntook place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress\\nof the picture which was rapid and happy  every body who saw it\\nwas pleased but mr elton was in continual raptures and defended\\nit through every criticism\\n\\nmiss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\nwantedobserved mrs weston to himnot in the least suspecting\\nthat she was addressing a loverthe expression of the eye is\\nmost correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes\\nit is the fault of her face that she has them not\\n\\ndo you think so replied he  i cannot agree with you\\nit appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature\\ni never saw such a likeness in my life  we must allow for the effect\\nof shade you know\\n\\nyou have made her too tall emma said mr knightley\\n\\nemma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmly added\\n\\noh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall  consider\\nshe is sitting downwhich naturally presents a differentwhich\\nin short gives exactly the ideaand the proportions must\\nbe preserved you know  proportions foreshorteningoh no it\\ngives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smiths exactly so indeed\\n\\nit is very pretty said mr woodhouse  so prettily done just\\nas your drawings always are my dear  i do not know any body who draws\\nso well as you do  the only thing i do not thoroughly like is\\nthat she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl\\nover her shouldersand it makes one think she must catch cold\\n\\nbut my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer\\nlook at the tree\\n\\nbut it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear\\n\\nyou sir may say any thing cried mr elton but i must confess\\nthat i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss\\nsmith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable\\nspirit any other situation would have been much less in character\\nthe naivete of miss smiths mannersand altogetheroh it is\\nmost admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it  i never saw such\\na likeness\\n\\nthe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a\\nfew difficulties  it must be done directly it must be done in london\\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\\ncould be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions\\nmust not be applied to because it was december and mr woodhouse\\ncould not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs\\nof december  but no sooner was the distress known to mr elton\\nthan it was removed  his gallantry was always on the alert\\nmight he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure\\nshould he have in executing it he could ride to london at any time\\nit was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being\\nemployed on such an errand\\n\\nhe was too goodshe could not endure the thoughtshe would\\nnot give him such a troublesome office for the worldbrought\\non the desired repetition of entreaties and assurancesand\\na very few minutes settled the business\\n\\nmr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame\\nand give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it\\nas to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he\\nseemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough\\n\\nwhat a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he\\nreceived it\\n\\nthis man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma\\ni should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different\\nways of being in love  he is an excellent young man and will suit\\nharriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself\\nbut he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more\\nthan i could endure as a principal  i come in for a pretty good\\nshare as a second  but it is his gratitude on harriets account\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii\\n\\n\\nthe very day of mr eltons going to london produced a fresh occasion\\nfor emmas services towards her friend  harriet had been at hartfield\\nas usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home\\nto return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been\\ntalked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something\\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell\\nhalf a minute brought it all out  she had heard as soon as she got\\nback to mrs goddards that mr martin had been there an hour before\\nand finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left\\na little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away\\nand on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two\\nsongs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself\\nand this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct\\nproposal of marriage  who could have thought it she was so surprized\\nshe did not know what to do  yes quite a proposal of marriage\\nand a very good letter at least she thought so  and he wrote\\nas if he really loved her very muchbut she did not knowand so\\nshe was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she\\nshould do emma was halfashamed of her friend for seeming so\\npleased and so doubtful\\n\\nupon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose\\nany thing for want of asking  he will connect himself well if he can\\n\\nwill you read the letter cried harriet  pray do  id rather\\nyou would\\n\\nemma was not sorry to be pressed  she read and was surprized\\nthe style of the letter was much above her expectation\\nthere were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it\\nwould not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain\\nwas strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much\\nto the credit of the writer  it was short but expressed good sense\\nwarm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling\\nshe paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for\\nher opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add\\nis it a good letter or is it too short\\n\\nyes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowlyso\\ngood a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of\\nhis sisters must have helped him  i can hardly imagine the young\\nman whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself\\nso well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the\\nstyle of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise\\nnot diffuse enough for a woman  no doubt he is a sensible man\\nand i suppose may have a natural talent forthinks strongly and\\nclearlyand when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find\\nproper words  it is so with some men  yes i understand the sort\\nof mind  vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point\\nnot coarse  a better written letter harriet returning it\\nthan i had expected\\n\\nwell said the still waiting harrietwellandand what\\nshall i do\\n\\nwhat shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard\\nto this letter\\n\\nyes\\n\\nbut what are you in doubt of you must answer it of courseand speedily\\n\\nyes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me\\n\\noh no no the letter had much better be all your own  you will\\nexpress yourself very properly i am sure  there is no danger of your\\nnot being intelligible which is the first thing  your meaning must\\nbe unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude\\nand concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires\\nwill present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded\\nyou need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow\\nfor his disappointment\\n\\nyou think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down\\n\\nought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you\\nin any doubt as to that i thoughtbut i beg your pardon perhaps i\\nhave been under a mistake  i certainly have been misunderstanding\\nyou if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer\\ni had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it\\n\\nharriet was silent  with a little reserve of manner emma continued\\n\\nyou mean to return a favourable answer i collect\\n\\nno i do not that is i do not meanwhat shall i do what would\\nyou advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i\\nought to do\\n\\ni shall not give you any advice harriet  i will have nothing to\\ndo with it  this is a point which you must settle with your feelings\\n\\ni had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet\\ncontemplating the letter  for a little while emma persevered\\nin her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery\\nof that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say\\n\\ni lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts\\nas to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought\\nto refuse him  if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say\\nno directly  it is not a state to be safely entered into\\nwith doubtful feelings with half a heart  i thought it my duty\\nas a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you\\nbut do not imagine that i want to influence you\\n\\noh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind tobut if you\\nwould just advise me what i had best dono no i do not mean\\nthatas you say ones mind ought to be quite made upone should\\nnot be hesitatingit is a very serious thingit will be safer\\nto say no perhapsdo you think i had better say no\\n\\nnot for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise\\nyou either way  you must be the best judge of your own happiness\\nif you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him\\nthe most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should\\nyou hesitate you blush harrietdoes any body else occur to you\\nat this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not\\ndeceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion\\nat this moment whom are you thinking of\\n\\nthe symptoms were favourableinstead of answering harriet turned\\naway confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though\\nthe letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted\\nabout without regard  emma waited the result with impatience\\nbut not without strong hopes  at last with some hesitation\\nharriet said\\n\\nmiss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must\\ndo as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined\\nand really almost made up my mindto refuse mr martin  do you\\nthink i am right\\n\\nperfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just\\nwhat you ought  while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings\\nto myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no\\nhesitation in approving  dear harriet i give myself joy of this\\nit would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have\\nbeen the consequence of your marrying mr martin  while you were in\\nthe smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would\\nnot influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me\\ni could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbeymill farm\\nnow i am secure of you for ever\\n\\nharriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck\\nher forcibly\\n\\nyou could not have visited me she cried looking aghast\\nno to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before\\nthat would have been too dreadfulwhat an escapedear miss woodhouse\\ni would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you\\nfor any thing in the world\\n\\nindeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you\\nbut it must have been  you would have thrown yourself out of all\\ngood society  i must have given you up\\n\\ndear mehow should i ever have borne it it would have killed\\nme never to come to hartfield any more\\n\\ndear affectionate creatureyou banished to abbeymill farmyou\\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life\\ni wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it\\nhe must have a pretty good opinion of himself\\n\\ni do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet\\nher conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured\\nand i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard\\nforbut that is quite a different thing fromand you know\\nthough he may like me it does not follow that i shouldand\\ncertainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen\\npeopleand if one comes to compare them person and manners\\nthere is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable\\nhowever i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man\\nand have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached\\nto meand his writing such a letterbut as to leaving you\\nit is what i would not do upon any consideration\\n\\nthank you thank you my own sweet little friend  we will not\\nbe parted  a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked\\nor because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter\\n\\noh noand it is but a short letter too\\n\\nemma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a\\nvery true and it would be a small consolation to her for the\\nclownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day\\nto know that her husband could write a good letter\\n\\noh yes very  nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always\\nhappy with pleasant companions  i am quite determined to refuse him\\nbut how shall i do what shall i say\\n\\nemma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer\\nand advised its being written directly which was agreed to\\nin the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest\\nagainst any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the\\nformation of every sentence  the looking over his letter again\\nin replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was\\nparticularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions\\nand she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy\\nand thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say\\nand was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful\\nthat emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment\\nhe would have been accepted after all\\n\\nthis letter however was written and sealed and sent\\nthe business was finished and harriet safe  she was rather low\\nall the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets\\nand sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection\\nsometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr elton\\n\\ni shall never be invited to abbeymill again was said in rather\\na sorrowful tone\\n\\nnor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet\\nyou are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared\\nto abbeymill\\n\\nand i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy\\nbut at hartfield\\n\\nsome time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very\\nmuch surprized if she knew what had happened  i am sure miss nash\\nwouldfor miss nash thinks her own sister very well married\\nand it is only a linendraper\\n\\none should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the\\nteacher of a school harriet  i dare say miss nash would envy you\\nsuch an opportunity as this of being married  even this conquest\\nwould appear valuable in her eyes  as to any thing superior for you\\ni suppose she is quite in the dark  the attentions of a certain\\nperson can hardly be among the tittletattle of highbury yet\\nhitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks\\nand manners have explained themselves\\n\\nharriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering\\nthat people should like her so much  the idea of mr elton was\\ncertainly cheering but still after a time she was tenderhearted\\nagain towards the rejected mr martin\\n\\nnow he has got my letter said she softly  i wonder what they\\nare all doingwhether his sisters knowif he is unhappy\\nthey will be unhappy too  i hope he will not mind it so very much\\n\\nlet us think of those among our absent friends who are more\\ncheerfully employed cried emma  at this moment perhaps mr elton\\nis shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much\\nmore beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five\\nor six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name\\n\\nmy picturebut he has left my picture in bondstreet\\n\\nhas he sothen i know nothing of mr elton  no my dear\\nlittle modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be\\nin bondstreet till just before he mounts his horse tomorrow\\nit is his companion all this evening his solace his delight\\nit opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them\\nit diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature\\neager curiosity and warm prepossession  how cheerful how animated\\nhow suspicious how busy their imaginations all are\\n\\nharriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii\\n\\n\\nharriet slept at hartfield that night  for some weeks past she\\nhad been spending more than half her time there and gradually\\ngetting to have a bedroom appropriated to herself and emma\\njudged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her\\nwith them as much as possible just at present  she was obliged\\nto go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs goddards\\nbut it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield\\nto make a regular visit of some days\\n\\nwhile she was gone mr knightley called and sat some time with\\nmr woodhouse and emma till mr woodhouse who had previously made up\\nhis mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it\\nand was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples\\nof his own civility to leave mr knightley for that purpose\\nmr knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering\\nby his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted\\napologies and civil hesitations of the other\\n\\nwell i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you\\nwill not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take\\nemmas advice and go out for a quarter of an hour  as the sun\\nis out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can\\ni treat you without ceremony mr knightley  we invalids think we\\nare privileged people\\n\\nmy dear sir do not make a stranger of me\\n\\ni leave an excellent substitute in my daughter  emma will be happy\\nto entertain you  and therefore i think i will beg your excuse\\nand take my three turnsmy winter walk\\n\\nyou cannot do better sir\\n\\ni would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley\\nbut i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you\\nand besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey\\n\\nthank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i\\nthink the sooner you go the better  i will fetch your greatcoat\\nand open the garden door for you\\n\\nmr woodhouse at last was off but mr knightley instead of being\\nimmediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined\\nfor more chat  he began speaking of harriet and speaking\\nof her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before\\n\\ni cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a\\npretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of\\nher disposition  her character depends upon those she is with\\nbut in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman\\n\\ni am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting\\n\\ncome said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will\\ntell you that you have improved her  you have cured her of her\\nschoolgirls giggle she really does you credit\\n\\nthank you  i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i\\nhad been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow\\npraise where they may  you do not often overpower me with it\\n\\nyou are expecting her again you say this morning\\n\\nalmost every moment  she has been gone longer already than\\nshe intended\\n\\nsomething has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps\\n\\nhighbury gossipstiresome wretches\\n\\nharriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would\\n\\nemma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore\\nsaid nothing  he presently added with a smile\\n\\ni do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you\\nthat i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon\\nhear of something to her advantage\\n\\nindeed how so of what sort\\n\\na very serious sort i assure you still smiling\\n\\nvery serious i can think of but one thingwho is in love\\nwith her who makes you their confidant\\n\\nemma was more than half in hopes of mr eltons having dropt a hint\\nmr knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew\\nmr elton looked up to him\\n\\ni have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will\\nsoon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable\\nquarterrobert martin is the man  her visit to abbeymill\\nthis summer seems to have done his business  he is desperately\\nin love and means to marry her\\n\\nhe is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet\\nmeans to marry him\\n\\nwell well means to make her an offer then  will that do he came\\nto the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it\\nhe knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and\\ni believe considers me as one of his best friends  he came to ask\\nme whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early\\nwhether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his\\nchoice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being\\nconsidered especially since your making so much of her as in a line\\nof society above him  i was very much pleased with all that he said\\ni never hear better sense from any one than robert martin\\nhe always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very\\nwell judging  he told me every thing his circumstances and plans\\nand what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage  he is\\nan excellent young man both as son and brother  i had no hesitation\\nin advising him to marry  he proved to me that he could afford it\\nand that being the case i was convinced he could not do better\\ni praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy\\nif he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought\\nhighly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the\\nbest friend and counsellor man ever had  this happened the night\\nbefore last  now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow\\nmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not\\nappear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should\\nbe at mrs goddards today and she may be detained by a visitor\\nwithout thinking him at all a tiresome wretch\\n\\npray mr knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself\\nthrough a great part of this speech how do you know that mr martin\\ndid not speak yesterday\\n\\ncertainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it\\nbut it may be inferred  was not she the whole day with you\\n\\ncome said she i will tell you something in return for what\\nyou have told me  he did speak yesterdaythat is he wrote\\nand was refused\\n\\nthis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed\\nand mr knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure\\nas he stood up in tall indignation and said\\n\\nthen she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her\\nwhat is the foolish girl about\\n\\noh to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible\\nto a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage\\na man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her\\n\\nnonsense a man does not imagine any such thing  but what is\\nthe meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness\\nif it is so but i hope you are mistaken\\n\\ni saw her answernothing could be clearer\\n\\nyou saw her answeryou wrote her answer too  emma this is\\nyour doing  you persuaded her to refuse him\\n\\nand if i did which however i am far from allowing i should\\nnot feel that i had done wrong  mr martin is a very respectable\\nyoung man but i cannot admit him to be harriets equal and am\\nrather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her\\nby your account he does seem to have had some scruples  it is\\na pity that they were ever got over\\n\\nnot harriets equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly and warmly\\nand with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he\\nis not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense\\nas in situation  emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you\\nwhat are harriet smiths claims either of birth nature or education\\nto any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural\\ndaughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision\\nat all and certainly no respectable relations  she is known only\\nas parlourboarder at a common school  she is not a sensible girl\\nnor a girl of any information  she has been taught nothing useful\\nand is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself\\nat her age she can have no experience and with her little wit\\nis not very likely ever to have any that can avail her\\nshe is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all\\nmy only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being\\nbeneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him  i felt that\\nas to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as\\nto a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse\\nbut i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing\\nto trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort\\nof disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led\\naright and turn out very well  the advantage of the match i felt\\nto be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now\\nthat there would be a general cryout upon her extreme good luck\\neven your satisfaction i made sure of  it crossed my mind immediately\\nthat you would not regret your friends leaving highbury for the\\nsake of her being settled so well  i remember saying to myself\\neven emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a\\ngood match\\n\\ni cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say\\nany such thing  what think a farmer and with all his sense and all\\nhis merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate\\nfriend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying\\na man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i\\nwonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings\\ni assure you mine are very different  i must think your statement\\nby no means fair  you are not just to harriets claims\\nthey would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself\\nmr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly\\nher inferior as to rank in societythe sphere in which she moves\\nis much above hisit would be a degradation\\n\\na degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married\\nto a respectable intelligent gentlemanfarmer\\n\\nas to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense\\nshe may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense\\nshe is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below\\nthe level of those with whom she is brought upthere can scarcely\\nbe a doubt that her father is a gentlemanand a gentleman of\\nfortuneher allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged\\nfor her improvement or comfortthat she is a gentlemans daughter\\nis indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemens daughters\\nno one i apprehend will denyshe is superior to mr robert martin\\n\\nwhoever might be her parents said mr knightley whoever may\\nhave had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part\\nof their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society\\nafter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in\\nmrs goddards hands to shift as she canto move in short\\nin mrs goddards line to have mrs goddards acquaintance\\nher friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was\\ngood enough  she desired nothing better herself  till you chose\\nto turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set\\nnor any ambition beyond it  she was as happy as possible with the\\nmartins in the summer  she had no sense of superiority then\\nif she has it now you have given it  you have been no friend to\\nharriet smith emma  robert martin would never have proceeded so far\\nif he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him\\ni know him well  he has too much real feeling to address any\\nwoman on the haphazard of selfish passion  and as to conceit\\nhe is the farthest from it of any man i know  depend upon it he\\nhad encouragement\\n\\nit was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this\\nassertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again\\n\\nyou are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before\\nare unjust to harriet  harriets claims to marry well are not\\nso contemptible as you represent them  she is not a clever girl\\nbut she has better sense than you are aware of and does not\\ndeserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly\\nwaiving that point however and supposing her to be as you\\ndescribe her only pretty and goodnatured let me tell you that in\\nthe degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations\\nto the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl\\nand must be thought so by ninetynine people out of an hundred\\nand till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject\\nof beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall\\nin love with wellinformed minds instead of handsome faces a girl\\nwith such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired\\nand sought after of having the power of chusing from among many\\nconsequently a claim to be nice  her goodnature too is not so very\\nslight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness\\nof temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great\\nreadiness to be pleased with other people  i am very much mistaken\\nif your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper\\nthe highest claims a woman could possess\\n\\nupon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have\\nis almost enough to make me think so too  better be without sense\\nthan misapply it as you do\\n\\nto be sure cried she playfully  i know that is the feeling\\nof you all  i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly\\nwhat every man delights inwhat at once bewitches his senses\\nand satisfies his judgment  oh harriet may pick and chuse\\nwere you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you\\nand is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning\\nto be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first\\noffer she receives nopray let her have time to look about her\\n\\ni have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr knightley\\npresently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now\\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet\\nyou will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what\\nshe has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her\\nreach will be good enough for her  vanity working on a weak head\\nproduces every sort of mischief  nothing so easy as for a young lady\\nto raise her expectations too high  miss harriet smith may not find\\noffers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl\\nmen of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives\\nmen of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves\\nwith a girl of such obscurityand most prudent men would be\\nafraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in\\nwhen the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed  let her marry\\nrobert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever\\nbut if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach\\nher to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence\\nand large fortune she may be a parlourboarder at mrs goddards\\nall the rest of her lifeor at least for harriet smith is a\\ngirl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate\\nand is glad to catch at the old writingmasters son\\n\\nwe think so very differently on this point mr knightley\\nthat there can be no use in canvassing it  we shall only be making\\neach other more angry  but as to my letting her marry robert martin\\nit is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think\\nas must prevent any second application  she must abide by the evil\\nof having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself\\ni will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little\\nbut i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do\\nhis appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad\\nthat if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now\\ni can imagine that before she had seen any body superior\\nshe might tolerate him  he was the brother of her friends\\nand he took pains to please her and altogether having seen\\nnobody better that must have been his great assistant\\nshe might not while she was at abbeymill find him disagreeable\\nbut the case is altered now  she knows now what gentlemen are\\nand nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\\nwith harriet\\n\\nnonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr knightleyrobert\\nmartins manners have sense sincerity and goodhumour to recommend\\nthem and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand\\n\\nemma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was\\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone\\nshe did not repent what she had done she still thought herself\\na better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he\\ncould be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment\\nin general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her\\nand to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state\\nwas very disagreeable  some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence\\nwith only one attempt on emmas side to talk of the weather\\nbut he made no answer  he was thinking  the result of his thoughts\\nappeared at last in these words\\n\\nrobert martin has no great lossif he can but think so and i\\nhope it will not be long before he does  your views for harriet\\nare best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love\\nof matchmaking it is fair to suppose that views and plans\\nand projects you haveand as a friend i shall just hint to you\\nthat if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain\\n\\nemma laughed and disclaimed  he continued\\n\\ndepend upon it elton will not do  elton is a very good sort of man\\nand a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely\\nto make an imprudent match  he knows the value of a good income\\nas well as any body  elton may talk sentimentally but he will\\nact rationally  he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you\\ncan be with harriets he knows that he is a very handsome young man\\nand a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way\\nof talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present\\ni am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away\\ni have heard him speak with great animation of a large family\\nof young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all\\ntwenty thousand pounds apiece\\n\\ni am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again\\nif i had set my heart on mr eltons marrying harriet it would\\nhave been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want\\nto keep harriet to myself  i have done with matchmaking indeed\\ni could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls  i shall leave\\noff while i am well\\n\\ngood morning to yousaid he rising and walking off abruptly\\nhe was very much vexed  he felt the disappointment of the young man\\nand was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the\\nsanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had\\ntaken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly\\n\\nemma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more\\nindistinctness in the causes of hers than in his  she did not always\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that\\nher opinions were right and her adversarys wrong as mr knightley\\nhe walked off in more complete selfapprobation than he left for her\\nshe was not so materially cast down however but that a little\\ntime and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives\\nharriets staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy\\nthe possibility of the young mans coming to mrs goddards\\nthat morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause\\ngave alarming ideas  the dread of such a failure after all became the\\nprominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits\\nand without having any such reason to give for her long absence\\nshe felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind\\nand convinced her that let mr knightley think or say what he would\\nshe had done nothing which womans friendship and womans feelings\\nwould not justify\\n\\nhe had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered\\nthat mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done\\nneither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself\\nin spite of mr knightleys pretensions with the skill of such\\nan observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it\\nhastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather\\nsaid what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew\\nany thing about  he certainly might have heard mr elton speak\\nwith more unreserve than she had ever done and mr elton might not\\nbe of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters\\nhe might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them\\nbut then mr knightley did not make due allowance for the influence\\nof a strong passion at war with all interested motives  mr knightley\\nsaw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects\\nbut she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any\\nhesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest\\nand more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very\\nsure did not belong to mr elton\\n\\nharriets cheerful look and manner established hers she came back\\nnot to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton  miss nash\\nhad been telling her something which she repeated immediately\\nwith great delight  mr perry had been to mrs goddards to attend\\na sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash\\nthat as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met\\nmr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was\\nactually on his road to london and not meaning to return till\\nthe morrow though it was the whistclub night which he had been\\nnever known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him\\nabout it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player\\nto absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off\\nhis journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been\\ndetermined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed\\nthat he was going on business which he would not put off for any\\ninducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission\\nand being the bearer of something exceedingly precious  mr perry\\ncould not quite understand him but he was very sure there must\\nbe a lady in the case and he told him so and mr elton only\\nlooked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits\\nmiss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more\\nabout mr elton and said looking so very significantly at her\\nthat she did not pretend to understand what his business might be\\nbut she only knew that any woman whom mr elton could prefer\\nshe should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt\\nmr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix\\n\\n\\nmr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel\\nwith herself  he was so much displeased that it was longer than\\nusual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet\\nhis grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven  she was sorry\\nbut could not repent  on the contrary her plans and proceedings\\nwere more and more justified and endeared to her by the general\\nappearances of the next few days\\n\\nthe picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after\\nmr eltons return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\\nsittingroom he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences\\nof admiration just as he ought and as for harriets feelings they were\\nvisibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment\\nas her youth and sort of mind admitted  emma was soon perfectly\\nsatisfied of mr martins being no otherwise remembered than as\\nhe furnished a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantage to the latter\\n\\nher views of improving her little friends mind by a great deal\\nof useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than\\na few first chapters and the intention of going on tomorrow\\nit was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let\\nher imagination range and work at harriets fortune than to be\\nlabouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts\\nand the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present\\nthe only mental provision she was making for the evening of life\\nwas the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort\\nthat she could meet with into a thin quarto of hotpressed paper\\nmade up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies\\n\\nin this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale\\nare not uncommon  miss nash headteacher at mrs goddards\\nhad written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken\\nthe first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouses help\\nto get a great many more  emma assisted with her invention\\nmemory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand\\nit was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form\\nas well as quantity\\n\\nmr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls\\nand tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in\\nso many clever riddles as there used to be when he was younghe\\nwondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time\\nand it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid\\n\\nhis good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject\\ndid not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind\\nbut he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about\\nso much something he thought might come from that quarter\\n\\nit was by no means his daughters wish that the intellects of\\nhighbury in general should be put under requisition  mr elton\\nwas the only one whose assistance she asked  he was invited\\nto contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums\\nthat he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him\\nmost intently at work with his recollections and at the same time\\nas she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant\\nnothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass\\nhis lips  they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles\\nand the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled\\nand rather sentimentally recited that wellknown charade\\n\\n    my first doth affliction denote\\n      which my second is destind to feel\\n    and my whole is the best antidote\\n      that affliction to soften and heal\\n\\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it\\nsome pages ago already\\n\\nwhy will not you write one yourself for us mr elton said she\\nthat is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be\\neasier to you\\n\\noh no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind\\nin his life  the stupidest fellow he was afraid not even miss\\nwoodhousehe stopt a momentor miss smith could inspire him\\n\\nthe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration\\nhe called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the\\ntable containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had\\naddressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which\\nfrom his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own\\n\\ni do not offer it for miss smiths collection said he\\nbeing my friends i have no right to expose it in any degree\\nto the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it\\n\\nthe speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma\\ncould understand  there was deep consciousness about him\\nand he found it easier to meet her eye than her friends\\nhe was gone the next momentafter another moments pause\\n\\ntake it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards\\nharrietit is for you  take your own\\n\\nbut harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and

break off from these very pleasant observations\\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the\\neagerness of harriets wondering questions\\n\\nwhat can it be miss woodhousewhat can

yesterday\\n\\ni do think it is without exception the best charade i ever read\\n\\ni never read one more to the purpose certainly\\n\\nit is as long again as almost all we have had before\\n\\ni do not consider its length as particularly in its favour\\nsuch things in general cannot be too short\\n\\nharriet was too intent on the lines to hear  the most satisfactory\\ncomparisons were rising in

at all the less written you know\\nbecause you divide them  the couplet does not cease to be nor does\\nits meaning change  but take it away and all appropriation ceases\\nand a very pretty gallant

replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer\\nit lasts the better i shall be pleased  but here is my father\\ncoming you will not object to my reading the charade to him\\nit will be giving him so much pleasure he loves any thing of\\nthe sort and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment\\nhe has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us allyou must\\nlet me read it to him\\n\\nharriet looked grave\\n\\nmy dear harriet you must not refine too much upon this\\ncharadeyou will betray your feelings improperly if you are\\ntoo conscious and too quick and appear to affix more meaning\\nor even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it\\ndo not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration\\nif he had been anxious for secrecy he would not have left the paper\\nwhile i was by but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you\\ndo not let us be too solemn on the business  he has encouragement\\nenough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade\\n\\noh noi hope i shall not be ridiculous about it  do as you please\\n\\nmr woodhouse came in and very soon led to the subject again\\nby the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of well my dears\\nhow does your book go onhave you got any thing fresh\\n\\nyes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh\\na piece of paper was found on the table this morningdropt\\nwe suppose by a fairycontaining a very pretty charade and we\\nhave just copied it in\\n\\nshe read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read\\nslowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations\\nof every part as she proceededand he was very much pleased and\\nas she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion\\n\\naye thats very just indeed thats very properly said\\nvery true  woman lovely woman it is such a pretty charade\\nmy dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought itnobody\\ncould have written so prettily but you emma\\n\\nemma only nodded and smiledafter a little thinking\\nand a very tender sigh he added\\n\\nah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother\\nwas so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i\\ncan remember nothingnot even that particular riddle which you\\nhave heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza\\nand there are several\\n\\n    kitty a fair but frozen maid\\n      kindled a flame i yet deplore\\n    the hoodwinkd boy i called to aid\\n    though of his near approach afraid\\n      so fatal to my suit before\\n\\nand that is all that i can recollect of itbut it is very clever\\nall the way through  but i think my dear you said you had got it\\n\\nyes papa it is written out in our second page  we copied it\\nfrom the elegant extracts  it was garricks you know\\n\\naye very truei wish i could recollect more of it\\n\\n    kitty a fair but frozen maid\\n\\nthe name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near\\nbeing christened catherine after her grandmama  i hope we shall\\nhave her here next week  have you thought my dear where you\\nshall put herand what room there will be for the children\\n\\noh yesshe will have her own room of course the room she always\\nhasand there is the nursery for the childrenjust as usual\\nyou know  why should there be any change\\n\\ni do not know my dearbut it is so long since she was herenot\\nsince last easter and then only for a few daysmr john knightleys\\nbeing a lawyer is very inconvenientpoor isabellashe is sadly\\ntaken away from us alland how sorry she will be when she comes\\nnot to see miss taylor here\\n\\nshe will not be surprized papa at least\\n\\ni do not know my dear  i am sure i was very much surprized\\nwhen i first heard she was going to be married\\n\\nwe must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella\\nis here\\n\\nyes my dear if there is timebutin a very depressed toneshe\\nis coming for only one week  there will not be time for any thing\\n\\nit is unfortunate that they cannot stay longerbut it seems a case\\nof necessity  mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th\\nand we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole\\nof the time they can give to the country that two or three days\\nare not to be taken out for the abbey  mr knightley promises\\nto give up his claim this christmasthough you know it is longer\\nsince they were with him than with us\\n\\nit would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were\\nto be anywhere but at hartfield\\n\\nmr woodhouse could never allow for mr knightleys claims on\\nhis brother or any bodys claims on isabella except his own\\nhe sat musing a little while and then said\\n\\nbut i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back\\nso soon though he does  i think emma i shall try and persuade\\nher to stay longer with us  she and the children might stay very well\\n\\nah papathat is what you never have been able to accomplish\\nand i do not think you ever will  isabella cannot bear to stay\\nbehind her husband\\n\\nthis was too true for contradiction  unwelcome as it was mr woodhouse\\ncould only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits\\naffected by the idea of his daughters attachment to her husband\\nshe immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them\\n\\nharriet must give us as much of her company as she can while\\nmy brother and sister are here  i am sure she will be pleased\\nwith the children  we are very proud of the children are not we\\npapa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john\\n\\naye i wonder which she will  poor little dears how glad they\\nwill be to come  they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet\\n\\ni dare say they are sir  i am sure i do not know who is not\\n\\nhenry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama  henry is the eldest\\nhe was named after me not after his father  john the second\\nis named after his father  some people are surprized i believe\\nthat the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry\\nwhich i thought very pretty of her  and he is a very clever boy\\nindeed  they are all remarkably clever and they have so many\\npretty ways  they will come and stand by my chair and say\\ngrandpapa can you give me a bit of string and once henry asked me\\nfor a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas\\ni think their father is too rough with them very often\\n\\nhe appears rough to you said emma because you are so very\\ngentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas\\nyou would not think him rough  he wishes his boys to be active and hardy\\nand if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then\\nbut he is an affectionate fathercertainly mr john knightley\\nis an affectionate father  the children are all fond of him\\n\\nand then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling\\nin a very frightful way\\n\\nbut they like it papa there is nothing they like so much\\nit is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down\\nthe rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way\\nto the other\\n\\nwell i cannot understand it\\n\\nthat is the case with us all papa  one half of the world cannot\\nunderstand the pleasures of the other\\n\\nlater in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate\\nin preparation for the regular four oclock dinner the hero\\nof this inimitable charade walked in again  harriet turned away\\nbut emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye\\nsoon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a pushof\\nhaving thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it\\nmight turn up  his ostensible reason however was to ask whether\\nmr woodhouses party could be made up in the evening without him\\nor whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield\\nif he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend\\ncole had been saying so much about his dining with himhad made\\nsuch a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come\\n\\nemma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his\\nfriend on their account her father was sure of his rubber\\nhe reurgedshe redeclined and he seemed then about to make\\nhis bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it\\n\\noh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us\\nthank you for the sight of it  we admired it so much that i have\\nventured to write it into miss smiths collection  your friend\\nwill not take it amiss i hope  of course i have not transcribed\\nbeyond the first eight lines\\n\\nmr elton certainly did not very well know what to say\\nhe looked rather doubtinglyrather confused said something about\\nhonourglanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book\\nopen on the table took it up and examined it very attentively\\nwith the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said\\n\\nyou must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade\\nmust not be confined to one or two  he may be sure of every womans\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry\\n\\ni have no hesitation in saying replied mr elton though hesitating\\na good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in sayingat\\nleast if my friend feels at all as i doi have not the smallest\\ndoubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it\\nlooking at the book again and replacing it on the table he\\nwould consider it as the proudest moment of his life\\n\\nafter this speech he was gone as soon as possible  emma could not\\nthink it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities\\nthere was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt\\nto incline her to laugh  she ran away to indulge the inclination\\nleaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriets share\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x\\n\\n\\nthough now the middle of december there had yet been no weather\\nto prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise\\nand on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor\\nsick family who lived a little way out of highbury\\n\\ntheir road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane\\nleading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street\\nof the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode\\nof mr elton  a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed\\nand then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage\\nan old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it\\ncould be  it had no advantage of situation but had been very much\\nsmartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was\\nthere could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without\\na slackened pace and observing eyesemmas remark was\\n\\nthere it is  there go you and your riddlebook one of these days\\nharriets was\\n\\noh what a sweet househow very beautifulthere are the yellow\\ncurtains that miss nash admires so much\\n\\ni do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded\\nbut then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get\\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards\\nof this part of highbury\\n\\nharriet she found had never in her life been within side the vicarage\\nand her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors\\nand probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love\\nwith mr eltons seeing ready wit in her\\n\\ni wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think\\nof any tolerable pretence for going inno servant that i want\\nto inquire about of his housekeeperno message from my father\\n\\nshe pondered but could think of nothing  after a mutual silence\\nof some minutes harriet thus began again\\n\\ni do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married\\nor going to be married so charming as you are\\n\\nemma laughed and replied\\n\\nmy being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry\\ni must find other people charmingone other person at least\\nand i am not only not going to be married at present but have\\nvery little intention of ever marrying at all\\n\\nahso you say but i cannot believe it\\n\\ni must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet\\nto be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself\\nis out of the question  and i do not wish to see any such person\\ni would rather not be tempted  i cannot really change for the better\\nif i were to marry i must expect to repent it\\n\\ndear meit is so odd to hear a woman talk so\\n\\ni have none of the usual inducements of women to marry\\nwere i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing\\nbut i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature\\nand i do not think i ever shall  and without love i am sure i\\nshould be a fool to change such a situation as mine  fortune i\\ndo not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want\\ni believe few married women are half as much mistress of their\\nhusbands house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect\\nto be so truly beloved and important so always first and always\\nright in any mans eyes as i am in my fathers\\n\\nbut then to be an old maid at last like miss bates\\n\\nthat is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i\\nthought i should ever be like miss bates so sillyso satisfied\\nso smilingso prosingso undistinguishing and unfastidious\\nand so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me\\ni would marry tomorrow but between us i am convinced there never\\ncan be any likeness except in being unmarried\\n\\nbut still you will be an old maid and thats so dreadful\\n\\nnever mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is\\npoverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public\\na single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous\\ndisagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls\\nbut a single woman of good fortune is always respectable\\nand may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else  and the\\ndistinction is not quite so much against the candour and common\\nsense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income\\nhas a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper\\nthose who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small\\nand generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross\\nthis does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good\\nnatured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very\\nmuch to the taste of every body though single and though poor\\npoverty certainly has not contracted her mind  i really believe\\nif she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely\\nto give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her  that is a\\ngreat charm\\n\\ndear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself\\nwhen you grow old\\n\\nif i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great\\nmany independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be\\nmore in want of employment at forty or fifty than oneandtwenty\\nwomans usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then\\nas they are now or with no important variation  if i draw less\\ni shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpetwork\\nand as for objects of interest objects for the affections\\nwhich is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which\\nis really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall\\nbe very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much\\nto care about  there will be enough of them in all probability\\nto supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need\\nthere will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my\\nattachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas\\nof comfort better than what is warmer and blinder  my nephews\\nand niecesi shall often have a niece with me\\n\\ndo you know miss batess niece  that is i know you must have\\nseen her a hundred timesbut are you acquainted\\n\\noh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes\\nto highbury  by the bye that is almost enough to put one out\\nof conceit with a niece  heaven forbid at least that i should\\never bore people half so much about all the knightleys together\\nas she does about jane fairfax  one is sick of the very name\\nof jane fairfax  every letter from her is read forty times over\\nher compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she\\ndoes but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair\\nof garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month\\ni wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death\\n\\nthey were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics\\nwere superseded  emma was very compassionate and the distresses\\nof the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention\\nand kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse\\nshe understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and\\ntheir temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary\\nvirtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into\\ntheir troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance\\nwith as much intelligence as goodwill  in the present instance\\nit was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit\\nand after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice\\nshe quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene\\nas made her say to harriet as they walked away\\n\\nthese are the sights harriet to do one good  how trifling they\\nmake every thing else appeari feel now as if i could think of\\nnothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet\\nwho can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind\\n\\nvery true said harriet  poor creatures one can think\\nof nothing else\\n\\nand really i do not think the impression will soon be over\\nsaid emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep\\nwhich ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden\\nand brought them into the lane again  i do not think it will\\nstopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place\\nand recall the still greater within\\n\\noh dear no said her companion\\n\\nthey walked on  the lane made a slight bend and when that bend\\nwas passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near\\nas to give emma time only to say farther\\n\\nah  harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability\\nin good thoughts  well smiling i hope it may be allowed that\\nif compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers\\nit has done all that is truly important  if we feel for the wretched\\nenough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy\\nonly distressing to ourselves\\n\\nharriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman\\njoined them  the wants and sufferings of the poor family however\\nwere the first subject on meeting  he had been going to call\\non them  his visit he would now defer but they had a very\\ninteresting parley about what could be done and should be done\\nmr elton then turned back to accompany them\\n\\nto fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma\\nto meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase\\nof love on each side  i should not wonder if it were to bring\\non the declaration  it must if i were not here  i wish i were\\nanywhere else\\n\\nanxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised\\non one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road\\nbut she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriets\\nhabits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that\\nin short they would both be soon after her  this would not do\\nshe immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration\\nto make in the lacing of her halfboot and stooping down in complete\\noccupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on\\nand she would follow in half a minute  they did as they were desired\\nand by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot\\nshe had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken\\nby a child from the cottage setting out according to orders\\nwith her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield  to walk by the side\\nof this child and talk to and question her was the most natural\\nthing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been\\nacting just then without design and by this means the others were\\nstill able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her\\nshe gained on them however involuntarily  the childs pace was quick\\nand theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it\\nfrom their being evidently in a conversation which interested them\\nmr elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very\\npleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning\\nto think how she might draw back a little more when they both\\nlooked around and she was obliged to join them\\n\\nmr elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail\\nand emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he\\nwas only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterdays\\nparty at his friend coles and that she was come in herself for\\nthe stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the cellery\\nthe beetroot and all the dessert\\n\\nthis would soon have led to something better of course was her\\nconsoling reflection any thing interests between those who love\\nand any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart\\nif i could but have kept longer away\\n\\nthey now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage\\npales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into\\nthe house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot\\nand fall behind to arrange it once more  she then broke the lace\\noff short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently\\nobliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to\\nput herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort\\n\\npart of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am\\nto contrive  i really am a most troublesome companion to you both\\nbut i hope i am not often so illequipped mr elton i must beg\\nleave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit\\nof ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on\\n\\nmr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing\\ncould exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into\\nhis house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage\\nthe room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied\\nand looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately\\ncommunicated the door between them was open and emma passed\\ninto it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most\\ncomfortable manner  she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she\\nfound it but she fully intended that mr elton should close it\\nit was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging\\nthe housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it\\npracticable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room\\nfor ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself  it could\\nbe protracted no longer  she was then obliged to be finished\\nand make her appearance\\n\\nthe lovers were standing together at one of the windows  it had a\\nmost favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory\\nof having schemed successfully  but it would not do he had not\\ncome to the point  he had been most agreeable most delightful\\nhe had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely\\nfollowed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt\\nbut nothing serious\\n\\ncautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch\\nand will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure\\n\\nstill however though every thing had not been accomplished\\nby her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself\\nthat it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both\\nand must be leading them forward to the great event\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi\\n\\n\\nmr elton must now be left to himself  it was no longer in emmas\\npower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures\\nthe coming of her sisters family was so very near at hand\\nthat first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth\\nher prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay\\nat hartfield it was not to be expectedshe did not herself expect\\nthat any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could\\nbe afforded by her to the lovers  they might advance rapidly\\nif they would however they must advance somehow or other whether\\nthey would or no  she hardly wished to have more leisure for them\\nthere are people who the more you do for them the less they will\\ndo for themselves\\n\\nmr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual\\nabsent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the\\nusual interest  till this year every long vacation since their\\nmarriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey\\nbut all the holidays of this autumn had been given to seabathing\\nfor the children and it was therefore many months since they had\\nbeen seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all\\nby mr woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london\\neven for poor isabellas sake and who consequently was now most\\nnervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit\\n\\nhe thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a\\nlittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to\\nbring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms\\nwere needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished\\nand mr and mrs john knightley their five children and a competent\\nnumber of nurserymaids all reaching hartfield in safety\\nthe bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to\\nwelcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of\\nproduced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne\\nunder any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this\\nbut the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were\\nso respected by mrs john knightley that in spite of maternal\\nsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones\\nand for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance\\nall the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing\\nwhich they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay\\nthe children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him\\neither in themselves or in any restless attendance on them\\n\\nmrs john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle\\nquiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate\\nwrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother\\nand so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for\\nthese higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible\\nshe could never see a fault in any of them  she was not a woman\\nof strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance\\nof her father she inherited also much of his constitution\\nwas delicate in her own health overcareful of that of her children\\nhad many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr wingfield\\nin town as her father could be of mr perry  they were alike too\\nin a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard\\nfor every old acquaintance\\n\\nmr john knightley was a tall gentlemanlike and very clever man\\nrising in his profession domestic and respectable in his\\nprivate character but with reserved manners which prevented his being\\ngenerally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour\\nhe was not an illtempered man not so often unreasonably cross\\nas to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his\\ngreat perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife\\nit was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not\\nbe increased  the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his\\nhe had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted\\nand he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing\\n\\nhe was not a great favourite with his fair sisterinlaw nothing\\nwrong in him escaped her  she was quick in feeling the little\\ninjuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself\\nperhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been\\nflattering to isabellas sister but they were only those of a calmly\\nkind brother and friend without praise and without blindness\\nbut hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her\\nregardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes\\nfell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father\\nthere he had not always the patience that could have been wished\\nmr woodhouses peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking\\nhim to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally illbestowed\\nit did not often happen for mr john knightley had really a great\\nregard for his fatherinlaw and generally a strong sense of what was\\ndue to him but it was too often for emmas charity especially as\\nthere was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured\\nthough the offence came not  the beginning however of every visit\\ndisplayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity\\nso short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality\\nthey had not been long seated and composed when mr woodhouse\\nwith a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughters\\nattention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last\\n\\nah my dear said he poor miss taylorit is a grievous business\\n\\noh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must\\nmiss her  and dear emma toowhat a dreadful loss to you both\\ni have been so grieved for youi could not imagine how you could\\npossibly do without herit is a sad change indeedbut i hope\\nshe is pretty well sir\\n\\npretty well my deari hopepretty welli do not know\\nbut that the place agrees with her tolerably\\n\\nmr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any\\ndoubts of the air of randalls\\n\\noh nonone in the least  i never saw mrs weston better in my life\\nnever looking so well  papa is only speaking his own regret\\n\\nvery much to the honour of both was the handsome reply\\n\\nand do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella\\nin the plaintive tone which just suited her father\\n\\nmr woodhouse hesitatednot near so often my dear as i could wish\\n\\noh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since\\nthey married  either in the morning or evening of every day\\nexcepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston\\nand generally both either at randalls or hereand as you\\nmay suppose isabella most frequently here  they are very\\nvery kind in their visits  mr weston is really as kind as herself\\npapa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving\\nisabella a false idea of us all  every body must be aware that miss\\ntaylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured\\nthat mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any\\nmeans to the extent we ourselves anticipatedwhich is the exact truth\\n\\njust as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hoped\\nit was from your letters  her wish of shewing you attention could\\nnot be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it\\nall easy  i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea\\nof the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended\\nand now you have emmas account i hope you will be satisfied\\n\\nwhy to be sure said mr woodhouseyes certainlyi cannot deny\\nthat mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often\\nbut thenshe is always obliged to go away again\\n\\nit would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa\\nyou quite forget poor mr weston\\n\\ni think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr weston\\nhas some little claim  you and i emma will venture to take the part\\nof the poor husband  i being a husband and you not being a wife\\nthe claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force\\nas for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience\\nof putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can\\n\\nme my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part\\nare you talking about mei am sure nobody ought to be or can be\\na greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been\\nfor the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought\\nof miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world\\nand as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think\\nthere is nothing he does not deserve  i believe he is one of the\\nvery besttempered men that ever existed  excepting yourself\\nand your brother i do not know his equal for temper  i shall\\nnever forget his flying henrys kite for him that very windy day\\nlast easterand ever since his particular kindness last september\\ntwelvemonth in writing that note at twelve oclock at night\\non purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham\\ni have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor\\na better man in existenceif any body can deserve him it must be\\nmiss taylor\\n\\nwhere is the young man said john knightley  has he been here\\non this occasionor has he not\\n\\nhe has not been here yet replied emma  there was a strong\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended\\nin nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately\\n\\nbut you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father\\nhe wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her\\nand a very proper handsome letter it was  she shewed it to me\\ni thought it very well done of him indeed  whether it was his own idea\\nyou know one cannot tell  he is but young and his uncle perhaps\\n\\nmy dear papa he is threeandtwenty you forget how time passes\\n\\nthreeandtwentyis he indeedwell i could not have thought it\\nand he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother  well\\ntime does fly indeedand my memory is very bad  however it was\\nan exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston\\na great deal of pleasure  i remember it was written from weymouth\\nand dated sept 28thand began my dear madam but i forget\\nhow it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill\\ni remember that perfectly\\n\\nhow very pleasing and proper of him cried the goodhearted mrs john\\nknightley  i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man\\nbut how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father\\nthere is something so shocking in a childs being taken away from his\\nparents and natural home  i never could comprehend how mr weston\\ncould part with him  to give up ones child  i really never\\ncould think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else\\n\\nnobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy\\nobserved mr john knightley coolly  but you need not imagine\\nmr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry\\nor john  mr weston is rather an easy cheerfultempered man\\nthan a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them\\nand makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect\\nmuch more upon what is called society for his comforts that is\\nupon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his\\nneighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any\\nthing that home affords\\n\\nemma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr weston\\nand had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let\\nit pass  she would keep the peace if possible and there was\\nsomething honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits\\nthe allsufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brothers\\ndisposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse\\nand those to whom it was importantit had a high claim to forbearance\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xii\\n\\n\\nmr knightley was to dine with themrather against the inclination\\nof mr woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him\\nin isabellas first day  emmas sense of right however had decided it\\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother\\nshe had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late\\ndisagreement between mr knightley and herself in procuring him\\nthe proper invitation\\n\\nshe hoped they might now become friends again  she thought it\\nwas time to make up  makingup indeed would not do  she certainly\\nhad not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had\\nconcession must be out of the question but it was time to appear\\nto forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather\\nassist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room\\nshe had one of the children with herthe youngest a nice little girl\\nabout eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield\\nand very happy to be danced about in her aunts arms  it did assist\\nfor though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon\\nled on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child\\nout of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity\\nemma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving\\nher at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness\\nshe could not help saying as he was admiring the baby\\n\\nwhat a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces\\nas to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different\\nbut with regard to these children i observe we never disagree\\n\\nif you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men\\nand women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your\\ndealings with them as you are where these children are concerned\\nwe might always think alike\\n\\nto be sureour discordancies must always arise from my being\\nin the wrong\\n\\nyes said he smilingand reason good  i was sixteen years\\nold when you were born\\n\\na material difference then she repliedand no doubt you were\\nmuch my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does\\nnot the lapse of oneandtwenty years bring our understandings\\na good deal nearer\\n\\nyesa good deal nearer\\n\\nbut still not near enough to give me a chance of being right\\nif we think differently\\n\\ni have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by\\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child  come my dear emma\\nlet us be friends and say no more about it  tell your aunt little emma\\nthat she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\\nold grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now\\n\\nthats true she criedvery true  little emma grow up\\na better woman than your aunt  be infinitely cleverer and not\\nhalf so conceited  now mr knightley a word or two more and i\\nhave done  as far as good intentions went we were both right\\nand i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet\\nproved wrong  i only want to know that mr martin is not very\\nvery bitterly disappointed\\n\\na man cannot be more so was his short full answer\\n\\nahindeed i am very sorrycome shake hands with me\\n\\nthis had just taken place and with great cordiality when john\\nknightley made his appearance and how dye do george and john\\nhow are you succeeded in the true english style burying under\\na calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment\\nwhich would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing\\nfor the good of the other\\n\\nthe evening was quiet and conversable as mr woodhouse declined\\ncards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his\\ndear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions\\non one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr knightleys\\ntheir subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixingand emma\\nonly occasionally joining in one or the other\\n\\nthe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally\\nof those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative\\nand who was always the greater talker  as a magistrate he had\\ngenerally some point of law to consult john about or at least\\nsome curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand\\nthe homefarm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear\\nnext year and to give all such local information as could not fail\\nof being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been\\nthe longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong\\nthe plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree\\nand the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn\\nwas entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his\\ncooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever\\nleft him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached\\na tone of eagerness\\n\\nwhile they were thus comfortably occupied mr woodhouse was enjoying\\na full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter\\n\\nmy poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand\\nand interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one\\nof her five childrenhow long it is how terribly long since you\\nwere here  and how tired you must be after your journey  you must\\ngo to bed early my dearand i recommend a little gruel to you\\nbefore you goyou and i will have a nice basin of gruel together\\nmy dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel\\n\\nemma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did\\nthat both the mr knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article\\nas herselfand two basins only were ordered  after a little\\nmore discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its\\nnot being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say\\nwith an air of grave reflection\\n\\nit was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn\\nat south end instead of coming here  i never had much opinion\\nof the sea air\\n\\nmr wingfield most strenuously recommended it siror we\\nshould not have gone  he recommended it for all the children\\nbut particularly for the weakness in little bellas throat\\nboth sea air and bathing\\n\\nah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her\\nany good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced\\nthough perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very\\nrarely of use to any body  i am sure it almost killed me once\\n\\ncome come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject i must\\nbeg you not to talk of the sea  it makes me envious and miserable\\ni who have never seen it  south end is prohibited if you please\\nmy dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about\\nmr perry yet and he never forgets you\\n\\noh good mr perryhow is he sir\\n\\nwhy pretty well but not quite well  poor perry is bilious\\nand he has not time to take care of himselfhe tells me he has\\nnot time to take care of himselfwhich is very sadbut he is\\nalways wanted all round the country  i suppose there is not a man\\nin such practice anywhere  but then there is not so clever a man\\nany where\\n\\nand mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow\\ni have a great regard for mr perry  i hope he will be calling soon\\nhe will be so pleased to see my little ones\\n\\ni hope he will be here tomorrow for i have a question or two to ask\\nhim about myself of some consequence  and my dear whenever he comes\\nyou had better let him look at little bellas throat\\n\\noh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly\\nany uneasiness about it  either bathing has been of the greatest\\nservice to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent\\nembrocation of mr wingfields which we have been applying\\nat times ever since august\\n\\nit is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been\\nof use to herand if i had known you were wanting an embrocation\\ni would have spoken to\\n\\nyou seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates said emma\\ni have not heard one inquiry after them\\n\\noh the good batesesi am quite ashamed of myselfbut you\\nmention them in most of your letters  i hope they are quite well\\ngood old mrs batesi will call upon her tomorrow and take\\nmy childrenthey are always so pleased to see my children\\nand that excellent miss batessuch thorough worthy people\\nhow are they sir\\n\\nwhy pretty well my dear upon the whole  but poor mrs bates\\nhad a bad cold about a month ago\\n\\nhow sorry i am  but colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\nthis autumn  mr wingfield told me that he has never known them\\nmore general or heavyexcept when it has been quite an influenza\\n\\nthat has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree\\nyou mention  perry says that colds have been very general\\nbut not so heavy as he has very often known them in november\\nperry does not call it altogether a sickly season\\n\\nno i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except\\n\\nah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always\\na sickly season  nobody is healthy in london nobody can be\\nit is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off\\nand the air so bad\\n\\nno indeedwe are not at all in a bad air  our part of london is\\nvery superior to most othersyou must not confound us with london\\nin general my dear sir  the neighbourhood of brunswick square\\nis very different from almost all the rest  we are so very airy\\ni should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town\\nthere is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my\\nchildren in  but we are so remarkably airymr wingfield thinks\\nthe vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as\\nto air\\n\\nah my dear it is not like hartfield  you make the best of it\\nbut after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you\\ndifferent creatures you do not look like the same  now i cannot say\\nthat i think you are any of you looking well at present\\n\\ni am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those\\nlittle nervous headaches and palpitations which i am never entirely\\nfree from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were\\nrather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were\\na little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness\\nof coming  i hope you will think better of their looks tomorrow\\nfor i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe\\nhe had ever sent us off altogether in such good case  i trust\\nat least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill\\nturning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband\\n\\nmiddling my dear i cannot compliment you  i think mr john\\nknightley very far from looking well\\n\\nwhat is the matter sirdid you speak to me cried mr john\\nknightley hearing his own name\\n\\ni am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you\\nlooking wellbut i hope it is only from being a little fatigued\\ni could have wished however as you know that you had seen\\nmr wingfield before you left home\\n\\nmy dear isabellaexclaimed he hastilypray do not concern\\nyourself about my looks  be satisfied with doctoring and coddling\\nyourself and the children and let me look as i chuse\\n\\ni did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother\\ncried emma about your friend mr grahams intending to have a bailiff\\nfrom scotland to look after his new estate  what will it answer\\nwill not the old prejudice be too strong\\n\\nand she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced\\nto give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing\\nworse to hear than isabellas kind inquiry after jane fairfax\\nand jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general\\nshe was at that moment very happy to assist in praising\\n\\nthat sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs john knightley\\nit is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment\\naccidentally in town  what happiness it must be to her good old\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them\\ni always regret excessively on dear emmas account that she cannot\\nbe more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose\\ncolonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all\\nshe would be such a delightful companion for emma\\n\\nmr woodhouse agreed to it all but added\\n\\nour little friend harriet smith however is just such another\\npretty kind of young person  you will like harriet  emma could\\nnot have a better companion than harriet\\n\\ni am most happy to hear itbut only jane fairfax one knows to be\\nso very accomplished and superiorand exactly emmas age\\n\\nthis topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of\\nsimilar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening\\ndid not close without a little return of agitation  the gruel came\\nand supplied a great deal to be saidmuch praise and many comments\\nundoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution\\nand pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was\\nnever met with tolerablebut unfortunately among the failures\\nwhich the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore\\nmost prominent was in her own cook at south end a young woman\\nhired for the time who never had been able to understand what she\\nmeant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin\\noften as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able\\nto get any thing tolerable  here was a dangerous opening\\n\\nah said mr woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on\\nher with tender concernthe ejaculation in emmas ear expressed\\nah there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to\\nsouth end  it does not bear talking of  and for a little while\\nshe hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination\\nmight suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel\\nafter an interval of some minutes however he began with\\n\\ni shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn\\ninstead of coming here\\n\\nbut why should you be sorry siri assure you it did the children\\na great deal of good\\n\\nand moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not\\nhave been to south end  south end is an unhealthy place\\nperry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end\\n\\ni know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is\\nquite a mistake sirwe all had our health perfectly well there\\nnever found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield\\nsays it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy\\nand i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands\\nthe nature of the air and his own brother and family have been\\nthere repeatedly\\n\\nyou should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere\\nperry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best\\nof all the seabathing places  a fine open sea he says and very\\npure air  and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there\\nquite away from the seaa quarter of a mile offvery comfortable\\nyou should have consulted perry\\n\\nbut my dear sir the difference of the journeyonly consider how\\ngreat it would have beenan hundred miles perhaps instead of forty\\n\\nah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else\\nshould be considered and if one is to travel there is not much\\nto chuse between forty miles and an hundredbetter not move at all\\nbetter stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get\\ninto a worse air  this is just what perry said  it seemed to him\\na very illjudged measure\\n\\nemmas attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he\\nhad reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her\\nbrotherinlaws breaking out\\n\\nmr perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure\\nwould do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for\\nwhy does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do\\nat my taking my family to one part of the coast or anotheri may\\nbe allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry\\ni want his directions no more than his drugs  he paused\\nand growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness\\nif mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children\\na distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense\\nor inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to\\nprefer cromer to south end as he could himself\\n\\ntrue true cried mr knightley with most ready interposition\\nvery true  thats a consideration indeedbut john as to what i\\nwas telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning\\nit more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows\\ni cannot conceive any difficulty  i should not attempt it\\nif it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people\\nbut if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path   \\nthe only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps\\ni shall see you at the abbey tomorrow morning i hope and then we\\nwill look them over and you shall give me your opinion\\n\\nmr woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on\\nhis friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously\\nbeen attributing many of his own feelings and expressions\\nbut the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed\\nthe present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother\\nand better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiii\\n\\n\\nthere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs john\\nknightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning\\namong her old acquaintance with her five children and talking\\nover what she had done every evening with her father and sister\\nshe had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass\\nso swiftly  it was a delightful visitperfect in being much too short\\n\\nin general their evenings were less engaged with friends than\\ntheir mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out\\nof the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas\\nmr weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls\\none dayeven mr woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible\\nthing in preference to a division of the party\\n\\nhow they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty\\nif he could but as his son and daughters carriage and horses\\nwere actually at hartfield he was not able to make more than\\na simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt\\nnor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one\\nof the carriages find room for harriet also\\n\\nharriet mr elton and mr knightley their own especial set\\nwere the only persons invited to meet themthe hours were to be early\\nas well as the numbers few mr woodhouses habits and inclination\\nbeing consulted in every thing\\n\\nthe evening before this great event for it was a very great event\\nthat mr woodhouse should dine out on the 24th of december had been\\nspent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed\\nwith a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed\\nby mrs goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house\\nemma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed\\nwith regard to randalls  she was very feverish and had a bad\\nsore throat  mrs goddard was full of care and affection mr perry\\nwas talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist\\nthe authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement\\nthough she could not speak of her loss without many tears\\n\\nemma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs goddards\\nunavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much\\nmr eltons would be depressed when he knew her state and left her\\nat last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having\\na most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much\\nshe had not advanced many yards from mrs goddards door when she\\nwas met by mr elton himself evidently coming towards it and as\\nthey walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid\\nof whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going\\nto inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield\\nthey were overtaken by mr john knightley returning from the\\ndaily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy\\nglowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed\\nto ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they\\nwere hastening home for  they joined company and proceeded together\\nemma was just describing the nature of her friends complaint\\na throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her\\na quick low pulse c  and she was sorry to find from mrs goddard\\nthat harriet was liable to very bad sorethroats and had often\\nalarmed her with them  mr elton looked all alarm on the occasion\\nas he exclaimed\\n\\na sorethroati hope not infectious  i hope not of a putrid\\ninfectious sort  has perry seen her  indeed you should take care\\nof yourself as well as of your friend  let me entreat you to run\\nno risks  why does not perry see her\\n\\nemma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this\\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of mrs goddards experience\\nand care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness\\nwhich she could not wish to reason away which she would rather\\nfeed and assist than not she added soon afterwardsas if quite\\nanother subject\\n\\nit is so cold so very coldand looks and feels so very much\\nlike snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party\\ni should really try not to go out todayand dissuade my father\\nfrom venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem\\nto feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it\\nwould be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston  but upon\\nmy word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself\\nyou appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider\\nwhat demand of voice and what fatigues tomorrow will bring\\ni think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home\\nand take care of yourself tonight\\n\\nmr elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make\\nwhich was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind\\ncare of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of\\nhers he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit\\nbut emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions\\nand views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision\\nwas very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its\\nbeing very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in\\nhaving extricated him from randalls and secured him the power\\nof sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening\\n\\nyou do quite right said shewe will make your apologies\\nto mr and mrs weston\\n\\nbut hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly\\noffering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr eltons\\nonly objection and mr elton actually accepting the offer with much\\nprompt satisfaction  it was a done thing mr elton was to go\\nand never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than\\nat this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes\\nmore exulting than when he next looked at her\\n\\nwell said she to herself this is most strangeafter i\\nhad got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave\\nharriet ill behindmost strange indeedbut there is i believe\\nin many men especially single men such an inclination\\nsuch a passion for dining outa dinner engagement is so high in\\nthe class of their pleasures their employments their dignities\\nalmost their duties that any thing gives way to itand this must\\nbe the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young\\nman undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still\\nhe cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked\\nwhat a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet\\nbut will not dine alone for her\\n\\nsoon afterwards mr elton quitted them and she could not but do him\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment\\nin his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his\\nvoice while assuring her that he should call at mrs goddards\\nfor news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared\\nfor the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be\\nable to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself\\noff in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour\\n\\nafter a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley\\nbegan with\\n\\ni never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than\\nmr elton  it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned\\nwith men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies\\nto please every feature works\\n\\nmr eltons manners are not perfect replied emma but where there\\nis a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook\\na great deal  where a man does his best with only moderate powers\\nhe will have the advantage over negligent superiority  there is\\nsuch perfect goodtemper and goodwill in mr elton as one cannot\\nbut value\\n\\nyes said mr john knightley presently with some slyness\\nhe seems to have a great deal of goodwill towards you\\n\\nme she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining\\nme to be mr eltons object\\n\\nsuch an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never\\noccurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now\\n\\nmr elton in love with mewhat an idea\\n\\ni do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether\\nit is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly\\ni think your manners to him encouraging  i speak as a friend\\nemma  you had better look about you and ascertain what you do\\nand what you mean to do\\n\\ni thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken  mr elton\\nand i are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on\\namusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often\\narise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes\\nwhich people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into\\nand not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind\\nand ignorant and in want of counsel  he said no more\\n\\nmr woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit\\nthat in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea\\nof shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually\\nwith his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent\\nconsciousness of the weather than either of the others too full\\nof the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at\\nrandalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it\\nthe cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage\\nwas in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down\\nand the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only\\na milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time\\n\\nemma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour\\nthe preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice\\nof his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least\\nwhich mr john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase\\nand the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in\\nexpressing his discontent\\n\\na man said he must have a

the same\\nnot better\\n\\nmy report from mrs goddards said she presently was not\\nso pleasant as i had hopednot better was my answer\\n\\nhis face lengthened immediately and his voice was the

come\\nwhen you will be paid for all this when you will have little\\nlabour and great enjoyment\\n\\nmy first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through\\nthe sweepgate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiv\\n\\n\\nsome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman\\nas they walked into mrs westons drawingroommr elton must\\ncompose his joyous looks and mr john knightley disperse his\\nillhumour mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more\\nto fit them for the placeemma only might be as nature prompted\\nand shew herself just as happy as she was  to her it was real\\nenjoyment to be with the westons  mr weston was a great favourite\\nand there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with\\nsuch unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related\\nwith such conviction of being listened to and understood of being\\nalways interesting and always intelligible the little affairs\\narrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself\\nshe could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs weston had not\\na lively concern and half an hours uninterrupted communication\\nof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private\\nlife depends was one of the first gratifications of each\\n\\nthis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole days visit might\\nnot afford which certainly did not belong to the present halfhour\\nbut the very sight of mrs weston her smile her touch her voice\\nwas grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as\\npossible of mr eltons oddities or of any thing else unpleasant\\nand enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost\\n\\nthe misfortune of harriets cold had been pretty well gone through\\nbefore her arrival  mr woodhouse had been safely seated long\\nenough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own\\nand isabellas coming and of emmas being to follow and had indeed\\njust got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come\\nand see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs weston\\nwho had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him\\nwas able to turn away and welcome her dear emma\\n\\nemmas project of forgetting mr elton for a while made her rather\\nsorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was\\nclose to her  the difficulty was great of driving his strange\\ninsensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat\\nat her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance\\non her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion\\ninstead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could\\nnot avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother\\nimagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer\\nhis affections from harriet to meabsurd and insufferable\\nyet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be\\nso interested about her father and so delighted with mrs weston\\nand at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal\\nand so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a wouldbe lover\\nand made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners\\nfor her own sake she could not be rude and for harriets in the hope\\nthat all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil\\nbut it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst\\nthe others in the most overpowering period of mr eltons nonsense\\nwhich she particularly wished to listen to  she heard enough\\nto know that mr weston was giving some information about his son\\nshe heard the words my son and frank and my son\\nrepeated several times over and from a few other halfsyllables\\nvery much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from\\nhis son but before she could quiet mr elton the subject was\\nso completely past that any reviving question from her would have\\nbeen awkward\\n\\nnow it so happened that in spite of emmas resolution of never marrying\\nthere was something in the name in the idea of mr frank churchill\\nwhich always interested her  she had frequently thoughtespecially since\\nhis fathers marriage with miss taylorthat if she were to marry\\nhe was the very person to suit her in age character and condition\\nhe seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her\\nshe could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew\\nthem must think of  that mr and mrs weston did think of it she was\\nvery strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him\\nor by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more\\nreplete with good than any she could change it for she had a great\\ncuriosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant\\nof being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure\\nin the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations\\n\\nwith such sensations mr eltons civilities were dreadfully illtimed\\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling\\nvery crossand of thinking that the rest of the visit could not\\npossibly pass without bringing forward the same information again\\nor the substance of it from the openhearted mr westonso it proved\\nfor when happily released from mr elton and seated by mr weston\\nat dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares\\nof hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton\\nto say to her\\n\\nwe want only two more to be just the right number  i should\\nlike to see two more hereyour pretty little friend miss smith\\nand my sonand then i should say we were quite complete\\ni believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawingroom\\nthat we are expecting frank  i had a letter from him this morning\\nand he will be with us within a fortnight\\n\\nemma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented\\nto his proposition of mr frank churchill and miss smith making\\ntheir party quite complete\\n\\nhe has been wanting to come to us continued mr weston\\never since september  every letter has been full of it\\nbut he cannot command his own time  he has those to please\\nwho must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes\\nto be pleased only by a good many sacrifices  but now\\ni have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january\\n\\nwhat a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston\\nis so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost\\nas happy as yourself\\n\\nyes she would be but that she thinks there will be another\\nputoff she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do\\nbut she does not know the parties so well as i do  the case\\nyou see isbut this is quite between ourselves  i did not mention\\na syllable of it in the other room  there are secrets in all families\\nyou knowthe case is that a party of friends are invited to pay\\na visit at enscombe in january and that franks coming depends upon\\ntheir being put off  if they are not put off he cannot stir\\nbut i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady\\nof some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to\\nand though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or\\nthree years they always are put off when it comes to the point\\ni have not the smallest doubt of the issue  i am as confident\\nof seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am\\nof being here myself  but your good friend there nodding\\ntowards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself\\nand has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot\\ncalculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice\\nof doing\\n\\ni am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case\\nreplied emma but am disposed to side with you mr weston  if you\\nthink he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe\\n\\nyesi have some right to that knowledge though i have never been\\nat the place in my lifeshe is an odd womanbut i never allow\\nmyself to speak ill of her on franks account for i do believe\\nher to be very fond of him  i used to think she was not capable\\nof being fond of any body except herself  but she has always been\\nkind to him in her wayallowing for little whims and caprices\\nand expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit\\nin my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection\\nfor though i would not say it to any body else she has no more\\nheart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper\\n\\nemma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs weston\\nvery soon after their moving into the drawingroom wishing her joy\\nyet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming\\nmrs weston agreed to it but added that she should be very\\nglad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting\\nat the time talked of  for i cannot depend upon his coming\\ni cannot be so sanguine as mr weston  i am very much afraid\\nthat it will all end in nothing  mr weston i dare say has been\\ntelling you exactly how the matter stands\\n\\nyesit seems to depend upon nothing but the illhumour\\nof mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain\\nthing in the world\\n\\nmy emma replied mrs weston smiling what is the certainty\\nof caprice  then turning to isabella who had not been\\nattending beforeyou must know my dear mrs knightley\\nthat we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill\\nin my opinion as his father thinks  it depends entirely upon\\nhis aunts spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper\\nto youto my two daughtersi may venture on the truth\\nmrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very oddtempered woman\\nand his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him\\n\\noh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill\\nreplied isabella  and i am sure i never think of that poor young\\nman without the greatest compassion  to be constantly living\\nwith an illtempered person must be dreadful  it is what we\\nhappily have never known any thing of but it must be a life\\nof misery  what a blessing that she never had any children\\npoor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them\\n\\nemma wished she had been alone with mrs weston  she should then have\\nheard more  mrs weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve\\nwhich she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed\\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills\\nfrom her excepting those views on the young man of which her own\\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge\\nbut at present there was nothing more to be said  mr woodhouse\\nvery soon followed them into the drawingroom to be sitting\\nlong after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure\\nneither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did\\nhe move to those with whom he was always comfortable\\n\\nwhile he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity\\nof saying\\n\\nand so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any\\nmeans certain  i am sorry for it  the introduction must be unpleasant\\nwhenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better\\n\\nyes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays\\neven if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still\\nafraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us\\ni cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure\\nthere is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves\\nthere is jealousy  they are jealous even of his regard for his father\\nin short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston\\nwere less sanguine\\n\\nhe ought to come said emma  if he could stay only a couple\\nof days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young mans\\nnot having it in his power to do as much as that  a young woman\\nif she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept at a distance\\nfrom those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young\\nmans being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week\\nwith his father if he likes it\\n\\none ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family\\nbefore one decides upon what he can do replied mrs weston\\none ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the\\nconduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe\\ni believe certainly must not be judged by general rules\\nshe is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her\\n\\nbut she is so fond of the nephew  he is so very great a favourite\\nnow according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural\\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband\\nto whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice\\ntowards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew\\nto whom she owes nothing at all\\n\\nmy dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper\\nto understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it  you must\\nlet it go its own way  i have no doubt of his having at times\\nconsiderable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him\\nto know beforehand when it will be\\n\\nemma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied\\nunless he comes\\n\\nhe may have a great deal of influence on some points\\ncontinued mrs weston and on others very little  and among those\\non which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be\\nthis very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xv\\n\\n\\nmr woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his\\ntea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three\\ncompanions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness\\nof the hour before the other gentlemen appeared  mr weston was\\nchatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort\\nbut at last the drawingroom party did receive an augmentation\\nmr elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in\\nmrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa  he joined\\nthem immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself\\nbetween them\\n\\nemma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind\\nby the expectation of mr frank churchill was willing to forget\\nhis late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before\\nand on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen\\nwith most friendly smiles\\n\\nhe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend\\nher fair lovely amiable friend  did she knowhad she\\nheard any thing about her since their being at randalls\\nhe felt much anxietyhe must confess that the nature of her\\ncomplaint alarmed him considerably  and in this style he talked\\non for some time very properly not much attending to any answer\\nbut altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat\\nand emma was quite in charity with him\\n\\nbut at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if\\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account\\nthan on harrietsmore anxious that she should escape the infection\\nthan that there should be no infection in the complaint  he began\\nwith great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting\\nthe sickchamber again for the presentto entreat her to promise\\nhim not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr perry\\nand learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off\\nand bring the subject back into its proper course there was no\\nputting an end to his extreme solicitude about her  she was vexed\\nit did appearthere was no concealing itexactly like the pretence\\nof being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy\\nif real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty\\nin behaving with temper  he turned to mrs weston to implore\\nher assistance would not she give him her supportwould not she\\nadd her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go\\nto mrs goddards till it were certain that miss smiths disorder\\nhad no infection  he could not be satisfied without a promise\\nwould not she give him her influence in procuring it\\n\\nso scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless\\nfor herself  she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home today\\nand yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated\\nsore throat herself  is this fair mrs westonjudge between us\\nhave not i some right to complain  i am sure of your kind support\\nand aid\\n\\nemma saw mrs westons surprize and felt that it must be great\\nat an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself\\nthe right of first interest in her and as for herself she was\\ntoo much provoked and offended to have the power of directly\\nsaying any thing to the purpose  she could only give him a look\\nbut it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses\\nand then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving\\nher all her attention\\n\\nshe had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidly\\ndid another subject succeed for mr john knightley now came\\ninto the room from examining the weather and opened on them\\nall with the information of the ground being covered with snow\\nand of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind\\nconcluding with these words to mr woodhouse\\n\\nthis will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements\\nsir  something new for your coachman and horses to be making\\ntheir way through a storm of snow\\n\\npoor mr woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else\\nhad something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized\\nand had some question to ask or some comfort to offer  mrs weston\\nand emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention\\nfrom his soninlaw who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly\\n\\ni admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing\\nout in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow\\nvery soon  every body must have seen the snow coming on\\ni admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well\\nanother hour or twos snow can hardly make the road impassable\\nand we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part\\nof the common field there will be the other at hand  i dare say we\\nshall be all safe at hartfield before midnight\\n\\nmr weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he\\nhad known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word\\nlest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse\\nfor his hurrying away  as to there being any quantity of snow fallen\\nor likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke\\nhe was afraid they would find no difficulty  he wished the road might\\nbe impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls\\nand with the utmost goodwill was sure that accommodation might\\nbe found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him\\nthat with a little contrivance every body might be lodged\\nwhich she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there\\nbeing but two spare rooms in the house\\n\\nwhat is to be done my dear emmawhat is to be done\\nwas mr woodhouses first exclamation and all that he could say\\nfor some time  to her he looked for comfort and her assurances\\nof safety her representation of the excellence of the horses\\nand of james and of their having so many friends about them\\nrevived him a little\\n\\nhis eldest daughters alarm was equal to his own  the horror of\\nbeing blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield\\nwas full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just\\npassable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay\\nshe was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain\\nat randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through\\nall the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them\\n\\nyou had better order the carriage directly my love said she\\ni dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly\\nand if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk\\ni am not at all afraid  i should not mind walking half the way\\ni could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not\\nthe sort of thing that gives me cold\\n\\nindeed replied he  then my dear isabella it is the most\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every\\nthing does give you cold  walk homeyou are prettily shod\\nfor walking home i dare say  it will be bad enough for the horses\\n\\nisabella turned to mrs weston for her approbation of the plan\\nmrs weston could only approve  isabella then went to emma\\nbut emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being\\nall able to get away and they were still discussing the point\\nwhen mr knightley who had left the room immediately after his\\nbrothers first report of the snow came back again and told them\\nthat he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there\\nnot being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they\\nliked it either now or an hour hence  he had gone beyond the sweep\\nsome way along the highbury roadthe snow was nowhere above half\\nan inch deepin many places hardly enough to whiten the ground\\na very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting\\nand there was every appearance of its being soon over  he had seen\\nthe coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing\\nto apprehend\\n\\nto isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they\\nwere scarcely less acceptable to emma on her fathers account\\nwho was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\nconstitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not\\nbe appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued\\nat randalls  he was satisfied of there being no present danger in\\nreturning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\\nto stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending\\nmr knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences  thus\\n\\nyour father will not be easy why do not you go\\n\\ni am ready if the others are\\n\\nshall i ring the bell\\n\\nyes do\\n\\nand the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for  a few\\nminutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion\\ndeposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other\\nrecover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over\\n\\nthe carriage came  and mr woodhouse always the first object on\\nsuch occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr knightley\\nand mr weston but not all that either could say could prevent some\\nrenewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen\\nand the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for\\nhe was afraid they should have a very bad drive  he was afraid\\npoor isabella would not like it  and there would be poor emma\\nin the carriage behind  he did not know what they had best do\\nthey must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to\\nand given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage\\n\\nisabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he\\ndid not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally\\nso that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second\\ncarriage by mr elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them\\nand that they were to have a teteatete drive  it would not have been\\nthe awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure\\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked\\nto him of harriet and the threequarters of a mile would have\\nseemed but one  but now she would rather it had not happened\\nshe believed he had been drinking too much of mr westons good wine\\nand felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense\\n\\nto restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity\\nof the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had\\nthey passed the sweepgate and joined the other carriage than she\\nfound her subject cut upher hand seizedher attention demanded\\nand mr elton actually making violent love to her  availing himself\\nof the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already\\nwell known hopingfearingadoringready to die if she refused him\\nbut flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled\\nlove and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect\\nand in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon\\nas possible  it really was so  without scruplewithout apology\\nwithout much apparent diffidence mr elton the lover of harriet\\nwas professing himself her lover  she tried to stop him but vainly\\nhe would go on and say it all  angry as she was the thought of\\nthe moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak\\nshe felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore\\ncould hope that it might belong only to the passing hour\\naccordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she\\nhoped would best suit his half and half state she replied\\n\\ni am very much astonished mr elton  this to me you forget yourself\\nyou take me for my friendany message to miss smith i shall\\nbe happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please\\n\\nmiss smithmessage to miss smithwhat could she possibly mean\\nand he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful\\npretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness\\n\\nmr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account\\nfor it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak\\neither to me or of harriet in such a manner  command yourself\\nenough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it\\n\\nbut mr elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits\\nnot at all to confuse his intellects  he perfectly knew his own meaning\\nand having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious\\nand slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend\\nbut acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned\\nat allhe resumed the subject of his own passion and was very\\nurgent for a favourable answer\\n\\nas she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy\\nand presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied\\n\\nit is impossible for me to doubt any longer  you have made\\nyourself too clear  mr elton my astonishment is much beyond\\nany thing i can express  after such behaviour as i have witnessed\\nduring the last month to miss smithsuch attentions as i\\nhave been in the daily habit of observingto be addressing me\\nin this mannerthis is an unsteadiness of character indeed\\nwhich i had not supposed possible  believe me sir i am far\\nvery far from gratified in being the object of such professions\\n\\ngood heaven cried mr elton what can be the meaning of this\\nmiss smithi never thought of miss smith in the whole course\\nof my existencenever paid her any attentions but as your friend\\nnever cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend\\nif she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her\\nand i am very sorryextremely sorrybut miss smith indeedoh\\nmiss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse\\nis near  no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character\\ni have thought only of you  i protest against having paid the smallest\\nattention to any one else  every

am sure you have seen\\nand understood me\\n\\nit would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing this\\nwhich of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost  she was\\ntoo completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply\\nand two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr eltons\\nsanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he\\njoyously exclaimed\\n\\ncharming

of some sort\\nor other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light\\nand she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken\\nmore in errormore disgraced by misjudgment than she

presumption to me\\nbut poor harriet\\n\\nhow she could have been so deceivedhe protested that he\\nhad never thought seriously of harrietnever  she looked back\\nas well as she could but it was all confusion  she had taken\\nup the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it\\nhis manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious\\nor she could not have been so misled\\n\\nthe picturehow eager he had been about the picture\\nand the charadeand an hundred other circumstances\\nhow clearly they had seemed to point at harriet  to be sure\\nthe charade with its ready witbut then the soft eyes\\nin fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth\\nwho could have seen through such thickheaded nonsense\\n\\ncertainly she had often especially of late thought his manners\\nto herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way\\nas a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof\\namong others that he had not always lived in the best society\\nthat with all the gentleness of his address true elegance\\nwas sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never\\nfor an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect\\nto her as harriets friend\\n\\nto mr john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on\\nthe subject for the first start of its possibility  there was\\nno denying that those brothers had penetration  she remembered\\nwhat mr knightley had once said to her about mr elton the caution\\nhe had given the conviction he had professed that mr elton would\\nnever marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer\\na knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she\\nhad reached herself  it was dreadfully mortifying but mr elton\\nwas proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she\\nhad meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full\\nof his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others\\n\\ncontrary to the usual course of things mr eltons wanting\\nto pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion\\nhis professions and his proposals did him no service  she thought\\nnothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes\\nhe wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his\\neyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy\\nas to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for\\nthere had been no real affection either in his language or manners\\nsighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could\\nhardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice\\nless allied with real love  she need not trouble herself to pity him\\nhe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse\\nof hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite\\nso easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss\\nsomebody else with twenty or with ten\\n\\nbutthat he should talk of encouragement should consider her as\\naware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short\\nto marry himshould suppose himself her equal in connexion\\nor mindlook down upon her friend so well understanding the\\ngradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above\\nas to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her\\nit was most provoking\\n\\nperhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he\\nwas her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind\\nthe very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it\\nbut he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly\\nhis superior  he must know that the woodhouses had been settled\\nfor several generations at hartfield the younger branch\\nof a very ancient familyand that the eltons were nobody\\nthe landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable\\nbeing but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all\\nthe rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources\\nwas such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself\\nin every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long\\nheld a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which\\nmr elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way\\nas he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing\\nto recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility\\nbut he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must\\nhave been his dependence and after raving a little about the\\nseeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head\\nemma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own\\nbehaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of\\ncourtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived\\nmight warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy\\nlike mr elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite  if she\\nhad so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder\\nthat he with selfinterest to blind him should have mistaken hers\\n\\nthe first error and the worst lay at her door  it was foolish\\nit was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two\\npeople together  it was adventuring too far assuming too much\\nmaking light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought\\nto be simple  she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved\\nto do such things no more\\n\\nhere have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being\\nvery much attached to this man  she might never have thought of him\\nbut for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope\\nif i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest\\nand humble as i used to think him  oh that i had been satisfied with\\npersuading her not to accept young martin  there i was quite right\\nthat was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left\\nthe rest to time and chance  i was introducing her into good company\\nand giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having\\ni ought not to have attempted more  but now poor girl her peace\\nis cut up for some time  i have been but half a friend to her\\nand if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am\\nsure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable\\nfor herwilliam coxeoh no i could not endure william coxe\\na pert young lawyer\\n\\nshe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed\\na more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been\\nand might be and must be  the distressing explanation she had\\nto make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering\\nwith the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of\\ncontinuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings\\nconcealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy\\nher in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went\\nto bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having\\nblundered most dreadfully\\n\\nto youth and natural cheerfulness like emmas though under\\ntemporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail\\nto bring return of spirits  the youth and cheerfulness of morning\\nare in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the\\ndistress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they\\nwill be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope\\n\\nemma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had\\ngone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her\\nand to depend on getting tolerably out of it\\n\\nit was a great consolation that mr elton should not be really\\nin love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking\\nto disappoint himthat harriets nature should not be of that\\nsuperior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive\\nand that there could be no necessity for any bodys knowing\\nwhat had passed except the three principals and especially\\nfor her fathers being given a moments uneasiness about it\\n\\nthese were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal\\nof snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was\\nwelcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder\\nat present\\n\\nthe weather was most favourable for her though christmas day\\nshe could not go to church  mr woodhouse would have been miserable\\nhad his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from\\neither exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas\\nthe ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled\\nstate between frost and thaw which is of all others the most\\nunfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow\\nand every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most\\nhonourable prisoner  no intercourse with harriet possible but by note\\nno church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no\\nneed to find excuses for mr eltons absenting himself\\n\\nit was weather which might fairly confine every body at home\\nand though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort\\nin some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father\\nso well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house\\ntoo wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr knightley whom no\\nweather could keep entirely from them\\n\\nah  mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton\\n\\nthese days of confinement would have been but for her private\\nperplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly\\nsuited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance\\nto his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off\\nhis illhumour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him\\nduring the rest of his stay at hartfield  he was always agreeable\\nand obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body  but with all\\nthe hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay\\nthere was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation\\nwith harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvii\\n\\n\\nmr and mrs john knightley were not detained long at hartfield\\nthe weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move\\nand mr woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter\\nto stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole\\nparty set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny\\nof poor isabellawhich poor isabella passing her life with\\nthose she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults\\nand always innocently busy might have been a model of right\\nfeminine happiness\\n\\nthe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note\\nfrom mr elton to mr woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note\\nto say with mr eltons best compliments that he was proposing\\nto leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath\\nwhere in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends\\nhe had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted\\nthe impossibility he was under from various circumstances of\\nweather and business of taking a personal leave of mr woodhouse\\nof whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense\\nand had mr woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them\\n\\nemma was most agreeably surprizedmr eltons absence just\\nat this time was the very thing to be desired  she admired\\nhim for contriving it though not able to give him much credit\\nfor the manner in which it was announced  resentment could not\\nhave been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father\\nfrom which she was so pointedly excluded  she had not even a\\nshare in his opening complimentsher name was not mentioned\\nand there was so striking a change in all this and such an\\nilljudged solemnity of leavetaking in his graceful acknowledgments\\nas she thought at first could not escape her fathers suspicion\\n\\nit did howeverher father was quite taken up with the surprize\\nof so sudden a journey and his fears that mr elton might never get\\nsafely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language\\nit was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter\\nfor thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening\\nmr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits\\nto persuade them away with all her usual promptitude\\n\\nshe now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark  she had\\nreason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was\\ndesirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting\\nthe better of her other complaint before the gentlemans return\\nshe went to mrs goddards accordingly the very next day to undergo\\nthe necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was\\nshe had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously\\nfeedingto appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred\\nand acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and misjudging in all her\\nideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions\\nall her prophecies for the last six weeks\\n\\nthe confession completely renewed her first shameand the sight\\nof harriets tears made her think that she should never be in charity\\nwith herself again\\n\\nharriet bore the intelligence very wellblaming nobody\\nand in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition\\nand lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular\\nadvantage at that moment to her friend\\n\\nemma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost\\nand all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching\\nseemed on harriets side not her own  harriet did not consider\\nherself as having any thing to complain of  the affection of such\\na man as mr elton would have been too great a distinction\\nshe never could have deserved himand nobody but so partial\\nand kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible\\n\\nher tears fell abundantlybut her grief was so truly artless\\nthat no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmas eyes\\nand she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart\\nand understandingreally for the time convinced that harriet was\\nthe superior creature of the twoand that to resemble her would\\nbe more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or\\nintelligence could do\\n\\nit was rather too late in the day to set about being simpleminded\\nand ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution\\nconfirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination\\nall the rest of her life  her second duty now inferior only to her\\nfathers claims was to promote harriets comfort and endeavour\\nto prove her own affection in some better method than by matchmaking\\nshe got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness\\nstriving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation\\nto drive mr elton from her thoughts\\n\\ntime she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she\\ncould suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general\\nand very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr elton\\nin particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriets age\\nand with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be\\nmade towards a state of composure by the time of mr eltons return\\nas to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance\\nwithout any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them\\n\\nharriet did think him all perfection and maintained the nonexistence\\nof any body equal to him in person or goodnessand did in truth\\nprove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen\\nbut yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive\\nagainst an inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not\\ncomprehend its continuing very long in equal force\\n\\nif mr elton on his return made his own indifference as evident\\nand indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do\\nshe could not imagine harriets persisting to place her happiness\\nin the sight or the recollection of him\\n\\ntheir being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad\\nfor each for all three  not one of them had the power of removal\\nor of effecting any material change of society  they must encounter\\neach other and make the best of it\\n\\nharriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at\\nmrs goddards mr elton being the adoration of all the teachers\\nand great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only\\nthat she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling\\nmoderation or repellent truth  where the wound had been given\\nthere must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that\\ntill she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace\\nfor herself\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xviii\\n\\n\\nmr frank churchill did not come  when the time proposed\\ndrew near mrs westons fears were justified in the arrival\\nof a letter of excuse  for the present he could not be spared\\nto his very great mortification and regret but still he looked\\nforward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period\\n\\nmrs weston was exceedingly disappointedmuch more disappointed\\nin fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the\\nyoung man had been so much more sober  but a sanguine temper\\nthough for ever expecting more good than occurs does not\\nalways pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression\\nit soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again\\nfor half an hour mr weston was surprized and sorry but then he\\nbegan to perceive that franks coming two or three months later\\nwould be a much better plan better time of year better weather\\nand that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably\\nlonger with them than if he had come sooner\\n\\nthese feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs weston\\nof a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition\\nof excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband\\nwas to suffer suffered a great deal more herself\\n\\nemma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really\\nabout mr frank churchills not coming except as a disappointment\\nat randalls  the acquaintance at present had no charm for her\\nshe wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it\\nwas desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self\\nshe took care to express as much interest in the circumstance\\nand enter as warmly into mr and mrs westons disappointment\\nas might naturally belong to their friendship\\n\\nshe was the first to announce it to mr knightley and exclaimed\\nquite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps\\nrather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away\\nshe then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the\\nadvantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry\\nthe pleasure of looking at somebody new the galaday to highbury entire\\nwhich the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections\\non the churchills again found herself directly involved in a\\ndisagreement with mr knightley and to her great amusement\\nperceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her\\nreal opinion and making use of mrs westons arguments against herself\\n\\nthe churchills are very likely in fault said mr knightley\\ncoolly but i dare say he might come if he would\\n\\ni do not know why you should say so  he wishes exceedingly to come\\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him\\n\\ni cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made\\na point of it  it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof\\n\\nhow odd you are  what has mr frank churchill done to make you\\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature\\n\\ni am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting\\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care\\nvery little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with\\nthose who have always set him the example of it  it is a great deal\\nmore natural than one could wish that a young man brought up\\nby those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud\\nluxurious and selfish too  if frank churchill had wanted to see\\nhis father he would have contrived it between september and january\\na man at his agewhat is hethree or fourandtwentycannot be\\nwithout the means of doing as much as that  it is impossible\\n\\nthats easily said and easily felt by you who have always\\nbeen your own master  you are the worst judge in the world\\nmr knightley of the difficulties of dependence  you do not know\\nwhat it is to have tempers to manage\\n\\nit is not to be conceived that a man of three or fourandtwenty\\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount  he cannot\\nwant moneyhe cannot want leisure  we know on the contrary\\nthat he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at\\nthe idlest haunts in the kingdom  we hear of him for ever at some\\nwateringplace or other  a little while ago he was at weymouth\\nthis proves that he can leave the churchills\\n\\nyes sometimes he can\\n\\nand those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while\\nwhenever there is any temptation of pleasure\\n\\nit is very unfair to judge of any bodys conduct without an\\nintimate knowledge of their situation  nobody who has not been\\nin the interior of a family can say what the difficulties\\nof any individual of that family may be  we ought to be\\nacquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchills temper\\nbefore we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do\\nhe may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others\\n\\nthere is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses\\nand that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour\\nand resolution  it is frank churchills duty to pay this attention\\nto his father  he knows it to be so by his promises and messages\\nbut if he wished to do it it might be done  a man who felt rightly\\nwould say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill\\nevery sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make\\nto your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately\\ni know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him\\non the present occasion  i shall therefore set off tomorrow\\nif he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming\\na man there would be no opposition made to his going\\n\\nno said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his\\ncoming back again  such language for a young man entirely dependent\\nto usenobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible\\nbut you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly\\nopposite to your own  mr frank churchill to be making such\\na speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up\\nand are to provide for himstanding up in the middle of the room\\ni suppose and speaking as loud as he couldhow can you imagine\\nsuch conduct practicable\\n\\ndepend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it\\nhe would feel himself in the right and the declarationmade\\nof course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner\\nwould do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger\\nwith the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts\\nand expedients can ever do  respect would be added to affection\\nthey would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had\\ndone rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know\\nas well as he does as well as all the world must know that he\\nought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting\\ntheir power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better\\nof him for submitting to their whims  respect for right conduct\\nis felt by every body  if he would act in this sort of manner\\non principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend\\nto his\\n\\ni rather doubt that  you are very fond of bending little minds\\nbut where little minds belong to rich people in authority\\ni think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as\\nunmanageable as great ones  i can imagine that if you as you are\\nmr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in\\nmr frank churchills situation you would be able to say and do\\njust what you have been recommending for him and it might have\\na very good effect  the churchills might not have a word to say\\nin return but then you would have no habits of early obedience\\nand long observance to break through  to him who has it might\\nnot be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence\\nand set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought\\nhe may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have\\nwithout being so equal under particular circumstances to act up\\nto it\\n\\nthen it would not be so strong a sense  if it failed to produce\\nequal exertion it could not be an equal conviction\\n\\noh the difference of situation and habit  i wish you would try\\nto understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel\\nin directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been\\nlooking up to all his life\\n\\nour amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first\\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against\\nthe will of others  it ought to have been a habit with him by\\nthis time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency\\ni can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man\\nas he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off\\nall that was unworthy in their authority  he ought to have opposed\\nthe first attempt on their side to make him slight his father\\nhad he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now\\n\\nwe shall never agree about him cried emma but that is\\nnothing extraordinary  i have not the least idea of his being\\na weak young man  i feel sure that he is not  mr weston would\\nnot be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely\\nto have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit\\nyour notions of mans perfection  i dare say he has and though\\nit may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others\\n\\nyes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move\\nand of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself\\nextremely expert in finding excuses for it  he can sit down and\\nwrite a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods\\nand persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method\\nin the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his fathers\\nhaving any right to complain  his letters disgust me\\n\\nyour feelings are singular  they seem to satisfy every body else\\n\\ni suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston  they hardly can\\nsatisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings  standing in\\na mothers place but without a mothers affection to blind her\\nit is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due\\nand she must doubly feel the omission  had she been a person\\nof consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would\\nnot have signified whether he did or no  can you think your friend\\nbehindhand in these sort of considerations  do you suppose she\\ndoes not often say all this to herself  no emma your amiable\\nyoung man can be amiable only in french not in english  he may be\\nvery aimable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he\\ncan have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people\\nnothing really amiable about him\\n\\nyou seem determined to think ill of him\\n\\nmenot at all replied mr knightley rather displeased i do\\nnot want to think ill of him  i should be as ready to acknowledge\\nhis merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are\\nmerely personal that he is wellgrown and goodlooking with smooth\\nplausible manners\\n\\nwell if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a\\ntreasure at highbury  we do not often look upon fine young men\\nwellbred and agreeable  we must not be nice and ask for all\\nthe virtues into the bargain  cannot you imagine mr knightley\\nwhat a sensation his coming will produce  there will be but one subject\\nthroughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest\\none object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill\\nwe shall think and speak of nobody else\\n\\nyou will excuse my being so much overpowered if i find him\\nconversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only\\na chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts\\n\\nmy idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste\\nof every body and has the power as well as the wish of being\\nuniversally agreeable  to you he will talk of farming to me\\nof drawing or music and so on to every body having that general\\ninformation on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead\\nor take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak\\nextremely well on each that is my idea of him\\n\\nand mine said mr knightley warmly is that if he turn out any\\nthing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing\\nwhat at threeandtwenty to be the king of his companythe great man\\nthe practised politician who is to read every bodys character\\nand make every bodys talents conduce to the display of his\\nown superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he\\nmay make all appear like fools compared with himself  my dear emma\\nyour own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came\\nto the point\\n\\ni will say no more about him cried emma you turn every\\nthing to evil  we are both prejudiced you against i for him\\nand we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here\\n\\nprejudiced  i am not prejudiced\\n\\nbut i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it\\nmy love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in\\nhis favour\\n\\nhe is a person i never think of from one months end to another\\nsaid mr knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma\\nimmediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend\\nwhy he should be angry\\n\\nto take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be\\nof a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real\\nliberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him\\nfor with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid\\nto his charge she had

and\\nin emmas opinion had been talking enough of mr elton for that day\\nshe could not think that harriets solace or her own sins required more\\nand she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject\\nas they returnedbut it burst out again when she thought she\\nhad succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must\\nsuffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive\\nmr elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done\\n\\nthey were just approaching the house where lived mrs and miss bates\\nshe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers\\nthere was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs and\\nmiss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered\\nby the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her\\nas rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she\\nought to the stock of their scanty comforts\\n\\nshe had had many a hint from mr knightley and some from her own heart\\nas to her deficiencybut none were equal to counteract the persuasion\\nof its being very disagreeablea waste of timetiresome women\\nand all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the secondrate\\nand thirdrate of highbury who were calling on them for ever\\nand therefore she seldom went near them  but now she made the sudden\\nresolution of not passing their door without going inobserving\\nas she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate\\nthey were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax\\n\\nthe house belonged to people in business  mrs and miss bates occupied\\nthe drawingroom floor and there in the very moderatesized apartment\\nwhich was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially\\nand even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her\\nknitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up\\nher place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter\\nalmost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for\\ntheir visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after\\nmr woodhouses health cheerful communications about her mothers\\nand sweetcake from the beaufetmrs cole had just been there\\njust called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an\\nhour with them and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind\\nas to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss\\nwoodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too\\n\\nthe mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr elton\\nthere was intimacy between them and mr cole had heard from\\nmr elton since his going away  emma knew what was coming they must\\nhave the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone\\nand how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he\\nwas wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies\\nball had been and she went through it very well with all the\\ninterest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always\\nputting forward to prevent harriets being obliged to say a word\\n\\nthis she had been prepared for when she entered the house\\nbut meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther\\nincommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst\\nall the mistresses and misses of highbury and their cardparties\\nshe had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr elton\\nbut he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away\\nfrom him at last abruptly to the coles to usher in a letter from\\nher niece\\n\\noh yesmr elton i understandcertainly as to dancing\\nmrs cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was\\nmrs cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane\\nfor as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her\\njane is so very great a favourite there  whenever she is with us\\nmrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough\\nand i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can\\nand so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you\\ncannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time\\nfor writing and when i immediately said but indeed we have\\nwe had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw\\nany body more surprized  have you upon your honour said she\\nwell that is quite unexpected  do let me hear what she says\\n\\nemmas politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest\\n\\nhave you heard from miss fairfax so lately  i am extremely happy\\ni hope she is well\\n\\nthank you  you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt\\nwhile eagerly hunting for the letteroh here it is  i was sure\\nit could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see\\nwithout being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand\\nso very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table\\ni was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was\\nreading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her\\na letter from janethat she can never hear it often enough\\nso i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under\\nmy huswifeand since you are so kind as to wish to hear what\\nshe saysbut first of all i really must in justice to jane\\napologise for her writing so short a letteronly two pages you see\\nhardly twoand in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half\\nmy mother often wonders that i can make it out so well\\nshe often says when the letter is first opened well hetty\\nnow i think you will be put to it to make out all that checkerwork\\ndont you maamand then i tell her i am sure she would contrive\\nto make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her\\nevery word of iti am sure she would pore over it till she had\\nmade out every word  and indeed though my mothers eyes are not\\nso good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god\\nwith the help of spectacles  it is such a blessing  my mothers\\nare really very good indeed  jane often says when she is here\\ni am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see\\nas you doand so much fine work as you have done tooi only wish\\nmy eyes may last me as well\\n\\nall this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath\\nand emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss\\nfairfaxs handwriting\\n\\nyou are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified\\nyou who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself\\ni am sure there is nobodys praise that could give us so much pleasure\\nas miss woodhouses my mother does not hear she is a little deaf\\nyou know  maam addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse\\nis so obliging to say about janes handwriting\\n\\nand emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment\\nrepeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it\\nshe was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming\\nvery rude of making her escape from jane fairfaxs letter and had\\nalmost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse\\nwhen miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention\\n\\nmy mothers deafness is very trifling you seejust nothing at all\\nby only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over\\nshe is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice  but it is very\\nremarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me\\njane speaks so distinct  however she will not find her grandmama\\nat all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great\\ndeal at my mothers time of lifeand it really is full two years\\nyou know since she was here  we never were so long without seeing\\nher before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know\\nhow to make enough of her now\\n\\nare you expecting miss fairfax here soon\\n\\noh yes next week\\n\\nindeedthat must be a very great pleasure\\n\\nthank you  you are very kind  yes next week  every body is\\nso surprized and every body says the same obliging things  i am\\nsure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they\\ncan be to see her  yes friday or saturday she cannot say which\\nbecause colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one\\nof those days  so very good of them to send her the whole way\\nbut they always do you know  oh yes friday or saturday next\\nthat is what she writes about  that is the reason of her writing out\\nof rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have\\nheard from her before next tuesday or wednesday\\n\\nyes so i imagined  i was afraid there could be little chance\\nof my hearing any thing of miss fairfax today\\n\\nso obliging of you  no we should not have heard if it had not\\nbeen for this particular circumstance of her being to come here\\nso soon  my mother is so delightedfor she is to be three months\\nwith us at least  three months she says so positively as i\\nam going to have the pleasure of reading to you  the case is\\nyou see that the campbells are going to ireland  mrs dixon has\\npersuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly\\nthey had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so\\nimpatient to see them againfor till she married last october\\nshe was never away from them so much as a week which must make\\nit very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say\\nbut however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter\\nto her motheror her father i declare i do not know which it was\\nbut we shall see presently in janes letterwrote in mr dixons\\nname as well as her own to press their coming over directly\\nand they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back\\nto their country seat balycraig a beautiful place i fancy\\njane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean\\ni do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else\\nbut it was very natural you know that he should like to speak\\nof his own place while he was paying his addressesand as jane used\\nto be very often walking out with themfor colonel and mrs campbell\\nwere very particular about their daughters not walking out\\noften with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them\\nof course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell\\nabout his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word\\nthat he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he\\nhad taken himself  he is a most amiable charming young man\\ni believe  jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account\\nof things\\n\\nat this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering\\nemmas brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr dixon\\nand the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design\\nof farther discovery\\n\\nyou must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed\\nto come to you at such a time  considering the very particular\\nfriendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected\\nher to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell\\n\\nvery true very true indeed  the very thing that we have always\\nbeen rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her\\nat such a distance from us for months togethernot able to come\\nif any thing was to happen  but you see every thing turns out\\nfor the best  they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to\\ncome over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it\\nnothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation\\njane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the\\nleast backward in any attention  he is a most charming young man\\never since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were\\nout in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling\\nround of something or other among the sails would have been dashed\\ninto the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not\\nwith the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit\\ni can never think of it without tremblingbut ever since we\\nhad the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon\\n\\nbut in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish\\nof seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you\\nand mrs bates\\n\\nyesentirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel\\nand mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they\\nshould recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try\\nher native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately\\n\\ni am concerned to hear of it  i think they judge wisely\\nbut mrs dixon must be very much disappointed  mrs dixon\\ni understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not\\nby any means to be compared with miss fairfax\\n\\noh no  you are very obliging to say such thingsbut certainly not\\nthere is no comparison between them  miss campbell always was\\nabsolutely plainbut extremely elegant and amiable\\n\\nyes that of course\\n\\njane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th\\nof november as i am going to read to you and has never been\\nwell since  a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her\\nshe never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us\\njust like her so consideratebut however she is so far from well\\nthat her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home\\nand try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt\\nthat three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her\\nand it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here\\nthan go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we\\nshould do\\n\\nit appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world\\n\\nand so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the\\ncampbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following\\nas you will find from janes letter  so suddenyou may guess\\ndear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in\\nif it was not for the drawback of her illnessbut i am afraid\\nwe must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly\\ni must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that\\ni always make a point of reading janes letters through to myself first\\nbefore i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there\\nbeing any thing in them to distress her  jane desired me to do it\\nso i always do  and so i began today with my usual caution\\nbut no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i\\nburst out quite frightened with bless me poor jane is ill\\nwhich my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly\\nalarmed at  however when i read on i found it was not near so bad\\nas i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her\\nthat she does not think much about it  but i cannot imagine\\nhow i could be so off my guard  if jane does not get well soon\\nwe will call in mr perry  the expense shall not be thought of\\nand though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say\\nhe would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not\\nsuffer it to be so you know  he has a wife and family to maintain\\nand is not to be giving away his time  well now i have just given you\\na hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am\\nsure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it\\nfor her\\n\\ni am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet\\nand beginning to risemy father will be expecting us\\ni had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than\\nfive minutes when i first entered the house  i merely called\\nbecause i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates\\nbut i have been so pleasantly detained  now however we must wish\\nyou and mrs bates good morning\\n\\nand not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded\\nshe regained the streethappy in this that though much had been\\nforced on her against her will though she had in fact heard\\nthe whole substance of jane fairfaxs letter she had been able\\nto escape the letter itself\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii\\n\\n\\njane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs batess\\nyoungest daughter\\n\\nthe marriage of lieut fairfax of the  regiment of infantry\\nand miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure\\nhope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy\\nremembrance of him dying in action abroadof his widow sinking\\nunder consumption and grief soon afterwardsand this girl\\n\\nby birth she belonged to highbury  and when at three years old\\non losing her mother she became the property the charge\\nthe consolation the fondling of her grandmother and aunt there had\\nseemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there\\nof her being taught only what very limited means could command\\nand growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement\\nto be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person\\ngood understanding and warmhearted wellmeaning relations\\n\\nbut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave\\na change to her destiny  this was colonel campbell who had\\nvery highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most\\ndeserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for\\nsuch attentions during a severe campfever as he believed had saved\\nhis life  these were claims which he did not learn to overlook\\nthough some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax\\nbefore his own return to england put any thing in his power\\nwhen he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her\\nhe was a married man with only one living child a girl\\nabout janes age  and jane became their guest paying them long visits\\nand growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old\\nhis daughters great fondness for her and his own wish of being\\na real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell\\nof undertaking the whole charge of her education  it was accepted\\nand from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbells family\\nand had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother\\nfrom time to time\\n\\nthe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others\\nthe very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father\\nmaking independence impossible  to provide for her otherwise\\nwas out of colonel campbells power for though his income by pay\\nand appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must\\nbe all his daughters but by giving her an education he hoped\\nto be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter\\n\\nsuch was jane fairfaxs history  she had fallen into good hands\\nknown nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given\\nan excellent education  living constantly with rightminded\\nand wellinformed people her heart and understanding had received\\nevery advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbells\\nresidence being in london every lighter talent had been done\\nfull justice to by the attendance of firstrate masters\\nher disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that\\nfriendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far\\nas such an early age can be qualified for the care of children\\nfully competent to the office of instruction herself but she\\nwas too much beloved to be parted with  neither father nor mother\\ncould promote and the daughter could not endure it  the evil day\\nwas put off  it was easy to decide that she was still too young\\nand jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all\\nthe rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious\\nmixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future\\nthe sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind\\nher that all this might soon be over\\n\\nthe affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss\\ncampbell in particular was the more honourable to each party\\nfrom the circumstance of janes decided superiority both in beauty\\nand acquirements  that nature had given it in feature could not\\nbe unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind\\nbe unfelt by the parents  they continued together with unabated\\nregard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance\\nthat luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs\\ngiving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior\\nengaged the affections of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeable\\nalmost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly\\nand happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn\\n\\nthis event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be\\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\\nof duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment\\nhad fixed on for beginning  she had long resolved that oneandtwenty\\nshould be the period  with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate\\nshe had resolved at oneandtwenty to complete the sacrifice\\nand retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse\\nequal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever\\n\\nthe good sense of colonel and mrs campbell could not oppose such\\na resolution though their feelings did  as long as they lived\\nno exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever\\nand for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly\\nbut this would be selfishnesswhat must be at last had better\\nbe soon  perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder\\nand wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared\\nher from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must\\nnow be relinquished  still however affection was glad to catch\\nat any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment\\nshe had never been quite well since the time of their daughters marriage\\nand till she should have completely recovered her usual strength\\nthey must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being\\ncompatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed\\nunder the most favourable circumstances to require something\\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\\ntolerable comfort\\n\\nwith regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account\\nto her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some\\ntruths not told  it was her own choice to give the time of their\\nabsence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect\\nliberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear\\nand the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives\\nwhether single or double or treble gave the arrangement\\ntheir ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few\\nmonths spent in her native air for the recovery of her health\\nthan on any thing else  certain it was that she was to come\\nand that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\\nhad been so long promised itmr frank churchillmust put up for\\nthe present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness\\nof a two years absence\\n\\nemma was sorryto have to pay civilities to a person she did\\nnot like through three long monthsto be always doing more than\\nshe wished and less than she ought  why she did not like jane\\nfairfax might be a difficult question to answer mr knightley\\nhad once told her it was because she saw in her the really\\naccomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself\\nand though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time\\nthere were moments of selfexamination in which her conscience could\\nnot quite acquit her  but she could never get acquainted with her\\nshe did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve\\nsuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or notand then\\nher aunt was such an eternal talkerand she was made such a fuss\\nwith by every bodyand it had been always imagined that they were\\nto be so intimatebecause their ages were the same every body had\\nsupposed they must be so fond of each other  these were her reasons\\nshe had no better\\n\\nit was a dislike so little justevery imputed fault was so magnified\\nby fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any\\nconsiderable absence without feeling that she had injured her\\nand now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years\\ninterval she was particularly struck with the very appearance\\nand manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating\\njane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had\\nherself the highest value for elegance  her height was pretty\\njust such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could\\nthink very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most\\nbecoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance\\nof illhealth seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two\\nemma could not but feel all this and then her faceher features\\nthere was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered\\nit was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty  her eyes\\na deep grey with dark eyelashes and eyebrows had never been denied\\ntheir praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at\\nas wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed\\nno fuller bloom  it was a style of beauty of which elegance\\nwas the reigning character and as such she must in honour\\nby all her principles admire itelegance which whether of person\\nor of mind she saw so little in highbury  there not to be vulgar\\nwas distinction and merit\\n\\nin short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax\\nwith twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense\\nof rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike\\nher no longer  when she took in her history indeed her situation\\nas well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance\\nwas destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going\\nto live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion\\nand respect especially if to every wellknown particular entitling\\nher to interest were added the highly probable circumstance\\nof an attachment to mr dixon which she had so naturally started\\nto herself  in that case nothing could be more pitiable\\nor more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on\\nemma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced\\nmr dixons actions from his wife or of any thing mischievous\\nwhich her imagination had suggested at first  if it were love\\nit might be simple single successless love on her side alone\\nshe might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison\\nwhile a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best\\nthe purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit\\nto ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from\\nhim and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty\\n\\nupon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings\\nas made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence\\nnobody that she could wish to scheme about for her\\n\\nthese were charming feelingsbut not lasting  before she had\\ncommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\\njane fairfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices\\nand errors than saying to mr knightley she certainly is handsome\\nshe is better than handsome  jane had spent an evening at hartfield\\nwith her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much\\ninto its usual state  former provocations reappeared  the aunt\\nwas as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her\\nhealth was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to\\nlisten to the description of exactly how little bread and butter\\nshe ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner\\nas well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her\\nmother and herself and janes offences rose again  they had music\\nemma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily\\nfollowed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air\\nof greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\\nsuperior performance  she was besides which was the worst of all\\nso cold so cautious  there was no getting at her real opinion\\nwrapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined\\nto hazard nothing  she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved\\n\\nif any thing could be more where all was most she was more\\nreserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing\\nshe seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr dixons character\\nor her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness\\nof the match  it was all general approbation and smoothness\\nnothing delineated or distinguished  it did her no service however\\nher caution was thrown away  emma saw its artifice and returned\\nto her first surmises  there probably was something more to conceal\\nthan her own preference mr dixon perhaps had been very near\\nchanging one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell\\nfor the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds\\n\\nthe like reserve prevailed on other topics  she and mr frank churchill\\nhad been at weymouth at the same time  it was known that they were\\na little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could emma\\nprocure as to what he truly was  was he handsomeshe believed\\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man  was he agreeable\\nhe was generally thought so  did he appear a sensible young man\\na young man of informationat a wateringplace or in a common\\nlondon acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points\\nmanners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer\\nknowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill  she believed\\nevery body found his manners pleasing  emma could not forgive her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii\\n\\n\\nemma could not forgive herbut as neither provocation nor resentment\\nwere discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side\\nhe was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on\\nbusiness with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so\\nopenly as he might have done had her father been out of the room\\nbut speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma\\nhe had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great\\npleasure in marking an improvement\\n\\na very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr woodhouse\\nhad been talked into what was necessary told that he understood\\nand the papers swept awayparticularly pleasant  you and miss\\nfairfax gave us some very good music  i do not know a more\\nluxurious state sir than sitting at ones ease to be entertained\\na whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music\\nand sometimes with conversation  i am sure miss fairfax must\\nhave found the evening pleasant emma  you left nothing undone\\ni was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument\\nat her grandmothers it must have been a real indulgence\\n\\ni am happy you approved said emma smiling but i hope i am\\nnot often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield\\n\\nno my dear said her father instantly that i am sure you\\nare not  there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are\\nif any thing you are too attentive  the muffin last nightif it\\nhad been handed round once i think it would have been enough\\n\\nno said mr knightley nearly at the same time you are not\\noften deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension\\ni think you understand me therefore\\n\\nan arch look expressedi understand you well enough but she\\nsaid only miss fairfax is reserved\\n\\ni always told you she wasa little but you will soon overcome\\nall that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that\\nhas its foundation in diffidence  what arises from discretion\\nmust be honoured\\n\\nyou think her diffident  i do not see it\\n\\nmy dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close\\nby her you are not going to tell me i hope that you\\nhad not a pleasant evening\\n\\noh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions\\nand amused to think how little information i obtained\\n\\ni am disappointed was his only answer\\n\\ni hope every body had a pleasant evening said mr woodhouse\\nin his quiet way  i had  once i felt the fire rather too much\\nbut then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did\\nnot disturb me  miss bates was very chatty and goodhumoured\\nas she always is though she speaks rather too quick  however\\nshe is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way\\ni like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of\\nyoung lady a very pretty and a very wellbehaved young lady indeed\\nshe must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she\\nhad emma\\n\\ntrue sir and emma because she had miss fairfax\\n\\nemma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for\\nthe present said and with a sincerity which no one could question\\n\\nshe is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep ones eyes from\\ni am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart\\n\\nmr knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared\\nto express and before he could make any reply mr woodhouse\\nwhose thoughts were on the batess said\\n\\nit is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined\\na great pity indeed and i have often wishedbut it is so little one\\ncan venture to dosmall trifling presents of any thing uncommon\\nnow we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them\\na loin or a leg it is very small and delicatehartfield pork is\\nnot like any other porkbut still it is porkand my dear emma\\nunless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried\\nas ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it\\nfor no stomach can bear roast porki think we had better send the leg\\ndo not you think so my dear\\n\\nmy dear papa i sent the whole hindquarter i knew you would wish it\\nthere will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice\\nand the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like\\n\\nthats right my dear very right  i had not thought of it before\\nbut that is the best way  they must not oversalt the leg and then\\nif it is not oversalted and if it is very thoroughly boiled\\njust as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a\\nboiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider\\nit unwholesome\\n\\nemma said mr knightley presently i have a piece of news for you\\nyou like newsand i heard an article in my way hither that i think\\nwill interest you\\n\\nnews  oh yes i always like news  what is itwhy do you\\nsmile sowhere did you hear itat randalls\\n\\nhe had time only to say\\n\\nno not at randalls i have not been near randalls when the door\\nwas thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room\\nfull of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to\\ngive quickest  mr knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment\\nand that not another syllable of communication could rest with him\\n\\noh my dear sir how are you this morning  my dear miss woodhouse\\ni come quite overpowered such a beautiful hindquarter of pork\\nyou are too bountiful  have you heard the news  mr elton is going\\nto be married\\n\\nemma had not had time even to think of mr elton and she was\\nso completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start\\nand a little blush at the sound\\n\\nthere is my newsi thought it would interest you\\nsaid mr knightley with a smile which implied a conviction\\nof some part of what had passed between them\\n\\nbut where could you hear it cried miss bates  where could\\nyou possibly hear it mr knightley  for it is not five minutes\\nsince i received mrs coles noteno it cannot be more than five\\nor at least tenfor i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready\\nto come outi was only gone down to speak to patty again about\\nthe porkjane

i think you have a little cold\\nand patty has been washing the kitchenoh my dear\\nsaid iwell and just then came the note  a miss hawkins\\nthats all i know  a miss hawkins of bath  but mr knightley\\nhow could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole\\ntold mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me  a miss hawkins\\n\\ni was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago\\nhe had just read eltons letter as i was shewn in and handed it\\nto me directly\\n\\nwell that is quitei suppose there never was a piece of news more\\ngenerally interesting  my dear sir you really are too bountiful\\nmy mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a\\nthousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her\\n\\nwe consider our hartfield pork replied mr woodhouseindeed it\\ncertainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i\\ncannot have a greater pleasure than\\n\\noh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good\\nto us  if ever there were people who without having great wealth\\nthemselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us\\nwe may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage\\nwell mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well\\n\\nit was shortmerely to announcebut cheerful exulting of course\\nhere was a sly glance at emma  he had been so fortunate as to\\ni forget the precise wordsone has no business to remember them\\nthe information was as you state that he was going to be married\\nto a miss hawkins  by his style i should imagine it just settled\\n\\nmr elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak\\nhe will have every bodys wishes for his happiness\\n\\nhe is very young to settle was mr woodhouses observation\\nhe had better not be in a hurry  he seemed to me very well off\\nas he was  we were always glad to see him at hartfield\\n\\na new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates\\njoyfully my mother is so pleasedshe says she cannot\\nbear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress\\nthis is great news indeed  jane you have never seen\\nmr eltonno wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him\\n\\njanes curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly\\nto occupy her\\n\\nnoi have never seen mr elton she replied starting on this appeal\\nis heis he a tall man\\n\\nwho shall answer that question cried emma  my father would\\nsay yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is\\njust the happy medium  when you have been here a little longer\\nmiss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard\\nof perfection in highbury both in person and mind\\n\\nvery true miss woodhouse so she will  he is the very best\\nyoung manbut my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday\\nhe was precisely the height of mr perry  miss hawkinsi dare say\\nan excellent young woman  his extreme attention to my mother\\nwanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better\\nfor my mother is a little deaf you knowit is not much but she\\ndoes not hear quite quick  jane says that colonel campbell is a\\nlittle deaf  he fancied bathing might be good for itthe warm bath\\nbut she says it did him no lasting benefit  colonel campbell\\nyou know is quite our angel  and mr dixon seems a very charming\\nyoung man quite worthy of him  it is such a happiness when good\\npeople get togetherand they always do  now here will be mr elton\\nand miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people\\nand the perrysi suppose there never was a happier or a better couple\\nthan mr and mrs perry  i say sir turning to mr woodhouse\\ni think there are few places with such society as highbury\\ni always say we are quite blessed in our neighboursmy dear sir\\nif there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork\\na roast loin of pork\\n\\nas to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been\\nacquainted with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known\\none feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance  he has been\\ngone only four weeks\\n\\nnobody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings\\nemma said\\n\\nyou are silent miss fairfaxbut i hope you mean to take\\nan interest in this news  you who have been hearing and seeing\\nso much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep\\nin the business on miss campbells accountwe shall not excuse\\nyour being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins\\n\\nwhen i have seen mr elton replied jane i dare say i\\nshall be interestedbut i believe it requires that with me\\nand as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression\\nmay be a little worn off\\n\\nyes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse\\nsaid miss bates four weeks yesterdaya miss hawkinswell i had\\nalways rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts\\nnot that i evermrs cole once whispered to mebut i immediately said\\nno mr elton is a most worthy young manbutin short i do\\nnot think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries\\ni do not pretend to it  what is before me i see  at the same time\\nnobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspiredmiss woodhouse\\nlets me chatter on so goodhumouredly she knows i would not\\noffend for the world  how does miss smith do  she seems quite\\nrecovered now  have you heard from mrs john knightley lately\\noh those dear little children  jane do you know i always fancy\\nmr dixon like mr john knightley  i mean in persontall and with\\nthat sort of lookand not very talkative\\n\\nquite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all\\n\\nvery odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand\\none takes up a notion and runs away with it  mr dixon you say\\nis not strictly speaking handsome\\n\\nhandsome  oh nofar from itcertainly plain  i told you he\\nwas plain\\n\\nmy dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain\\nand that you yourself\\n\\noh as for me my judgment is worth nothing  where i have a regard\\ni always think a person welllooking but i gave what i believed\\nthe general opinion when i called him plain\\n\\nwell my dear jane i believe we must be running away\\nthe weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy\\nyou are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must\\ntake leave  this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed\\ni shall just go round by mrs coles but i shall not stop three minutes\\nand jane you had better go home directlyi would not have you\\nout in a showerwe think she is the better for highbury already\\nthank you we do indeed  i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard\\nfor i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork\\nwhen we dress the leg it will be another thing  good morning to you\\nmy dear sir  oh  mr knightley is coming too  well that is\\nso veryi am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to\\ngive her your armmr elton and miss hawkinsgood morning\\nto you\\n\\nemma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him\\nwhile he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry\\nand to marry strangers tooand the other half she could give\\nto her own view of the subject  it was to herself an amusing\\nand a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr elton\\ncould not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet\\nharriet must feel itand all that she could hope was by giving\\nthe first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly\\nfrom others  it was now about the time that she was likely to call\\nif she were to meet miss bates in her wayand upon its beginning\\nto rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\\ndetaining her at mrs goddards and that the intelligence would\\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation\\n\\nthe shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes\\nwhen in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which\\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the\\noh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly\\nburst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation\\nas the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater\\nkindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly\\nthrough what she had to tell  she had set out from mrs goddards\\nhalf an hour agoshe had been afraid it would rainshe had been\\nafraid it would pour down every momentbut she thought she might\\nget to hartfield firstshe had hurried on as fast as possible\\nbut then as she was passing by the house where a young woman\\nwas making up a gown for her she thought she would just step\\nin and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay\\nhalf a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain\\nand she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast\\nas she could and took shelter at fordsfords was the principal\\nwoollendraper linendraper and haberdashers shop united\\nthe shop first in size and fashion in the placeand so\\nthere she had set without an idea of any thing in the world\\nfull ten minutes perhapswhen all of a sudden who should come in\\nto be sure it was so very oddbut they always dealt at fords\\nwho should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother\\ndear miss woodhouse only think  i thought i should have fainted\\ni did not know what to do  i was sitting near the doorelizabeth saw\\nme directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella\\ni am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took\\nno notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop\\nand i kept sitting near the dooroh dear i was so miserable\\ni am sure i must have been as white as my gown  i could not go away\\nyou know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere\\nin the world but thereoh dear miss woodhousewell at last\\ni fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going\\non with her buyings they began whispering to one another\\ni am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking\\nthat he was persuading her to speak to medo you think he was\\nmiss woodhousefor presently she came forwardcame quite up\\nto me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands\\nif i would  she did not do any of it in the same way that she used\\ni could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be\\nvery friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time\\nbut i know no more what i saidi was in such a tremblei remember\\nshe said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost\\ntoo kind  dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable\\nby that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined\\nthat nothing should stop me from getting awayand thenonly think\\ni found he was coming up towards me tooslowly you know and as\\nif he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke\\nand i answeredand i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully\\nyou know one cant tell how and then i took courage and said it\\ndid not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got\\nthree yards from the door when he came after me only to say\\nif i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round\\nby mr coles stables for i should find the near way quite floated\\nby this rain  oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me\\nso i said i was very much obliged to him  you know i could\\nnot do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round\\nby the stablesi believe i didbut i hardly knew where i was\\nor any thing about it  oh  miss woodhouse i would rather done\\nany thing than have it happen  and yet you know there was a sort\\nof satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly\\nand elizabeth too  oh  miss woodhouse do talk to me and make\\nme comfortable again\\n\\nvery sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in\\nher power  she was obliged to stop and think  she was not thoroughly\\ncomfortable herself  the young mans conduct and his sisters\\nseemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them\\nas harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture\\nof wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour\\nbut she had believed them to be wellmeaning worthy people before\\nand what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion\\nit was folly to be disturbed by it  of course he must be sorry\\nto lose herthey must be all sorry  ambition as well as love\\nhad probably been mortified  they might all have hoped to rise\\nby harriets acquaintance  and besides what was the value of\\nharriets descriptionso easily pleasedso little discerning\\nwhat signified her praise\\n\\nshe exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable\\nby considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite\\nunworthy of being dwelt on\\n\\nit might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem\\nto have behaved extremely well and it is overand may never\\ncan never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need\\nnot think about it\\n\\nharriet said very true and she would not think about it\\nbut still she talked of itstill she could talk of nothing else\\nand emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head\\nwas obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give\\nwith so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether\\nto rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state\\nof mind in poor harrietsuch a conclusion of mr eltons importance\\nwith her\\n\\nmr eltons rights however gradually revived  though she did not\\nfeel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before\\nor an hour before its interest soon increased and before their\\nfirst conversation was over she had talked herself into all the\\nsensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure\\nas to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place\\nthe martins under proper subordination in her fancy\\n\\nemma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting\\nit had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining\\nany influence to alarm  as harriet now lived the martins could\\nnot get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted\\neither the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her\\nrefusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs goddards\\nand a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again\\nwith any necessity or even any power of speech\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv\\n\\n\\nhuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in\\ninteresting situations that a young person who either marries\\nor dies is sure of being kindly spoken of\\n\\na week had not passed since miss hawkinss name was first\\nmentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other\\ndiscovered to have every recommendation of person and mind\\nto be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable\\nand when mr elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects\\nand circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more\\nfor him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose\\nmusic she principally played\\n\\nmr elton returned a very happy man  he had gone away rejected\\nand mortifieddisappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series\\nof what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing\\nthe right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very\\nwrong one  he had gone away deeply offendedhe came back engaged\\nto anotherand to another as superior of course to the first\\nas under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost\\nhe came back gay and selfsatisfied eager and busy caring nothing\\nfor miss woodhouse and defying miss smith\\n\\nthe charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages\\nof perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune\\nof so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of\\nsome dignity as well as some convenience  the story told well\\nhe had not thrown himself awayhe had gained a woman of 10000 l\\nor thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity\\nthe first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by\\ndistinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs cole\\nof the rise and progress of the affair was so gloriousthe steps\\nso quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr greens\\nand the party at mrs brownssmiles and blushes rising in importance\\nwith consciousness and agitation richly scatteredthe lady\\nhad been so easily impressedso sweetly disposedhad in short\\nto use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him\\nthat vanity and prudence were equally contented\\n\\nhe had caught both substance and shadowboth fortune and affection\\nand was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself\\nand his own concernsexpecting to be congratulatedready to be\\nlaughed atand with cordial fearless smiles now addressing\\nall the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago\\nhe would have been more cautiously gallant\\n\\nthe wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves\\nto please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for\\nand when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation\\nwhich a certain glance of mrs coles did not seem to contradict\\nthat when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride\\n\\nduring his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just\\nenough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her\\nthe impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique\\nand pretension now spread over his air  she was in fact\\nbeginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing\\nat all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very\\ndisagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance\\na lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind\\nshe would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again\\nshe wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare\\ntwenty miles off would administer most satisfaction\\n\\nthe pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly\\nbe lessened by his marriage  many vain solicitudes would be prevented\\nmany awkwardnesses smoothed by it  a mrs elton would be an excuse for\\nany change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark\\nit would be almost beginning their life of civility again\\n\\nof the lady individually emma thought very little  she was good\\nenough for mr elton no doubt accomplished enough for highbury\\nhandsome enoughto look plain probably by harriets side\\nas to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded\\nthat after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet\\nhe had done nothing  on that article truth seemed attainable\\nwhat she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out\\nand setting aside the 10000 l it did not appear that she was at\\nall harriets superior  she brought no name no blood no alliance\\nmiss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol\\nmerchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the\\nprofits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was\\nnot unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\\nmoderate also  part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath\\nbut bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though\\nthe father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained\\nin the law linenothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded\\nof him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter\\nhad lived  emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney\\nand too stupid to rise  and all the grandeur of the connexion\\nseemed dependent on the elder sister who was very well married\\nto a gentleman in a great way near bristol who kept two carriages\\nthat was the windup of the history that was the glory of\\nmiss hawkins\\n\\ncould she but have given harriet her feelings about it all\\nshe had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be\\ntalked out of it  the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies\\nof harriets mind was not to be talked away  he might be superseded\\nby another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer\\neven a robert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else\\nshe feared would cure her  harriet was one of those who\\nhaving once begun would be always in love  and now poor girl\\nshe was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr elton\\nshe was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other  emma saw\\nhim only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure\\njust to meet with him or just to miss him just to hear his voice\\nor see his shoulder just to have something occur to preserve him\\nin her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture\\nshe was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when\\nat hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr elton\\nand found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns\\nand every report therefore every guessall that had already\\noccurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs\\ncomprehending income servants and furniture was continually\\nin agitation around her  her regard was receiving strength by\\ninvariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings\\nirritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkinss happiness\\nand continual observation of how much he seemed attached\\nhis air as he walked by the housethe very sitting of his hat\\nbeing all in proof of how much he was in love\\n\\nhad it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain\\nto her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of\\nharriets mind emma would have been amused by its variations\\nsometimes mr elton predominated sometimes the martins and each\\nwas occasionally useful as a check to the other  mr eltons\\nengagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr martin\\nthe unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been\\na little put aside by elizabeth martins calling at mrs goddards\\na few days afterwards  harriet had not been at home but a note had\\nbeen prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch\\na small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness\\nand till mr elton himself appeared she had been much occupied\\nby it continually pondering over what could be done in return\\nand wishing to do more than she dared to confess  but mr elton\\nin person had driven away all such cares  while he staid\\nthe martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off\\nfor bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned\\njudged it best for her to return elizabeth martins visit\\n\\nhow that visit was to be acknowledgedwhat would be necessary\\nand what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful\\nconsideration  absolute neglect of the mother and sisters\\nwhen invited to come would be ingratitude  it must not be\\nand yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance\\n\\nafter much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harriets\\nreturning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding\\nshould convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance\\nshe meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill\\nwhile she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon\\nas to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\\nrecurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what\\ndegree of intimacy was chosen for the future\\n\\nshe could think of nothing better  and though there was something\\nin it which her own heart could not approvesomething of ingratitude\\nmerely glossed overit must be done or what would become of harriet\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v\\n\\n\\nsmall heart had harriet for visiting  only half an hour before her\\nfriend called for her at mrs goddards her evil stars had led\\nher to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to\\nthe rev philip elton whitehart bath was to be seen under the\\noperation of being lifted into the butchers cart which was to\\nconvey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world\\nexcepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank\\n\\nshe went however and when they reached the farm and she was to\\nbe put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led\\nbetween espalier appletrees to the front door the sight of every\\nthing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before\\nwas beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted\\nemma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity\\nwhich determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed\\nquarter of an hour  she went on herself to give that portion\\nof time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell\\n\\nthe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again\\nand miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay\\nand unattended by any alarming young man  she came solitarily\\ndown the gravel walka miss martin just appearing at the door\\nand parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility\\n\\nharriet could not very soon give an intelligible account\\nshe was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her\\nenough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it\\nwas creating  she had seen only mrs martin and the two girls\\nthey had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing\\nbeyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time\\ntill just at last when mrs martins saying all of a sudden\\nthat she thought miss smith was grown had brought on a more\\ninteresting subject and a warmer manner  in that very room\\nshe had been measured last september with her two friends\\nthere were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by\\nthe window  he had done it  they all seemed to remember the day\\nthe hour the party the occasionto feel the same consciousness\\nthe same regretsto be ready to return to the same good understanding\\nand they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma\\nmust suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy\\nwhen the carriage reappeared and all was over  the style of\\nthe visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive\\nfourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully\\npassed six weeks not six months agoemma could not but picture\\nit all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally\\nharriet must suffer  it was a bad business  she would have given\\na great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins\\nin a higher rank of life  they were so deserving that a little\\nhigher should have been enough  but as it was how could she have\\ndone otherwiseimpossibleshe could not repent  they must\\nbe separated but there was a great deal of pain in the process\\nso much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity\\nof a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls\\nto procure it  her mind was quite sick of mr elton and the martins\\nthe refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary\\n\\nit was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard\\nthat neither master nor mistress was at home they had both\\nbeen out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield\\n\\nthis is too bad cried emma as they turned away  and now we\\nshall just miss them too provokingi do not know when i have been\\nso disappointed  and she leaned back in the corner to indulge\\nher murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both\\nsuch being the commonest process of a not illdisposed mind\\npresently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt\\nby mr and mrs weston who were standing to speak to her\\nthere was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater\\npleasure was conveyed in soundfor mr weston immediately accosted\\nher with\\n\\nhow dye dohow dye dowe have been sitting with your father\\nglad to see him so well  frank comes

every thing has turned out exactly\\nas we could wish\\n\\nthere was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the\\ninfluence of such a happy face as mr westons confirmed as it all\\nwas by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter\\nbut not less to the purpose  to know that she thought his coming\\ncertain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did\\nshe rejoice in their joy  it was a most delightful reanimation\\nof exhausted spirits  the wornout past was sunk in the freshness\\nof what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moments thought\\nshe hoped mr elton would now be talked of no more\\n\\nmr weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe\\nwhich allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at\\nhis command as well as the route and the method of his journey\\nand she listened and smiled and congratulated\\n\\ni shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion\\n\\nemma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech\\nfrom his wife\\n\\nwe had better move on mr weston said she we are detaining\\nthe girls\\n\\nwell well i am readyand turning again to emma but you must\\nnot be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my\\naccount you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary\\nthough his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a

through bath as well as oxford\\nwas a question however which did not augur much\\n\\nbut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once\\nand emma was now in a humour to resolve that they

his time and her father was yet\\nin the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when\\nshe appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure\\n\\nthe frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest\\nwas actually before herhe was presented to her and she did\\nnot think too much had been said in his praise he was a very good\\nlooking young man height air address all were unexceptionable\\nand his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness\\nof his fathers he looked quick and sensible  she felt immediately\\nthat she should like him and there was a wellbred ease of manner\\nand a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending\\nto be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be\\n\\nhe had reached randalls the evening before  she was pleased\\nwith the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan\\nand travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half\\na day\\n\\ni told you yesterday cried mr weston with exultation i told\\nyou all that he would be here before the time named  i remembered\\nwhat i used to do myself  one cannot creep upon a journey\\none cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the\\npleasure of coming in upon ones friends before the lookout begins\\nis worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs\\n\\nit is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man\\nthough there are not many houses that i should presume on so far\\nbut in coming home i felt i might do any thing\\n\\nthe word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency\\nemma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable\\nthe conviction was strengthened by what followed  he was very much\\npleased with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house\\nwould hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation\\nthe walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more\\nand professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest\\nin the country which none but ones own country gives and the\\ngreatest curiosity to visit it  that he should never have been\\nable to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously\\nthrough emmas brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a\\npleasant one and pleasantly handled  his manner had no air of study\\nor exaggeration  he did really look and speak as if in a state of no\\ncommon enjoyment\\n\\ntheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance\\non his side were the inquirieswas she a horsewomanpleasant rides\\npleasant walkshad they a large neighbourhoodhighbury perhaps\\nafforded society enoughthere were several very pretty houses\\nin and about itballshad they ballswas it a musical society\\n\\nbut when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance\\nproportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity\\nwhile their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing\\nhis motherinlaw and speaking of her with so much handsome praise\\nso much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she\\nsecured to his father and her very kind reception of himself\\nas was an additional proof of his knowing how to please\\nand of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her\\nhe did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be\\nthoroughly deserved by mrs weston but undoubtedly he could know\\nvery little of the matter  he understood what would be welcome\\nhe could be sure of little else  his fathers marriage he said\\nhad been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it\\nand the family from whom he had received such a blessing must\\nbe ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation\\non him\\n\\nhe got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylors merits\\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\\nwas to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouses\\ncharacter than miss woodhouse miss taylors and at last as if resolved\\nto qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he\\nwound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person\\n\\nelegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he\\nbut i confess that considering every thing i had not expected\\nmore than a very tolerably welllooking woman of a certain age\\ni did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston\\n\\nyou cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings\\nsaid emma were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen\\nwith pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using\\nsuch words  dont let her imagine that you have spoken of her as\\na pretty young woman\\n\\ni hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it\\nwith a gallant bow that in addressing mrs weston i should\\nunderstand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought\\nextravagant in my terms\\n\\nemma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected\\nfrom their knowing each other which had taken strong possession\\nof her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were\\nto be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance\\nshe must see more of him to understand his ways at present she\\nonly felt they were agreeable\\n\\nshe had no doubt of what mr weston was often thinking about\\nhis quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them\\nwith a happy expression and even when he might have determined not\\nto look she was confident that he was often listening\\n\\nher own fathers perfect exemption from any thought of the kind\\nthe entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration\\nor suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance  happily he\\nwas not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it\\nthough always objecting to every marriage that was arranged\\nhe never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any\\nit seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons\\nunderstanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were\\nproved against them  she blessed the favouring blindness\\nhe could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise\\nwithout a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest\\ngive way to all his natural kindhearted civility in solicitous\\ninquiries after mr frank churchills accommodation on his journey\\nthrough the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express\\nvery genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped\\ncatching coldwhich however he could not allow him to feel quite\\nassured of himself till after another night\\n\\na reasonable visit paid mr weston began to movehe must be going\\nhe had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands\\nfor mrs weston at fords but he need not hurry any body else\\nhis son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also\\nsaying\\n\\nas you are going farther on business sir i will take the\\nopportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other\\nand therefore may as well be paid now  i have the honour of being\\nacquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady\\nresiding in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax\\ni shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house\\nthough fairfax i believe is not the proper namei should rather\\nsay barnes or bates  do you know any family of that name\\n\\nto be sure we do cried his father mrs bateswe passed her house\\ni saw miss bates at the window  true true you are acquainted\\nwith miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine\\ngirl she is  call upon her by all means\\n\\nthere is no necessity for my calling this morning said the\\nyoung man another day would do as well but there was that degree\\nof acquaintance at weymouth which\\n\\noh go today go today do not defer it  what is right to be done\\ncannot be done too soon  and besides i must give you a hint frank\\nany want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided\\nyou saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body\\nshe mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother\\nwho has barely enough to live on  if you do not call early it\\nwill be a slight\\n\\nthe son looked convinced\\n\\ni have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she is\\na very elegant young woman\\n\\nhe agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost\\nto doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct\\nsort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could\\nbe thought only ordinarily gifted with it\\n\\nif you were never particularly struck by her manners before\\nsaid she i think you will today you will see her to advantage\\nsee her and hear herno i am afraid you will not hear her at all\\nfor she has an aunt who never holds her tongue\\n\\nyou are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you\\nsaid mr woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation\\nthen give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very\\nagreeable young lady  she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama\\nand aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life\\nthey will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my\\nservants shall go with you to shew you the way\\n\\nmy dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me\\n\\nbut your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown\\nquite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses\\nyou might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk\\nunless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you\\nwhere you had best cross the street\\n\\nmr frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could\\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend\\nthis is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he\\nsees it and as to mrs batess he may get there from the crown\\nin a hop step and jump\\n\\nthey were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one\\nand a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave\\nemma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance\\nand could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of\\nthe day with full confidence in their comfort\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi\\n\\n\\nthe next morning brought mr frank churchill again  he came with\\nmrs weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially\\nhe had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home\\ntill her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse\\ntheir walk immediately fixed on highburyhe did not doubt there\\nbeing very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him\\nhe should always chuse the same  highbury that airy cheerful\\nhappylooking highbury would be his constant attraction\\nhighbury with mrs weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to\\nits bearing the same construction with him  they walked thither directly\\n\\nemma had hardly expected them  for mr weston who had called in\\nfor half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome\\nknew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize\\nto her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together\\narm in arm  she was wanting to see him again and especially\\nto see him in company with mrs weston upon his behaviour to whom\\nher opinion of him was to depend  if he were deficient there\\nnothing should make amends for it  but on seeing them together\\nshe became perfectly satisfied  it was not merely in fine words\\nor hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be\\nmore proper or pleasing than his whole manner to hernothing could\\nmore agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and\\nsecuring her affection  and there was time enough for emma to form a\\nreasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning\\nthey were all three walking about together for an hour or two\\nfirst round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury\\nhe was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently\\nfor mr woodhouses ear and when their going farther was resolved on\\nconfessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village\\nand found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma\\ncould have supposed\\n\\nsome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings\\nhe begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long\\nand which had been the home of his fathers father and on recollecting\\nthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest\\nof her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though\\nin some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit\\nthey shewed altogether a goodwill towards highbury in general\\nwhich must be very like a merit to those he was with\\n\\nemma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn\\nit could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\\nabsenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making\\na parade of insincere professions and that mr knightley certainly\\nhad not done him justice\\n\\ntheir first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house\\nthough the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of\\nposthorses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood\\nthan from any run on the road and his companions had not expected\\nto be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they\\ngave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built\\nmany years ago for a ballroom and while the neighbourhood had been\\nin a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used\\nas suchbut such brilliant days had long passed away and now the\\nhighest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist\\nclub established among the gentlemen and halfgentlemen of the place\\nhe was immediately interested  its character as a ballroom caught him\\nand instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two\\nsuperior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate\\nits capabilities and lament that its original purpose should\\nhave ceased  he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge\\nnone which they suggested  no it was long enough broad enough\\nhandsome enough  it would hold the very number for comfort\\nthey ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through\\nthe winter  why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good\\nold days of the roomshe who could do any thing in highbury\\nthe want of proper families in the place and the conviction\\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be\\ntempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied\\nhe could not be persuaded that so many goodlooking houses as he saw\\naround him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting\\nand even when particulars were given and families described he was\\nstill unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture\\nwould be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty\\nin every bodys returning into their proper place the next morning\\nhe argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and emma\\nwas rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail\\nso decidedly against the habits of the churchills  he seemed to have\\nall the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations\\nof his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe\\nof pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference\\nto a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind\\nhe could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap\\nit was but an effusion of lively spirits\\n\\nat last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown\\nand being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged\\nemma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him\\nif he had paid it\\n\\nyes oh yeshe replied i was just going to mention it\\na very successful visiti saw all the three ladies and felt very\\nmuch obliged to you for your preparatory hint  if the talking aunt\\nhad taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me\\nas it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit\\nten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that\\nwas proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home\\nbefore himbut there was no getting away no pause and to my\\nutter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else\\njoined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them\\nvery nearly threequarters of an hour  the good lady had not given me\\nthe possibility of escape before\\n\\nand how did you think miss fairfax looking\\n\\nill very illthat is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill\\nbut the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it\\nladies can never look ill  and seriously miss fairfax is naturally\\nso pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health\\na most deplorable want of complexion\\n\\nemma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss\\nfairfaxs complexion  it was certainly never brilliant but she\\nwould not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was\\na softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance\\nto the character of her face  he listened with all due deference\\nacknowledged that he had heard many people say the samebut yet he\\nmust confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want\\nof the fine glow of health  where features were indifferent\\na fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good\\nthe effect wasfortunately he need not attempt to describe what the\\neffect was\\n\\nwell said emma there is no disputing about tasteat least\\nyou admire her except her complexion\\n\\nhe shook his head and laughedi cannot separate miss fairfax\\nand her complexion\\n\\ndid you see her often at weymouth  were you often in the same society\\n\\nat this moment they were approaching fords and he hastily exclaimed\\nha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day\\nof their lives as my father informs me  he comes to highbury himself\\nhe says six days out of the seven and has always business at fords\\nif it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove\\nmyself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury\\ni must buy something at fords it will be taking out my freedom\\ni dare say they sell gloves\\n\\noh yes gloves and every thing  i do admire your patriotism\\nyou will be adored in highbury  you were very popular before you came\\nbecause you were mr westons sonbut lay out half a guinea at\\nfords and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues\\n\\nthey went in and while the sleek welltied parcels of mens beavers\\nand york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter\\nhe saidbut i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking\\nto me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst\\nof my amor patriae  do not let me lose it  i assure you the utmost\\nstretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any\\nhappiness in private life\\n\\ni merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax\\nand her party at weymouth\\n\\nand now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a\\nvery unfair one  it is always the ladys right to decide on the degree\\nof acquaintance  miss fairfax must already have given her account\\ni shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow\\n\\nupon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself\\nbut her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed\\nshe is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least\\ninformation about any body that i really think you may say what you\\nlike of your acquaintance with her\\n\\nmay i indeedthen i will speak the truth and nothing suits me\\nso well  i met her frequently at weymouth  i had known the campbells\\na little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set\\ncolonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly\\nwarmhearted woman  i like them all\\n\\nyou know miss fairfaxs situation in life i conclude what she\\nis destined to be\\n\\nyesrather hesitatinglyi believe i do\\n\\nyou get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs weston smiling\\nremember that i am heremr frank churchill hardly knows\\nwhat to say when you speak of miss fairfaxs situation in life\\ni will move a little farther off\\n\\ni certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever\\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend\\n\\nhe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment\\n\\nwhen the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again\\ndid you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play\\nsaid frank churchill\\n\\never hear her repeated emma  you forget how much she belongs\\nto highbury  i have heard her every year of our lives since we\\nboth began  she plays charmingly\\n\\nyou think so do youi wanted the opinion of some one who\\ncould really judge  she appeared to me to play well that is\\nwith considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself\\ni am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill\\nor right of judging of any bodys performancei have been used\\nto hear hers admired and i remember one proof of her being\\nthought to play wella man a very musical man and in love\\nwith another womanengaged to heron the point of marriage\\nwould yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument\\nif the lady in question could sit down insteadnever seemed\\nto like to hear one if he could hear the other  that i thought\\nin a man of known musical talent was some proof\\n\\nproof indeed said emma highly amusedmr dixon is very musical\\nis he  we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you\\nthan miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year\\n\\nyes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought\\nit a very strong proof\\n\\ncertainlyvery strong it was to own the truth a great deal\\nstronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all\\nagreeable to me  i could not excuse a mans having more music\\nthan lovemore ear than eyea more acute sensibility to fine\\nsounds than to my feelings  how did miss campbell appear to like it\\n\\nit was her very particular friend you know\\n\\npoor comfort said emma laughing  one would rather have a stranger\\npreferred than ones very particular friendwith a stranger it might\\nnot recur againbut the misery of having a very particular friend\\nalways at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself\\npoor mrs dixon  well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland\\n\\nyou are right  it was not very flattering to miss campbell\\nbut she really did not seem to feel it\\n\\nso much the betteror so much the worsei do not know which\\nbut be it sweetness or be it stupidity in herquickness of friendship\\nor dulness of feelingthere was one person i think who must have\\nfelt it  miss fairfax herself  she must have felt the improper\\nand dangerous distinction\\n\\nas to thati do not\\n\\noh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfaxs\\nsensations from you or from any body else  they are known to no\\nhuman being i guess but herself  but if she continued to play\\nwhenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses\\n\\nthere appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all\\nhe began rather quickly but checking himself added however it\\nis impossible for me to say on what terms they really were\\nhow it might all be behind the scenes  i can only say that there\\nwas smoothness outwardly  but you who have known miss fairfax from\\na child must be a better judge of her character and of how she\\nis likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be\\n\\ni have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children\\nand women together and it is natural to suppose that we should\\nbe intimatethat we should have taken to each other whenever\\nshe visited her friends  but we never did  i hardly know how it\\nhas happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side\\nwhich was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized\\nand so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother\\nand all their set  and then her reservei never could attach\\nmyself to any one so completely reserved\\n\\nit is a most repulsive quality indeed said he  oftentimes\\nvery convenient no doubt but never pleasing  there is safety\\nin reserve but no attraction  one cannot love a reserved person\\n\\nnot till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction\\nmay be the greater  but i must be more in want of a friend\\nor an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take\\nthe trouble of conquering any bodys reserve to procure one\\nintimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question\\ni have no reason to think ill of hernot the leastexcept that\\nsuch extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner\\nsuch a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt\\nto suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal\\n\\nhe perfectly agreed with her  and after walking together so long\\nand thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him\\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting\\nhe was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the\\nworld in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune\\ntherefore better than she had expected  his ideas seemed more moderate\\nhis feelings warmer  she was particularly struck by his manner\\nof considering mr eltons house which as well as the church\\nhe would go and look at and would not join them in finding much\\nfault with  no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house\\nas a man was to be pitied for having  if it were to be shared with\\nthe woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having\\nthat house  there must be ample room in it for every real comfort\\nthe man must be a blockhead who wanted more\\n\\nmrs weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about\\nused only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many\\nadvantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could\\nbe no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one\\nbut emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he\\nwas talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination\\nto settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives\\nhe might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be\\noccasioned by no housekeepers room or a bad butlers pantry\\nbut no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make\\nhim happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly\\ngive up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii\\n\\n\\nemmas very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken\\nthe following day by hearing that he was gone off to london\\nmerely to have his hair cut  a sudden freak seemed to have seized him\\nat breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to\\nreturn to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than\\nhaving his hair cut  there was certainly no harm in his travelling\\nsixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air\\nof foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve  it did\\nnot accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense\\nor even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself\\nto discern in him yesterday  vanity extravagance love of change\\nrestlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad\\nheedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs weston\\nindifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became\\nliable to all these charges  his father only called him a coxcomb\\nand thought it a very good story but that mrs weston did not like it\\nwas clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible\\nand making no other comment than that all young people would have\\ntheir little whims\\n\\nwith the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit\\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him  mrs weston\\nwas very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he\\nmade himselfhow much she saw to like in his disposition altogether\\nhe appeared to have a very open tempercertainly a very cheerful\\nand lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions\\na great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard\\nwas fond of talking of himsaid he would be the best man in the\\nworld if he were left to himself and though there was no being\\nattached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude\\nand seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect\\nthis was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy\\nfor having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy\\nof the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him\\nthe honour if not of being really in love with her of being\\nat least very near it and saved only by her own indifference\\nfor still her resolution held of never marryingthe honour in short\\nof being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance\\n\\nmr weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must\\nhave some weight  he gave her to understand that frank admired\\nher extremelythought her very beautiful and very charming\\nand with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must\\nnot judge him harshly  as mrs weston observed all young people\\nwould have their little whims\\n\\nthere was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so\\nleniently disposed  in general he was judged throughout the parishes\\nof donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances\\nwere made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man\\none who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit\\namong them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows\\nor smilesmr knightley  the circumstance was told him at hartfield\\nfor the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately\\nafterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand\\nhum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for  she had\\nhalf a mind to resent but an instants observation convinced\\nher that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings\\nand not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass\\n\\nalthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings\\nmr and mrs westons visit this morning was in another respect\\nparticularly opportune  something occurred while they were\\nat hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was\\nstill more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave\\n\\nthis was the occurrencethe coles had been settled some years\\nin highbury and were very good sort of peoplefriendly liberal\\nand unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin\\nin trade and only moderately genteel  on their first coming into\\nthe country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly\\nkeeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last\\nyear or two had brought them a considerable increase of means\\nthe house in town had yielded greater profits and fortune in general\\nhad smiled on them  with their wealth their views increased\\ntheir want of a larger house their inclination for more company\\nthey added to their house to their number of servants\\nto their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune\\nand style of living second only to the family at hartfield\\ntheir love of society and their new diningroom prepared every body\\nfor their keeping dinnercompany and a few parties chiefly among\\nthe single men had already taken place  the regular and best\\nfamilies emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite\\nneither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls  nothing should\\ntempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her fathers\\nknown habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she\\ncould wish  the coles were very respectable in their way but they\\nought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms\\non which the superior families would visit them  this lesson\\nshe very much feared they would receive only from herself\\nshe had little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston\\n\\nbut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many\\nweeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last\\nit found her very differently affected  donwell and randalls\\nhad received their invitation and none had come for her father\\nand herself and mrs westons accounting for it with i suppose\\nthey will not take the liberty with you they know you do not\\ndine out was not quite sufficient  she felt that she should\\nlike to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea\\nof the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those\\nwhose society was dearest to her occurred again and again\\nshe did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept\\nharriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses  they had\\nbeen speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before\\nand frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence\\nmight not the evening end in a dance had been a question of his\\nthe bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits\\nand her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission\\nto be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort\\n\\nit was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were\\nat hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her\\nfirst remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined\\nshe so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do\\nthat their advice for her going was most prompt and successful\\n\\nshe owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely\\nwithout inclination for the party  the coles expressed themselves\\nso properlythere was so much real attention in the manner of it\\nso much consideration for her father  they would have solicited the\\nhonour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a foldingscreen\\nfrom london which they hoped might keep mr woodhouse from any draught\\nof air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the\\nhonour of his company  upon the whole she was very persuadable\\nand it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be\\ndone without neglecting his comforthow certainly mrs goddard\\nif not mrs bates might be depended on for bearing him company\\nmr woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughters\\ngoing out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending\\nthe whole evening away from him  as for his going emma did\\nnot wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late\\nand the party too numerous  he was soon pretty well resigned\\n\\ni am not fond of dinnervisiting said hei never was\\nno more is emma  late hours do not agree with us  i am sorry\\nmr and mrs cole should have done it  i think it would be\\nmuch better if they would come in one afternoon next summer\\nand take their tea with ustake us in their afternoon walk\\nwhich they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home\\nwithout being out in the damp of the evening  the dews of a summer\\nevening are what i would not expose any body to  however as they\\nare so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you\\nwill both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her\\ni cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought\\nneither damp nor cold nor windy  then turning to mrs weston\\nwith a look of gentle reproachah  miss taylor if you had\\nnot married you would have staid at home with me\\n\\nwell sir cried mr weston as i took miss taylor away\\nit is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will\\nstep to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it\\n\\nbut the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing\\nnot lessening mr woodhouses agitation  the ladies knew better\\nhow to allay it  mr weston must be quiet and every thing\\ndeliberately arranged\\n\\nwith this treatment mr woodhouse was soon composed enough\\nfor talking as usual  he should be happy to see mrs goddard\\nhe had a great regard for mrs goddard and emma should write a line\\nand invite her  james could take the note  but first of all\\nthere must be an answer written to mrs cole\\n\\nyou will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible  you will\\nsay that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must\\ndecline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments\\nof course  but you will do every thing right  i need not tell you\\nwhat is to be done  we must remember to let james know that the carriage\\nwill be wanted on tuesday  i shall have no fears for you with him\\nwe have never been there above once since the new approach was made\\nbut still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely\\nand when you get there you must tell him at what time you would\\nhave him come for you again and you had better name an early hour\\nyou will not like staying late  you will get very tired when tea\\nis over\\n\\nbut you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa\\n\\noh no my love but you will soon be tired  there will be\\na great many people talking at once  you will not like the noise\\n\\nbut my dear sir cried mr weston if emma comes away early\\nit will be breaking up the party\\n\\nand no great harm if it does said mr woodhouse  the sooner\\nevery party breaks up the better\\n\\nbut you do not consider how it may appear to the coles\\nemmas going away directly after tea might be giving offence\\nthey are goodnatured people and think little of their own claims\\nbut still they must feel that any bodys hurrying away is no\\ngreat compliment and miss woodhouses doing it would be more thought\\nof than any other persons in the room  you would not wish to disappoint\\nand mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people\\nas ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years\\n\\nno upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged\\nto you for reminding me  i should be extremely sorry to be giving\\nthem any pain  i know what worthy people they are  perry tells\\nme that mr cole never touches malt liquor  you would not think\\nit to look at him but he is biliousmr cole is very bilious\\nno i would not be the means of giving them any pain  my dear emma\\nwe must consider this  i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting\\nmr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish\\nyou will not regard being tired  you will be perfectly safe\\nyou know among your friends\\n\\noh yes papa  i have no fears at all for myself and i should have\\nno scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account\\ni am only afraid of your sitting up for me  i am not afraid\\nof your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard\\nshe loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid\\nyou will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your\\nusual timeand the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort\\nyou must promise me not to sit up\\n\\nhe did on the condition of some promises on her side  such as that\\nif she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly\\nif hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid\\nshould sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see\\nthat every thing were safe in the house as usual\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii\\n\\n\\nfrank churchill came back again and if he kept his fathers\\ndinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs weston\\nwas too anxious for his being a favourite with mr woodhouse\\nto betray any imperfection which could be concealed\\n\\nhe came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with\\na very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed\\nof what he had done  he had no reason to wish his hair longer\\nto conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent\\nto improve his spirits  he was quite as undaunted and as lively\\nas ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself\\n\\ni do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things\\ndo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an\\nimpudent way  wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not\\nalways follyit depends upon the character of those who handle it\\nmr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man  if he were\\nhe would have done this differently  he would either have gloried\\nin the achievement or been ashamed of it  there would have been\\neither the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too\\nweak to defend its own vanitiesno i am perfectly sure that he\\nis not trifling or silly\\n\\nwith tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again\\nand for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners\\nand by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself\\nof guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness\\ninto her air and of fancying what the observations of all those\\nmight be who were now seeing them together for the first time\\n\\nshe meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at\\nmr coles and without being able to forget that among the failings\\nof mr elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed\\nher more than his propensity to dine with mr cole\\n\\nher fathers comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as\\nmrs goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty\\nbefore she left the house was to pay her respects to them as\\nthey sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly\\nnoticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all\\nthe amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake\\nand full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling selfdenial his\\ncare of their constitution might have obliged them to practise\\nduring the mealshe had provided a plentiful dinner for them\\nshe wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it\\n\\nshe followed another carriage to mr coles door and was pleased\\nto see that it was mr knightleys for mr knightley keeping\\nno horses having little spare money and a great deal of health\\nactivity and independence was too apt in emmas opinion to get\\nabout as he could and not use his carriage so often as became\\nthe owner of donwell abbey  she had an opportunity now of speaking\\nher approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out\\n\\nthis is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman\\ni am quite glad to see you\\n\\nhe thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same\\nmoment for if we had met first in the drawingroom i doubt whether\\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual\\nyou might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner\\n\\nyes i should i am sure i should  there is always a look of\\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know\\nto be beneath them  you think you carry it off very well i dare say\\nbut with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern\\ni always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances\\nnow you have nothing to try for  you are not afraid of being\\nsupposed ashamed  you are not striving to look taller than any\\nbody else  now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same\\nroom with you\\n\\nnonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger\\n\\nemma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party\\nas with mr knightley  she was received with a cordial respect\\nwhich could not but please and given all the consequence she could\\nwish for  when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love\\nthe strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife\\nthe son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked\\nher as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated\\nby herand as she firmly believed not without some dexterity\\non his side\\n\\nthe party was rather large as it included one other family a proper\\nunobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of\\nnaming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr coxs family\\nthe lawyer of highbury  the less worthy females were to come\\nin the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith\\nbut already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject\\nof conversation to be general and while politics and mr elton\\nwere talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to\\nthe pleasantness of her neighbour  the first remote sound to which\\nshe felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax\\nmrs cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be\\nvery interesting  she listened and found it well worth listening to\\nthat very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply\\nmrs cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates\\nand as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight\\nof a pianofortea very elegant looking instrumentnot a grand\\nbut a largesized square pianoforte and the substance of the story\\nthe end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry\\nand congratulations on her side and explanations on miss batess was\\nthat this pianoforte had arrived from broadwoods the day before\\nto the great astonishment of both aunt and nieceentirely unexpected\\nthat at first by miss batess account jane herself was quite at\\na loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it\\nbut now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only\\none quarterof course it must be from colonel campbell\\n\\none can suppose nothing else added mrs cole and i was only\\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt  but jane\\nit seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said\\nabout it  she knows their ways best but i should not consider their\\nsilence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present\\nthey might chuse to surprize her\\n\\nmrs cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the\\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell\\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there\\nwere enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way\\nand still listen to mrs cole\\n\\ni declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given\\nme more satisfactionit always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax\\nwho plays so delightfully should not have an instrument\\nit seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses\\nthere are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away\\nthis is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was\\nbut yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed\\nto look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawingroom while i\\ndo not know one note from another and our little girls who are\\nbut just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it\\nand there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not\\nany thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest\\nold spinet in the world to amuse herself withi was saying this\\nto mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he\\nis so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging\\nhimself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might\\nbe so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can\\nand that really is the reason why the instrument was bought\\nor else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of itwe are in great\\nhopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening\\n\\nmiss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing\\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs coles\\nturned to frank churchill\\n\\nwhy do you smile said she\\n\\nnay why do you\\n\\nmei suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbells being\\nso rich and so liberalit is a handsome present\\n\\nvery\\n\\ni rather wonder that it was never made before\\n\\nperhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before\\n\\nor that he did not give her the use of their own instrument\\nwhich must now be shut up in london untouched by any body\\n\\nthat is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large\\nfor mrs batess house\\n\\nyou may say what you chusebut your countenance testifies\\nthat your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine\\n\\ni do not know  i rather believe you are giving me more credit for\\nacuteness than i deserve  i smile because you smile and shall probably\\nsuspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what\\nthere is to question  if colonel campbell is not the person who can be\\n\\nwhat do you say to mrs dixon\\n\\nmrs dixon very true indeed  i had not thought of mrs dixon\\nshe must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument\\nwould be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize\\nis more like a young womans scheme than an elderly mans it\\nis mrs dixon i dare say  i told you that your suspicions would\\nguide mine\\n\\nif so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr dixon\\nin them\\n\\nmr dixonvery well  yes i immediately perceive that it must\\nbe the joint present of mr and mrs dixon  we were speaking the\\nother day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance\\n\\nyes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i\\nhad entertained beforei do not mean to reflect upon the good\\nintentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help\\nsuspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend\\nhe had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became\\nconscious of a little attachment on her side  one might guess\\ntwenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure\\nthere must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury\\ninstead of going with the campbells to ireland  here she must be\\nleading a life of privation and penance there it would have been\\nall enjoyment  as to the pretence of trying her native air i look\\nupon that as a mere excusein the summer it might have passed\\nbut what can any bodys native air do for them in the months\\nof january february and march  good fires and carriages would\\nbe much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i\\ndare say in hers i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions\\nthough you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly\\ntell you what they are\\n\\nand upon my word they have an air of great probability\\nmr dixons preference of her music to her friends i can answer\\nfor being very decided\\n\\nand then he saved her life  did you ever hear of that\\na water party and by some accident she was falling overboard\\nhe caught her\\n\\nhe did  i was thereone of the party\\n\\nwere you reallywellbut you observed nothing of course\\nfor it seems to be a new idea to youif i had been there i think\\ni should have made some discoveries\\n\\ni dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact\\nthat miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon\\ncaught herit was the work of a moment  and though the consequent\\nshock and alarm was very great and much more durableindeed i\\nbelieve it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again\\nyet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar\\nanxiety to be observable  i do not mean to say however that you\\nmight not have made discoveries\\n\\nthe conversation was here interrupted  they were called on to share\\nin the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses\\nand obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when\\nthe table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed\\nexactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored\\nemma said\\n\\nthe arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me  i wanted to know\\na little more and this tells me quite enough  depend upon it\\nwe shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon\\n\\nand if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we\\nmust conclude it to come from the campbells\\n\\nno i am sure it is not from the campbells  miss fairfax knows it\\nis not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first\\nshe would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them\\ni may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced\\nmyself that mr dixon is a principal in the business\\n\\nindeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced  your reasonings\\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely  at first while i\\nsupposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw\\nit only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing\\nin the world  but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more\\nprobable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship\\nand now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love\\n\\nthere was no occasion to press the matter farther  the conviction\\nseemed real he looked as if he felt it  she said no more\\nother subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away\\nthe dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked\\nto and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever\\nthings said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion\\nneither the one nor the othernothing worse than everyday remarks\\ndull repetitions old news and heavy jokes\\n\\nthe ladies had not been long in the drawingroom before the other ladies\\nin their different divisions arrived  emma watched the entree of her\\nown particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity\\nand grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the\\nartless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful\\nunsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations\\nof pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection\\nthere she satand who would have guessed how many tears she had\\nbeen lately shedding  to be in company nicely dressed herself\\nand seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty\\nand say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour\\njane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she\\nmight have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad\\nto have purchased the mortification of having lovedyes of having\\nloved even mr elton in vainby the surrender of all the dangerous\\npleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend\\n\\nin so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her\\nshe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much\\nin the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity\\nor interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance\\nbut by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced\\nand she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations\\nwere received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my\\nexcellent friend colonel campbell\\n\\nmrs weston kindhearted and musical was particularly interested\\nby the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her\\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask\\nand to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious\\nof that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she\\nplainly read in the fair heroines countenance\\n\\nthey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the\\nearly was frank churchill  in he walked the first and the handsomest\\nand after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and\\nher niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle\\nwhere sat miss woodhouse and till he could find a seat by her\\nwould not sit at all  emma divined what every body present must\\nbe thinking  she was his object and every body must perceive it\\nshe introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient\\nmoments afterwards heard what each thought of the other  he had\\nnever seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naivete\\nand she only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment\\nbut she did think there were some looks a little like mr elton\\nemma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence\\n\\nsmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\\nglancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech\\nhe told her that he had been impatient to leave the diningroom\\nhated sitting longwas always the first to move when he could\\nthat his father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left\\nvery busy over parish businessthat as long as he had staid\\nhowever it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general\\na set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of\\nhighbury altogetherthought it so abundant in agreeable families\\nthat emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place\\nrather too much  she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire\\nthe extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort\\nand could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe\\nwas concerned there was very little going on that their visitings\\nwere among a range of great families none very near and that even\\nwhen days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even\\nchance that mrs churchill were not in health and spirits for going\\nthat they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that\\nthough he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty\\nwithout considerable address at times that he could get away\\nor introduce an acquaintance for a night\\n\\nshe saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury\\ntaken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more\\nretirement at home than he liked  his importance at enscombe was\\nvery evident  he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself\\nthat he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing\\nand on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting\\none or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing\\none of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned\\nhe had wanted very much to go abroadhad been very eager indeed\\nto be allowed to travelbut she would not hear of it  this had\\nhappened the year before  now he said he was beginning to have\\nno longer the same wish\\n\\nthe unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed\\nto be good behaviour to his father\\n\\ni have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause\\ni have been here a week tomorrowhalf my time  i never knew\\ndays fly so fast  a week tomorrowand i have hardly begun to\\nenjoy myself  but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others\\ni hate the recollection\\n\\nperhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day\\nout of so few in having your hair cut\\n\\nno said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all\\ni have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself\\nfit to be seen\\n\\nthe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself\\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to mr cole\\nwhen mr cole had moved away and her attention could be restored\\nas before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room\\nat miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite\\n\\nwhat is the matter said she\\n\\nhe started  thank you for rousing me he replied  i believe\\ni have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair\\nin so odd a wayso very odd a waythat i cannot keep my eyes\\nfrom her  i never saw any thing so outreethose curlsthis must\\nbe a fancy of her own  i see nobody else looking like her\\ni must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion  shall i\\nyes i willi declare i willand you shall see how she takes it\\nwhether she colours\\n\\nhe was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss\\nfairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady\\nas he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly\\nin front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing\\n\\nbefore he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs weston\\n\\nthis is the luxury of a large party said sheone can get\\nnear every body and say every thing  my dear emma i am longing\\nto talk to you  i have been making discoveries and forming plans\\njust like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh\\ndo you know how miss bates and her niece came here\\n\\nhowthey were invited were not they\\n\\noh yesbut how they were conveyed hitherthe manner of their coming\\n\\nthey walked i conclude  how else could they come\\n\\nvery truewell a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\\nit would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night\\nand cold as the nights are now  and as i looked at her though i\\nnever saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she\\nwas heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold\\npoor girl  i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston\\ncame into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about\\nthe carriage  you may guess how readily he came into my wishes\\nand having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates\\nto assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took\\nus home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once\\ngood soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure\\nnobody was ever so fortunate as herselfbut with many\\nmany thanksthere was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightleys\\ncarriage had brought and was to take them home again  i was\\nquite surprizedvery glad i am sure but really quite surprized\\nsuch a very kind attentionand so thoughtful an attention\\nthe sort of thing that so few men would think of  and in short\\nfrom knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think\\nthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all\\ni do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself\\nand that it was only as an excuse for assisting them\\n\\nvery likely said emmanothing more likely  i know no man\\nmore likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thingto do any\\nthing really goodnatured useful considerate or benevolent\\nhe is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this\\nconsidering jane fairfaxs illhealth would appear a case\\nof humanity to himand for an act of unostentatious kindness\\nthere is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley\\ni know he had horses todayfor we arrived together and i laughed at\\nhim about it but he said not a word that could betray\\n\\nwell said mrs weston smiling you give him credit for\\nmore simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do\\nfor while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head\\nand i have never been able to get it out again  the more i think\\nof it the more probable it appears  in short i have made a match\\nbetween mr knightley and jane fairfax  see the consequence\\nof keeping you companywhat do you say to it\\n\\nmr knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma  dear mrs weston\\nhow could you think of such a thingmr knightleymr knightley\\nmust not marryyou would not have little henry cut out from donwell\\noh no no henry must have donwell  i cannot at all consent to\\nmr knightleys marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely\\ni am amazed that you should think of such a thing\\n\\nmy dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it\\ni do not want the matchi do not want to injure dear little henry\\nbut the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley\\nreally wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henrys\\naccount a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter\\n\\nyes i would  i could not bear to have henry supplanted\\nmr knightley marryno i have never had such an idea and i\\ncannot adopt it now  and jane fairfax too of all women\\n\\nnay she has always been a first favourite with him as you\\nvery well know\\n\\nbut the imprudence of such a match\\n\\ni am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability\\n\\ni see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation\\nthan what you mention  his goodnature his humanity as i tell you\\nwould be quite enough to account for the horses  he has a great\\nregard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax\\nand is always glad to shew them attention  my dear mrs weston\\ndo not take to matchmaking  you do it very ill  jane fairfax mistress\\nof the abbeyoh no noevery feeling revolts  for his own sake\\ni would not have him do so mad a thing\\n\\nimprudent if you pleasebut not mad  excepting inequality of fortune\\nand perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable\\n\\nbut mr knightley does not want to marry  i am sure he has not the\\nleast idea of it  do not put it into his head  why should he marry\\nhe is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep\\nand his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely\\nfond of his brothers children  he has no occasion to marry\\neither to fill up his time or his heart\\n\\nmy dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really\\nloves jane fairfax\\n\\nnonsense  he does not care about jane fairfax  in the way\\nof love i am sure he does not  he would do any good to her\\nor her family but\\n\\nwell said mrs weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he\\ncould do them would be to give jane such a respectable home\\n\\nif it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself\\na very shameful and degrading connexion  how would he bear to have\\nmiss bates belonging to himto have her haunting the abbey\\nand thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane\\nso very kind and obligingbut he always had been such a very\\nkind neighbour  and then fly off through half a sentence\\nto her mothers old petticoat  not that it was such a very old\\npetticoat eitherfor still it would last a great whileand indeed\\nshe must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong\\n\\nfor shame emma  do not mimic her  you divert me against\\nmy conscience  and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would\\nbe much disturbed by miss bates  little things do not irritate him\\nshe might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would\\nonly talk louder and drown her voice  but the question is not\\nwhether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it\\nand i think he does  i have heard him speak and so must you\\nso very highly of jane fairfax  the interest he takes in her\\nhis anxiety about her healthhis concern that she should have no\\nhappier prospect  i have heard him express himself so warmly on\\nthose pointssuch an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte\\nand of her voice  i have heard him say that he could listen to her\\nfor ever  oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\\nto methis pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody\\nthough we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present\\nfrom the campbells may it not be from mr knightley  i cannot\\nhelp suspecting him  i think he is just the person to do it\\neven without being in love\\n\\nthen it can be no argument to prove that he is in love\\nbut i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do\\nmr knightley does nothing mysteriously\\n\\ni have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly\\noftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common\\ncourse of things occur to him\\n\\nvery well and if he had intended to give her one he would have\\ntold her so\\n\\nthere might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma  i have a very\\nstrong notion that it comes from him  i am sure he was particularly\\nsilent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner\\n\\nyou take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have\\nmany a time reproached me with doing  i see no sign of attachment\\ni believe nothing of the pianoforteand proof only shall convince\\nme that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax\\n\\nthey combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather\\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs weston was\\nthe most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room\\nshewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation\\nand at the same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse\\nwould do them the honour of trying it  frank churchill of whom\\nin the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been\\nseeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax\\nfollowed mr cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as\\nin every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very\\nproper compliance\\n\\nshe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt\\nmore than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste\\nnor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable\\nand could accompany her own voice well  one accompaniment to her song\\ntook her agreeably by surprizea second slightly but correctly\\ntaken by frank churchill  her pardon was duly begged at the close\\nof the song and every thing usual followed  he was accused\\nof having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music\\nwhich was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter\\nand had no voice at all roundly asserted  they sang together\\nonce more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax\\nwhose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could\\nattempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own\\n\\nwith mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the\\nnumbers round the instrument to listen  frank churchill sang again\\nthey had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth\\nbut the sight of mr knightley among the most attentive soon drew\\naway half emmas mind and she fell into a train of thinking\\non the subject of mrs westons suspicions to which the sweet\\nsounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions\\nher objections to mr knightleys marrying did not in the least subside\\nshe could see nothing but evil in it  it would be a great\\ndisappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella\\na real injury to the childrena most mortifying change\\nand material loss to them alla very great deduction from her\\nfathers daily comfortand as to herself she could not at all\\nendure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey  a mrs knightley\\nfor them all to give way tonomr knightley must never marry\\nlittle henry must remain the heir of donwell\\n\\npresently mr knightley looked back and came and sat down by her\\nthey talked at first only of the performance  his admiration\\nwas certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs weston\\nit would not have struck her  as a sort of touchstone however\\nshe began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece\\nand though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short\\nshe believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any\\nkindness of his own\\n\\ni often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage\\nmore useful on such occasions  it is not that i am without the wish\\nbut you know how impossible my father would deem it that james\\nshould putto for such a purpose\\n\\nquite out of the question quite out of the question he replied\\nbut you must often wish it i am sure  and he smiled with such\\nseeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step\\n\\nthis present from the campbells said shethis pianoforte\\nis very kindly given\\n\\nyes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment\\nbut they would have done better had they given her notice of it\\nsurprizes are foolish things  the pleasure is not enhanced and the\\ninconvenience is often considerable  i should have expected better\\njudgment in colonel campbell\\n\\nfrom that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley\\nhad had no concern in giving the instrument  but whether he\\nwere entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there\\nwere no actual preferenceremained a little longer doubtful\\ntowards the end of janes second song her voice grew thick\\n\\nthat will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud\\nyou have sung quite enough for one eveningnow be quiet\\n\\nanother song however was soon begged for  one morethey would\\nnot fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for\\none more  and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could\\nmanage this without effort the first part is so very trifling\\nthe strength of the song falls on the second\\n\\nmr knightley grew angry\\n\\nthat fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing\\noff his own voice  this must not be  and touching miss bates\\nwho at that moment passed nearmiss bates are you mad to let\\nyour niece sing herself hoarse in this manner  go and interfere\\nthey have no mercy on her\\n\\nmiss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even\\nto be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all\\nfarther singing  here ceased the concert part of the evening\\nfor miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers\\nbut soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing\\noriginating nobody exactly knew wherewas so effectually promoted\\nby mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away\\nto give proper space  mrs weston capital in her countrydances\\nwas seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill\\ncoming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand\\nand led her up to the top\\n\\nwhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off\\nemma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\\nvoice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr knightley\\nthis would be a trial  he was no dancer in general  if he were to be\\nvery alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something\\nthere was no immediate appearance  no he was talking to mrs cole\\nhe was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else\\nand he was still talking to mrs cole\\n\\nemma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe\\nand she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment\\nnot more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the\\nsuddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well\\nmatched in a partner  they were a couple worth looking at\\n\\ntwo dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed\\nit was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home\\non her mothers account  after some attempts therefore to be\\npermitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs weston\\nlook sorrowful and have done\\n\\nperhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma\\nto her carriage  i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid\\ndancing would not have agreed with me after yours\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix\\n\\n\\nemma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles\\nthe visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day\\nand all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side\\nof dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour\\nof popularity  she must have delighted the colesworthy people\\nwho deserved to be made happyand left a name behind her that would\\nnot soon die away\\n\\nperfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were\\ntwo points on which she was not quite easy  she doubted whether\\nshe had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying\\nher suspicions of jane fairfaxs feelings to frank churchill\\nit was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it\\nwould escape her and his submission to all that she told\\nwas a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult\\nfor her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue\\n\\nthe other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax\\nand there she had no doubt  she did unfeignedly and unequivocally\\nregret the inferiority of her own playing and singing  she did\\nmost heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhoodand sat\\ndown and practised vigorously an hour and a half\\n\\nshe was then interrupted by harriets coming in and if harriets\\npraise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted\\n\\noh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax\\n\\ndont class us together harriet  my playing is no more like\\nhers than a lamp is like sunshine\\n\\noh deari think you play the best of the two  i think you play\\nquite as well as she does  i am sure i had much rather hear you\\nevery body last night said how well you played\\n\\nthose who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference\\nthe truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised\\nbut jane fairfaxs is much beyond it\\n\\nwell i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does\\nor that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out\\nmr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked\\na great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more\\nthan execution\\n\\nah but jane fairfax has them both harriet\\n\\nare you sure  i saw she had execution but i did not know she had\\nany taste  nobody talked about it  and i hate italian singing\\nthere is no understanding a word of it  besides if she does play\\nso very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do\\nbecause she will have to teach  the coxes were wondering last night\\nwhether she would get into any great family  how did you think the\\ncoxes looked\\n\\njust as they always dovery vulgar\\n\\nthey told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly\\nbut it is nothing of any consequence\\n\\nemma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful\\nof its producing mr elton\\n\\nthey told methat mr martin dined with them last saturday\\n\\noh\\n\\nhe came to their father upon some business and he asked him\\nto stay to dinner\\n\\noh\\n\\nthey talked a great deal about him especially anne cox\\ni do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i\\nshould go and stay there again next summer\\n\\nshe meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox\\nshould be\\n\\nshe said he was very agreeable the day he dined there  he sat\\nby her at dinner  miss nash thinks either of the coxes would\\nbe very glad to marry him\\n\\nvery likelyi think they are without exception the most vulgar\\ngirls in highbury\\n\\nharriet had business at fordsemma thought it most prudent to go\\nwith her  another accidental meeting with the martins was possible\\nand in her present state would be dangerous\\n\\nharriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always\\nvery long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins\\nand changing her mind emma went to the door for amusementmuch could\\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury\\nmr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting himself in at\\nthe officedoor mr coles carriagehorses returning from exercise\\nor a stray letterboy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest\\nobjects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on\\nthe butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from\\nshop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone\\nand a string of dawdling children round the bakers little bowwindow\\neyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain\\nand was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door\\na mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see\\nnothing that does not answer\\n\\nshe looked down the randalls road  the scene enlarged\\ntwo persons appeared mrs weston and her soninlaw they were\\nwalking into highburyto hartfield of course  they were stopping\\nhowever in the first place at mrs batess whose house was\\na little nearer randalls than fords and had all but knocked\\nwhen emma caught their eyeimmediately they crossed the road\\nand came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterdays\\nengagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting\\nmrs weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses\\nin order to hear the new instrument\\n\\nfor my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised\\nmiss bates last night that i would come this morning  i was\\nnot aware of it myself  i did not know that i had fixed a day\\nbut as he says i did i am going now\\n\\nand while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope\\nsaid frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfield\\nif you are going home\\n\\nmrs weston was disappointed\\n\\ni thought you meant to go with me  they would be very much pleased\\n\\nme  i should be quite in the way  but perhapsi may be equally\\nin the way here  miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me\\nmy aunt always sends me off when she is shopping  she says i fidget\\nher to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say\\nthe same  what am i to do\\n\\ni am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting\\nfor my friend  she will probably have soon done and then we\\nshall go home  but you had better go with mrs weston and hear\\nthe instrument\\n\\nwellif you advise itbut with a smile if colonel campbell\\nshould have employed a careless friend and if it should prove\\nto have an indifferent tonewhat shall i say  i shall be no\\nsupport to mrs weston  she might do very well by herself\\na disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i\\nam the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood\\n\\ni do not believe any such thing replied emmai am persuaded\\nthat you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary\\nbut there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent\\nquite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfaxs opinion\\nlast night\\n\\ndo come with me said mrs weston if it be not very disagreeable\\nto you  it need not detain us long  we will go to hartfield afterwards\\nwe will follow them to hartfield  i really wish you to call with me\\nit will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you\\nmeant it\\n\\nhe could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him\\nreturned with mrs weston to mrs batess door  emma watched them in\\nand then joined harriet at the interesting countertrying with all\\nthe force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain\\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon\\nbe it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern\\nat last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel\\n\\nshould i send it to mrs goddards maam asked mrs ford\\nyesnoyes to mrs goddards only my pattern gown is\\nat hartfield  no you shall send it to hartfield if you please\\nbut then mrs goddard will want to see itand i could take the\\npattern gown home any day  but i shall want the ribbon directly\\nso it had better go to hartfieldat least the ribbon  you could\\nmake it into two parcels mrs ford could not you\\n\\nit is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble\\nof two parcels\\n\\nno more it is\\n\\nno trouble in the world maam said the obliging mrs ford\\n\\noh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one\\nthen if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddards\\ni do not knowno i think miss woodhouse i may just as well\\nhave it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night\\nwhat do you advise\\n\\nthat you do not give another halfsecond to the subject\\nto hartfield if you please mrs ford\\n\\naye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied\\ni should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddards\\n\\nvoices approached the shopor rather one voice and two ladies\\nmrs weston and miss bates met them at the door\\n\\nmy dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to\\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while\\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith\\nhow do you do miss smithvery well i thank youand i begged\\nmrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding\\n\\ni hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are\\n\\nvery well i am much obliged to you  my mother is delightfully well\\nand jane caught no cold last night  how is mr woodhousei am so glad\\nto hear such a good account  mrs weston told me you were here\\noh then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will\\nallow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother\\nwill be so very happy to see herand now we are such a nice party\\nshe cannot refuseaye pray do said mr frank churchill\\nmiss woodhouses opinion of the instrument will be worth having\\nbut said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go\\nwith meoh said he wait half a minute till i have finished\\nmy jobfor would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is\\nin the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my\\nmothers spectaclesthe rivet came out you know this morning\\nso very obligingfor my mother had no use of her spectacles\\ncould not put them on  and by the bye every body ought to have\\ntwo pair of spectacles they should indeed  jane said so\\ni meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did\\nbut something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing\\nthen another there is no saying what you know  at one time patty came\\nto say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping  oh said i\\npatty do not come with your bad news to me  here is the rivet\\nof your mistresss spectacles out  then the baked apples came home\\nmrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and\\nobliging to us the wallises alwaysi have heard some people\\nsay that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer\\nbut we have never known any thing but the greatest attention\\nfrom them  and it cannot be for the value of our custom now\\nfor what is our consumption of bread you know  only three of us\\nbesides dear jane at presentand she really eats nothingmakes such\\na shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it\\ni dare not let my mother know how little she eatsso i say one\\nthing and then i say another and it passes off  but about the\\nmiddle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes\\nso well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome\\nfor i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry\\ni happened to meet him in the street  not that i had any doubt before\\ni have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple\\ni believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the\\nfruit thoroughly wholesome  we have appledumplings however\\nvery often  patty makes an excellent appledumpling well\\nmrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will\\noblige us\\n\\nemma would be very happy to wait on mrs bates c and they\\ndid at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss\\nbates than\\n\\nhow do you do mrs ford  i beg your pardon  i did not see\\nyou before  i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons\\nfrom town  jane came back delighted yesterday  thank ye\\nthe gloves do very wellonly a little too large about the wrist\\nbut jane is taking them in\\n\\nwhat was i talking of said she beginning again when they were\\nall in the street\\n\\nemma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix\\n\\ni declare i cannot recollect what i was talking ofoh my\\nmothers spectacles  so very obliging of mr frank churchill\\noh said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job\\nof this kind excessivelywhich you know shewed him to be so\\nvery    indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him\\nbefore and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any\\nthing    i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly\\nhe seems every thing the fondest parent could    oh said he\\ni can fasten the rivet  i like a job of that sort excessively\\ni never shall forget his manner  and when i brought out the baked\\napples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very\\nobliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing\\nin the way of fruit half so good and these are the finestlooking\\nhomebaked apples i ever saw in my life  that you know was so\\nvery    and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment\\nindeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them\\nfull justiceonly we do not have them baked more than twice\\nand mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times\\nbut miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it  the apples\\nthemselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt\\nall from donwellsome of mr knightleys most liberal supply\\nhe sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such\\na keeping apple anywhere as one of his treesi believe there\\nis two of them  my mother says the orchard was always famous\\nin her younger days  but i was really quite shocked the other day\\nfor mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples\\nand we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them\\nand he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock\\ni am sure you must be said he and i will send you\\nanother supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use\\nwilliam larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year\\ni will send you some more before they get good for nothing\\nso i begged he would notfor really as to ours being gone i could\\nnot absolutely say that we had a great many leftit was but half\\na dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could\\nnot at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he\\nhad been already and jane said the same  and when he was gone\\nshe almost quarrelled with meno i should not say quarrelled\\nfor we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed\\nthat i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had\\nmade him believe we had a great many left  oh said i my dear\\ni did say as much as i could  however the very same evening\\nwilliam larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same\\nsort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged\\nand went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing\\nas you may suppose  william larkins is such an old acquaintance\\ni am always glad to see him  but however i found afterwards\\nfrom patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort\\nhis master had he had brought them alland now his master had not\\none left to bake or boil  william did not seem to mind it himself\\nhe was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william\\nyou know thinks more of his masters profit than any thing\\nbut mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being\\nall sent away  she could not bear that her master should not be\\nable to have another appletart this spring  he told patty this\\nbut bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us\\nabout it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as\\nso many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder\\nand so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed\\ni would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for\\nthe world  he would be so very    i wanted to keep it from\\njanes knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was\\naware\\n\\nmiss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors\\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to\\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory goodwill\\n\\npray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning\\npray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase\\nrather darker and narrower than one could wish  miss smith\\npray take care  miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you\\nhit your foot  miss smith the step at the turning\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x\\n\\n\\nthe appearance of the little sittingroom as they entered\\nwas tranquillity itself mrs bates deprived of her usual employment\\nslumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table\\nnear her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax\\nstanding with her back to them intent on her pianoforte\\n\\nbusy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most\\nhappy countenance on seeing emma again\\n\\nthis is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at\\nleast ten minutes earlier than i had calculated  you find me\\ntrying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed\\n\\nwhat said mrs weston have not you finished it yet you would\\nnot earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate\\n\\ni have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been\\nassisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily\\nit was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe\\nyou see we have been wedging one leg with paper  this was very kind\\nof you to be persuaded to come  i was almost afraid you would be\\nhurrying home\\n\\nhe contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently\\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying\\nto make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was\\nquite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again  that she was not\\nimmediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves\\nshe had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it\\nwithout emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance\\nand emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin\\nand could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again\\n\\nat last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given\\nthe powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to\\nmrs weston had been delighted before and was delighted again\\nemma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every\\nproper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the\\nhighest promise\\n\\nwhoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill\\nwith a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill  i heard a good\\ndeal of colonel campbells taste at weymouth and the softness of the\\nupper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would\\nparticularly prize  i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave\\nhis friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself\\ndo not you think so\\n\\njane did not look round  she was not obliged to hear  mrs weston\\nhad been speaking to her at the same moment\\n\\nit is not fair said emma in a whisper mine was a random guess\\ndo not distress her\\n\\nhe shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little\\ndoubt and very little mercy  soon afterwards he began again\\n\\nhow much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure\\non this occasion miss fairfax  i dare say they often think of you\\nand wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instruments\\ncoming to hand  do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business\\nto be going forward just at this timedo you imagine it to be\\nthe consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may\\nhave sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time\\nto depend upon contingencies and conveniences\\n\\nhe paused  she could not but hear she could not avoid answering\\n\\ntill i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice\\nof forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence\\nit must be all conjecture\\n\\nconjectureaye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes\\none conjectures wrong  i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall\\nmake this rivet quite firm  what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse\\nwhen hard at work if one talks at allyour real workmen\\ni suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get\\nhold of a wordmiss fairfax said something about conjecturing\\nthere it is done  i have the pleasure madam to mrs bates\\nof restoring your spectacles healed for the present\\n\\nhe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape\\na little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged\\nmiss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more\\n\\nif you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes\\nwe danced last nightlet me live them over again  you did not\\nenjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time  i believe\\nyou were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds\\nall the worlds one ever has to givefor another halfhour\\n\\nshe played\\n\\nwhat felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy\\nif i mistake not that was danced at weymouth\\n\\nshe looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played\\nsomething else  he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte\\nand turning to emma said\\n\\nhere is something quite new to me  do you know itcramer\\nand here are a new set of irish melodies  that from such a quarter\\none might expect  this was all sent with the instrument  very thoughtful\\nof colonel campbell was not ithe knew miss fairfax could have\\nno music here  i honour that part of the attention particularly\\nit shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart  nothing hastily\\ndone nothing incomplete  true affection only could have prompted it\\n\\nemma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused\\nand when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught\\nthe remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush\\nof consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight\\nshe had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction\\nwith respect to herthis amiable upright perfect jane fairfax\\nwas apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings\\n\\nhe brought all the music to her and they looked it over together\\nemma took the opportunity of whispering\\n\\nyou speak too plain  she must understand you\\n\\ni hope she does  i would have her understand me  i am not\\nin the least ashamed of my meaning\\n\\nbut really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up\\nthe idea\\n\\ni am very glad you did and that you communicated it to me\\ni have now a key to all her odd looks and ways  leave shame to her\\nif she does wrong she ought to feel it\\n\\nshe is not entirely without it i think\\n\\ni do not see much sign of it  she is playing robin adair\\nat this momenthis favourite\\n\\nshortly afterwards miss bates passing near the window\\ndescried mr knightley on horseback not far off\\n\\nmr knightley i declarei must speak to him if possible\\njust to thank him  i will not open the window here it would give\\nyou all cold but i can go into my mothers room you know  i dare\\nsay he will come in when he knows who is here  quite delightful\\nto have you all meet soour little room so honoured\\n\\nshe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening\\nthe casement there immediately called mr knightleys attention\\nand every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard\\nby the others as if it had passed within the same apartment\\n\\nhow d ye dohow dye dovery well i thank you  so obliged\\nto you for the carriage last night  we were just in time\\nmy mother just ready for us  pray come in do come in  you will\\nfind some friends here\\n\\nso began miss bates and mr knightley seemed determined to be heard\\nin his turn for most resolutely and commandingly did he say\\n\\nhow is your niece miss batesi want to inquire after you all\\nbut particularly your niece  how is miss fairfaxi hope she\\ncaught no cold last night  how is she today tell me how miss\\nfairfax is\\n\\nand miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he\\nwould hear her in any thing else  the listeners were amused\\nand mrs weston gave emma a look of particular meaning  but emma\\nstill shook her head in steady scepticism\\n\\nso obliged to youso very much obliged to you for the carriage\\nresumed miss bates\\n\\nhe cut her short with\\n\\ni am going to kingston  can i do any thing for you\\n\\noh dear kingstonare youmrs cole was saying the other day\\nshe wanted something

frank churchill are hearing every thing\\nthat passes  and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss\\nfairfax should not be mentioned too  i think miss fairfax dances\\nvery well and mrs weston is the very best countrydance player\\nwithout exception in england  now if your friends have any gratitude\\nthey will say something pretty loud about you and me in return\\nbut i cannot stay to hear it\\n\\noh  mr knightley one moment more something of consequence\\nso shockedjane and i are both so shocked about the apples\\n\\nwhat is the matter now\\n\\nto think of your sending us all your store apples  you said you had\\na great many and now you have not one left  we really are so shocked\\nmrs hodges may well be angry  william larkins mentioned it here\\nyou should not have done it indeed you should not  ah he is off\\nhe never can bear to be thanked  but i thought he would have staid now\\nand it would have been a pity not to have mentioned    well\\nreturning to the room i have not been able to succeed\\nmr knightley cannot stop  he is going to kingston  he asked me\\nif he could do any thing   \\n\\nyes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing\\n\\noh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door\\nwas open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud\\nyou must have heard every thing to be sure  can i do any thing\\nfor you at kingston said he so i just mentioned    oh\\nmiss woodhouse must you be goingyou seem but just comeso very\\nobliging of you\\n\\nemma found it really time to be at home the visit had already\\nlasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was\\nperceived to be gone that mrs weston and her companion taking\\nleave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young\\nladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi\\n\\n\\nit may be possible to do without dancing entirely  instances have\\nbeen known of young people passing many many months successively\\nwithout being at any ball of any description and no material injury\\naccrue either to body or mindbut when a beginning is made\\nwhen the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly\\nfeltit must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more\\n\\nfrank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again\\nand the last halfhour of an evening which mr woodhouse was persuaded\\nto spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young\\npeople in schemes on the subject  franks was the first idea\\nand his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best\\njudge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation\\nand appearance  but still she had inclination enough for shewing\\npeople again how delightfully mr frank churchill and miss\\nwoodhouse dancedfor doing that in which she need not blush to compare\\nherself with jane fairfaxand even for simple dancing itself\\nwithout any of the wicked aids of vanityto assist him first\\nin pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made\\nto holdand then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour\\nin the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr weston could\\nsay of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest\\n\\nhis first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr coles\\nshould be finished therethat the same party should be collected\\nand the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence\\nmr weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment\\nand mrs weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they\\ncould wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed\\nof reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the\\nindispensable division of space to every couple\\n\\nyou and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two\\nmiss coxes five had been repeated many times over  and there\\nwill be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself\\nbesides mr knightley  yes that will be quite enough for pleasure\\nyou and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss\\ncoxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room\\n\\nbut soon it came to be on one side\\n\\nbut will there be good room for five couplei really do not think\\nthere will\\n\\non another\\n\\nand after all five couple are not enough to make it worth\\nwhile to stand up  five couple are nothing when one thinks\\nseriously about it  it will not do to invite five couple\\nit can be allowable only as the thought of the moment\\n\\nsomebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brothers\\nand must be invited with the rest  somebody else believed\\nmrs gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had\\nbeen asked  a word was put in for a second young cox and at last\\nmr weston naming one family of cousins who must be included\\nand another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out\\nit became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten\\nand a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they\\ncould be disposed of\\n\\nthe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other\\nmight not they use both rooms and dance across the passage\\nit seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that\\nmany of them wanted a better  emma said it would be awkward\\nmrs weston was in distress about the supper and mr woodhouse\\nopposed it earnestly on the score of health  it made him so\\nvery unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in\\n\\noh no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence\\ni could not bear it for emmaemma is not strong  she would\\ncatch a dreadful cold  so would poor little harriet\\nso you would all  mrs weston you would be quite laid up\\ndo not let them talk of such a wild thing  pray do not let them\\ntalk of it  that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless\\ndo not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing\\nhe has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping\\nthem open very inconsiderately  he does not think of the draught\\ni do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite\\nthe thing\\n\\nmrs weston was sorry for such a charge  she knew the importance\\nof it and said every thing in her power to do it away  every door\\nwas now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme\\nof dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again\\nand with such goodwill on frank churchills part that the space\\nwhich a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient\\nfor five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough\\nfor ten\\n\\nwe were too magnificent said he  we allowed unnecessary room\\nten couple may stand here very well\\n\\nemma demurred  it would be a crowda sad crowd and what could\\nbe worse than dancing without space to turn in\\n\\nvery true he gravely replied it was very bad  but still he\\nwent on measuring and still he ended with\\n\\ni think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple\\n\\nno no said she you are quite unreasonable  it would be dreadful\\nto be standing so close  nothing can be farther from pleasure\\nthan to be dancing in a crowdand a crowd in a little room\\n\\nthere is no denying it he replied  i agree with you exactly\\na crowd in a little roommiss woodhouse you have the art of giving\\npictures in a few words  exquisite quite exquisitestill however\\nhaving proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up\\nit would be a disappointment to my fatherand altogetheri do\\nnot know thati am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand\\nhere very well\\n\\nemma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\\nselfwilled and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure\\nof dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave\\nthe rest  had she intended ever to marry him it might have been\\nworth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value\\nof his preference and the character of his temper but for\\nall the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough\\n\\nbefore the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered\\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance\\nof the scheme  it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement\\n\\nwell miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination\\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the\\nterrors of my fathers little rooms  i bring a new proposal\\non the subjecta thought of my fathers which waits only your\\napprobation to be acted upon  may i hope for the honour of your\\nhand for the two first dances of this little projected ball\\nto be given not at randalls but at the crown inn\\n\\nthe crown\\n\\nyes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot\\nmy father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there\\nbetter accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful\\nwelcome than at randalls  it is his own idea  mrs weston sees\\nno objection to it provided you are satisfied  this is what we\\nall feel  oh you were perfectly right  ten couple in either of\\nthe randalls rooms would have been insufferabledreadfuli felt\\nhow right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing\\nany thing to like to yield  is not it a good exchangeyou consent\\ni hope you consent\\n\\nit appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and\\nmrs weston do not  i think it admirable and as far as i can\\nanswer for myself shall be most happyit seems the only improvement\\nthat could be  papa do you not think it an excellent improvement\\n\\nshe was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully\\ncomprehended and then being quite new farther representations\\nwere necessary to make it acceptable\\n\\nno he thought it very far from an improvementa very bad plan\\nmuch worse than the other  a room at an inn was always damp\\nand dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited\\nif they must dance they had better dance at randalls  he had never\\nbeen in the room at the crown in his lifedid not know the people\\nwho kept it by sightoh noa very bad plan  they would catch\\nworse colds at the crown than anywhere\\n\\ni was going to observe sir said frank churchill\\nthat one of the great recommendations of this change would\\nbe the very little danger of any bodys catching cold\\nso much less danger at the crown than at randalls  mr perry\\nmight have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could\\n\\nsir said mr woodhouse rather warmly you are very much\\nmistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character\\nmr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill  but i\\ndo not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you\\nthan your fathers house\\n\\nfrom the very circumstance of its being larger sir  we shall have\\nno occasion to open the windows at allnot once the whole evening\\nand it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold\\nair upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief\\n\\nopen the windowsbut surely mr churchill nobody would think\\nof opening the windows at randalls  nobody could be so imprudent\\ni never heard of such a thing  dancing with open windowsi am sure\\nneither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was\\nwould suffer it\\n\\nah sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind\\na windowcurtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected\\ni have often known it done myself\\n\\nhave you indeed sirbless me  i never could have supposed it\\nbut i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear\\nhowever this does make a difference and perhaps when we come\\nto talk it overbut these sort of things require a good deal\\nof consideration  one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry\\nif mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning\\nwe may talk it over and see what can be done\\n\\nbut unfortunately sir my time is so limited\\n\\noh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking\\nevery thing over  there is no hurry at all  if it can be contrived\\nto be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses\\nthey will be so near their own stable\\n\\nso they will my dear  that is a great thing  not that james\\never complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can\\nif i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly airedbut is\\nmrs stokes to be trusted  i doubt it  i do not know her\\neven by sight\\n\\ni can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will\\nbe under mrs westons care  mrs weston undertakes to direct\\nthe whole\\n\\nthere papanow you must be satisfiedour own dear mrs weston\\nwho is carefulness itself  do not you remember what mr perry said\\nso many years ago when i had the measles  if miss taylor undertakes\\nto wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir  how often\\nhave i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her\\n\\naye very true  mr perry did say so  i shall never forget it\\npoor little emma  you were very bad with the measles that is\\nyou would have been very bad but for perrys great attention\\nhe came four times a day for a week  he said from the first\\nit was a very good sortwhich was our great comfort but the measles\\nare a dreadful complaint  i hope whenever poor isabellas little ones\\nhave the measles she will send for perry\\n\\nmy father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment\\nsaid frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house\\ni left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion\\nand hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice\\non the spot  i was desired to say so from both  it would be the\\ngreatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there\\nthey can do nothing satisfactorily without you\\n\\nemma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father\\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young\\npeople set off together without delay for the crown  there were\\nmr and mrs weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation\\nvery busy and very happy in their different way she in some\\nlittle distress and he finding every thing perfect\\n\\nemma said she this paper is worse than i expected\\nlook in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot\\nis more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined\\n\\nmy dear you are too particular said her husband  what does\\nall that signify  you will see nothing of it by candlelight\\nit will be as clean as randalls by candlelight  we never see any\\nthing of it on our clubnights\\n\\nthe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never\\nknow when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps\\nthought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses\\nand needless cares\\n\\none perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain\\nit regarded a supperroom  at the time of the ballrooms being built\\nsuppers had not been in question and a small cardroom adjoining\\nwas the only addition  what was to be done  this cardroom would\\nbe wanted as a cardroom now or if cards were conveniently voted\\nunnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for\\nany comfortable supper  another room of much better size might be\\nsecured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house\\nand a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it\\nthis made a difficulty  mrs weston was afraid of draughts\\nfor the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the\\ngentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded\\nat supper\\n\\nmrs weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches\\nc set out in the little room but that was scouted as a\\nwretched suggestion  a private dance without sitting down to supper\\nwas pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women\\nand mrs weston must not speak of it again  she then took another\\nline of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed\\n\\ni do not think it is so very small  we shall not be many\\nyou know\\n\\nand mr weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps\\nthrough the passage was calling out\\n\\nyou talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear\\nit is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from\\nthe stairs\\n\\ni wish said mrs weston one could know which arrangement our\\nguests in general would like best  to do what would be most generally\\npleasing must be our objectif one could but tell what that would be\\n\\nyes very true cried frank very true  you want your neighbours\\nopinions  i do not wonder at you  if one could ascertain what the\\nchief of themthe coles for instance  they are not far off\\nshall i call upon them  or miss bates  she is still nearer\\nand i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand\\nthe inclinations of the rest of the people as any body  i think\\nwe do want a larger council  suppose i go and invite miss bates\\nto join us\\n\\nwellif you please said mrs weston rather hesitating if you\\nthink she will be of any use\\n\\nyou will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma\\nshe will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing\\nshe will not even listen to your questions  i see no advantage in\\nconsulting miss bates\\n\\nbut she is so amusing so extremely amusing  i am very fond\\nof hearing miss bates talk  and i need not bring the whole family\\nyou know\\n\\nhere mr weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed\\ngave it his decided approbation\\n\\naye do frankgo and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter\\nat once  she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know\\na properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties\\nfetch miss bates  we are growing a little too nice  she is\\na standing lesson of how to be happy  but fetch them both\\ninvite them both\\n\\nboth sir  can the old lady   \\n\\nthe old lady  no the young lady to be sure  i shall think you\\na great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece\\n\\noh  i beg your pardon sir  i did not immediately recollect\\nundoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both\\nand away he ran\\n\\nlong before he reappeared attending the short neat briskmoving aunt\\nand her elegant niecemrs weston like a sweettempered\\nwoman and a good wife had examined the passage again\\nand found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before\\nindeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision\\nall the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth\\nall the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music\\ntea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles\\nto be settled at any time between mrs weston and mrs stokes\\nevery body invited was certainly to come frank had already written\\nto enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight\\nwhich could not possibly be refused  and a delightful dance it was\\nto be\\n\\nmost cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must\\nas a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much\\nsafer character she was truly welcome  her approbation at once\\ngeneral and minute warm and incessant could not but please\\nand for another halfhour they were all walking to and fro\\nbetween the different rooms some suggesting some attending\\nand all in happy enjoyment of the future  the party did not break\\nup without emmas being positively secured for the two first dances\\nby the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr weston\\nwhisper to his wife he has asked her my dear  thats right\\ni knew he would\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xii\\n\\n\\none thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball\\ncompletely satisfactory to emmaits being fixed for a day within\\nthe granted term of frank churchills stay in surry for in spite\\nof mr westons confidence she could not think it so very impossible\\nthat the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain\\na day beyond his fortnight  but this was not judged feasible\\nthe preparations must take their time nothing could be properly\\nready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they\\nmust be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertaintyat the risk\\nin her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain\\n\\nenscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word\\nhis wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was\\nnot opposed  all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one\\nsolicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain\\nof her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr knightleys\\nprovoking indifference about it  either because he did not\\ndance himself or because the plan had been formed without his\\nbeing consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him\\ndetermined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording\\nhim any future amusement  to her voluntary communications emma\\ncould get no more approving reply than\\n\\nvery well  if the westons think it worth while to be at all this\\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing\\nto say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me\\noh yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep\\nas much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over\\nwilliam larkinss weeks account much rather i confess\\npleasure in seeing dancingnot i indeedi never look at it\\ni do not know who doesfine dancing i believe like virtue\\nmust be its own reward  those who are standing by are usually\\nthinking of something very different\\n\\nthis emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry\\nit was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was\\nso indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings\\nin reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it\\nto an extraordinary degree  it made her animatedopen hearted\\nshe voluntarily said\\n\\noh  miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball\\nwhat a disappointment it would be  i do look forward to it i own\\nwith very great pleasure\\n\\nit was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have\\npreferred the society of william larkins  noshe was more and more\\nconvinced that mrs weston was quite mistaken in that surmise\\nthere was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment\\non his sidebut no love\\n\\nalas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley\\ntwo days of joyful security were immediately followed by the\\noverthrow of every thing  a letter arrived from mr churchill\\nto urge his nephews instant return  mrs churchill was unwell\\nfar too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering\\nstate so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before\\nthough from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant\\nhabit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it\\nbut now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off\\nfor enscombe without delay\\n\\nthe substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note\\nfrom mrs weston instantly  as to his going it was inevitable\\nhe must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real\\nalarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance  he knew her illnesses\\nthey never occurred but for her own convenience\\n\\nmrs weston added that he could only allow himself time to\\nhurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few\\nfriends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him\\nand that he might be expected at hartfield very soon\\n\\nthis wretched note was the finale of emmas breakfast  when once\\nit had been read there was no doing any thing but lament\\nand exclaim  the loss of the ballthe loss of the young man\\nand all that the young man might be feelingit was too wretched\\nsuch a delightful evening as it would have beenevery body so happy\\nand she and her partner the happiesti said it would be so\\nwas the only consolation\\n\\nher fathers feelings were quite distinct  he thought principally\\nof mrs churchills illness and wanted to know how she was treated\\nand as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed\\nbut they would all be safer at home\\n\\nemma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared\\nbut if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful\\nlook and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him\\nhe felt the going away almost too much to speak of it  his dejection\\nwas most evident  he sat really lost in thought for the first\\nfew minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say\\n\\nof all horrid things leavetaking is the worst\\n\\nbut you will come again said emma  this will not be your only\\nvisit to randalls\\n\\nahshaking his headthe uncertainty of when i may be able\\nto returni shall try for it with a zealit will be the object\\nof all my thoughts and caresand if my uncle and aunt go to town\\nthis springbut i am afraidthey did not stir last

destroyed by preparation\\nfoolish preparationyou told us it would be sooh  miss woodhouse\\nwhy are you always so right\\n\\nindeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance  i would\\nmuch rather have been merry than wise\\n\\nif i can come again we are still to have our ball  my father\\ndepends on it  do not forget your engagement\\n\\nemma looked graciously\\n\\nsuch a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more\\nprecious and more delightful than the day beforeevery day making\\nme less fit to bear any other place  happy those who can remain\\nat highbury\\n\\nas you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will\\nventure to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first\\ndo not we rather surpass your expectations  i am sure we do\\ni am sure you did not much expect to like us  you would not have been\\nso long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury\\n\\nhe laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment\\nemma was convinced that it had been so\\n\\nand you must be off this very morning\\n\\nyes my father is to join me here  we shall walk back together\\nand i must be off immediately  i am almost afraid that every moment\\nwill bring him\\n\\nnot five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and\\nmiss bates  how unlucky  miss batess powerful argumentative mind\\nmight have strengthened yours\\n\\nyesi have called there passing the door i thought it better\\nit was a right thing to do  i went in for three minutes and was\\ndetained by miss batess being absent  she was out and i felt it\\nimpossible not to wait till she came in  she is a woman that one may\\nthat one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight\\nit was better to pay my visit then\\n\\nhe hesitated got up walked to a window\\n\\nin short said he perhaps miss woodhousei think you can\\nhardly be quite without suspicion\\n\\nhe looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts  she hardly\\nknew what to say  it seemed like the forerunner of something\\nabsolutely serious which she did not wish  forcing herself\\nto speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said\\n\\nyou are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then\\n\\nhe was silent  she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting\\non what she had said and trying to understand the manner\\nshe heard him sigh  it was natural for him to feel that he had\\ncause to sigh  he could not believe her to be encouraging him\\na few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more\\ndetermined manner said\\n\\nit was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be\\ngiven to hartfield  my regard for hartfield is most warm\\n\\nhe stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed\\nhe was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say\\nhow it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance\\nmr woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made\\nhim composed\\n\\na very few minutes more however completed the present trial\\nmr weston always alert when business was to be done and as\\nincapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable\\nas of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go\\nand the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree\\nto take leave\\n\\ni shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation\\ni shall hear of every thing that is going on among you  i have\\nengaged mrs weston to correspond with me  she has been so kind as\\nto promise it  oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one\\nis really interested in the absentshe will tell me every thing\\nin her letters i shall be at dear highbury again\\n\\na very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest goodbye\\nclosed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill\\nshort had been the noticeshort their meeting he was gone and emma\\nfelt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little\\nsociety from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry\\nand feeling it too much\\n\\nit was a sad change  they had been meeting almost every day\\nsince his arrival  certainly his being at randalls had given\\ngreat spirit to the last two weeksindescribable spirit the idea\\nthe expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought\\nthe assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners\\nit had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking\\nfrom it into the common course of hartfield days  to complete every\\nother recommendation he had almost told her that he loved her\\nwhat strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to\\nwas another point but at present she could not doubt his having\\na decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself\\nand this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that\\nshe must be a little in love with him in spite of every previous\\ndetermination against it\\n\\ni certainly must said she  this sensation of listlessness\\nweariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself\\nthis feeling of every things being dull and insipid about the house\\ni must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i\\nwere notfor a few weeks at least  well evil to some is always\\ngood to others  i shall have many fellowmourners for the ball\\nif not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy\\nhe may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes\\n\\nmr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness  he could\\nnot say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look\\nwould have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily\\nthat he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with\\nconsiderable kindness added\\n\\nyou emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really\\nout of luck you are very much out of luck\\n\\nit was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her\\nhonest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet\\nher composure was odious  she had been particularly unwell however\\nsuffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare\\nthat had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have\\nattended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming\\nindifference to the languor of illhealth\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiii\\n\\n\\nemma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love  her ideas\\nonly varied as to the how much  at first she thought it was a good deal\\nand afterwards but little  she had great pleasure in hearing frank\\nchurchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever\\nin seeing mr and mrs weston she was very often thinking of him\\nand quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was\\nhow were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance\\nof his coming to randalls again this spring  but on the other hand\\nshe could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the\\nfirst morning to be less disposed for employment than usual\\nshe was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could\\nyet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him\\nso much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand\\namusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment\\nfancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters\\nthe conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she\\nrefused him  their affection was always to subside into friendship\\nevery thing tender and charming was to mark their parting\\nbut still they were to part  when she became sensible of this\\nit struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite\\nof her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father\\nnever to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more\\nof a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings\\n\\ni do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said she\\nin not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives\\nis there any allusion to making a sacrifice  i do suspect that he\\nis not really necessary to my happiness  so much the better\\ni certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do  i am\\nquite enough in love  i should be sorry to be more\\n\\nupon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings\\n\\nhe is undoubtedly very much in loveevery thing denotes itvery much\\nin love indeedand when he comes again if his affection continue\\ni must be on my guard not to encourage itit would be most\\ninexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up\\nnot that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto\\nno if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would\\nnot have been so wretched  could he have thought himself encouraged\\nhis looks and language at parting would have been different\\nstill however i must be on my guard  this is in the supposition\\nof his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i\\nexpect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man\\ni do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy\\nhis feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable\\nevery consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful\\nthat my happiness is not more deeply involvedi shall do very well\\nagain after a little whileand then it will be a good thing over\\nfor they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall\\nhave been let off easily\\n\\nwhen his letter to mrs weston arrived emma had the perusal of it\\nand she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made\\nher at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she\\nhad undervalued their strength  it was a long wellwritten letter\\ngiving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings\\nexpressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was\\nnatural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local\\nthat could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision\\nno suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the\\nlanguage of real feeling towards mrs weston and the transition\\nfrom highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some\\nof the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on\\nto shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been\\nsaid but for the restraints of proprietythe charm of her own\\nname was not wanting  miss woodhouse appeared more than once\\nand never without a something of pleasing connexion either a\\ncompliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said\\nand in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it\\nwas by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern\\nthe effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment\\nperhaps of all conveyed  compressed into the very lowest vacant\\ncorner were these wordsi had not a spare moment on tuesday\\nas you know for miss woodhouses beautiful little friend  pray make\\nmy excuses and adieus to her  this emma could not doubt was all\\nfor herself  harriet was remembered only from being her friend\\nhis information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor\\nbetter than had been anticipated mrs churchill was recovering\\nand he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for\\ncoming to randalls again\\n\\ngratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the\\nmaterial part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up\\nand returned to mrs weston that it had not added any lasting warmth\\nthat she could still do without the writer and that he must learn\\nto do without her  her intentions were unchanged  her resolution\\nof refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for\\nhis subsequent consolation and happiness  his recollection of harriet\\nand the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend\\nsuggested to her the idea of harriets succeeding her in his affections\\nwas it impossiblenoharriet undoubtedly was greatly his\\ninferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with\\nthe loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner\\nand all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in\\nher favourfor harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed\\n\\ni must not dwell upon it said shei must not think of it\\ni know the danger of indulging such speculations  but stranger\\nthings have happened and when we cease to care for each other\\nas we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort\\nof true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward\\nto with pleasure\\n\\nit was well to have a comfort in store on harriets behalf\\nthough it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil\\nin that quarter was at hand  as frank churchills arrival had\\nsucceeded mr eltons engagement in the conversation of highbury\\nas the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now\\nupon frank churchills disappearance mr eltons concerns were\\nassuming the most irresistible formhis weddingday was named\\nhe would soon be among them again mr elton and his bride\\nthere was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe\\nbefore mr elton and his bride was in every bodys mouth\\nand frank churchill was forgotten  emma grew sick at the sound\\nshe had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr elton\\nand harriets mind she had been willing to hope had been lately\\ngaining strength  with mr westons ball in view at least\\nthere had been a great deal of insensibility to other things\\nbut it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state\\nof composure as could stand against the actual approachnew carriage\\nbellringing and all\\n\\npoor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma\\ncould give  emma felt that she could not do too much for her\\nthat harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience\\nbut it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing\\nany effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions\\nthe same  harriet listened submissively and said it was very true\\nit was just as miss woodhouse describedit was not worth while to\\nthink about themand she would not think about them any longer\\nbut no change of subject could avail and the next halfhour\\nsaw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before\\nat last emma attacked her on another ground\\n\\nyour allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about\\nmr eltons marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can\\nmake me  you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i\\nfell into  it was all my doing i know  i have not forgotten it\\ni assure youdeceived myself i did very miserably deceive you\\nand it will be a painful reflection to me for ever  do not imagine\\nme in danger of forgetting it\\n\\nharriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words\\nof eager exclamation  emma continued\\n\\ni have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less\\ntalk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather\\ni would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important\\nthan my comfort a habit of selfcommand in you a consideration\\nof what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour\\nto avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit\\nand restore your tranquillity  these are the motives which i\\nhave been pressing on you  they are very importantand sorry\\ni am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them\\nmy being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration  i want\\nyou to save yourself from greater pain  perhaps i may sometimes\\nhave felt that harriet would not forget what was dueor rather\\nwhat would be kind by me\\n\\nthis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest\\nthe idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse\\nwhom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while\\nand when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained\\npowerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it\\nvery tolerably\\n\\nyou who have been the best friend i ever had in my life\\nwant gratitude to younobody is equal to youi care for nobody\\nas i do for youoh  miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been\\n\\nsuch expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look\\nand manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet\\nso well nor valued her affection so highly before\\n\\nthere is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she\\nafterwards to herself  there is nothing to be compared to it\\nwarmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner\\nwill beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction\\ni am sure it will  it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear\\nfather so generally belovedwhich gives isabella all her

clearestheaded\\nlongestsighted bestjudging female breathing  oh the coldness\\nof a jane fairfaxharriet is worth a hundred suchand for a wife\\na sensible mans wifeit is invaluable  i mention no names\\nbut happy the man who changes emma for harriet\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiv\\n\\n\\nmrs elton was first seen at church  but though devotion might\\nbe interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew\\nand it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid\\nto settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty\\nor not pretty at all\\n\\nemma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety\\nto make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects\\nand she made a point of harriets going with her that the worst of\\nthe business might be gone through as soon as possible\\n\\nshe could not enter the house again could not be in the same room\\nto which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago\\nto lace up her boot without recollecting  a thousand vexatious\\nthoughts would recur  compliments charades and horrible blunders\\nand it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be\\nrecollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather\\npale and silent  the visit was of course short and there was so\\nmuch embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma\\nwould not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady\\nand on no account to give one beyond the nothingmeaning terms\\nof being elegantly dressed and very pleasing\\n\\nshe did not really like her  she would not be in a hurry to find fault\\nbut she suspected that there was no eleganceease but not elegance\\nshe was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride\\nthere was too much ease  her person was rather good her face\\nnot unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner\\nwere elegant  emma thought at least it would turn out so\\n\\nas for mr elton his manners did not appearbut no she would\\nnot permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners\\nit was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits\\nand a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it\\nthe woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes\\nand the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own\\ngood sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly\\nunlucky poor mr elton was in being in the same room at once with\\nthe woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry\\nand the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him\\nto have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly\\nand as little really easy as could be\\n\\nwell miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted\\nthe house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin\\nwell miss woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her\\nis not she very charming\\n\\nthere was a little hesitation in emmas answer\\n\\noh yesverya very pleasing young woman\\n\\ni think her beautiful quite beautiful\\n\\nvery nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown\\n\\ni am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love\\n\\noh nothere is nothing to surprize one at alla pretty fortune\\nand she came in his way\\n\\ni dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she\\nwas very much attached to him\\n\\nperhaps she might but it is not every mans fate to marry the\\nwoman who loves him best  miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home\\nand thought this the best offer she was likely to have\\n\\nyes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever\\nhave a better  well i wish them happy with all my heart  and now\\nmiss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again\\nhe is just as superior as everbut being married you know\\nit is quite a different thing  no indeed miss woodhouse you need\\nnot be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery\\nto know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort\\nshe does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves\\nhappy creature  he called her augusta  how delightful\\n\\nwhen the visit was returned emma made up her mind  she could then\\nsee more and judge better  from harriets happening not to be\\nat hartfield and her fathers being present to engage mr elton\\nshe had a quarter of an hour of the ladys conversation to herself\\nand could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite\\nconvinced her that mrs elton was a vain woman extremely well\\nsatisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance\\nthat she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which\\nhad been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her\\nnotions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living\\nthat if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would\\ncertainly do mr elton no good\\n\\nharriet would have been a better match  if not wise or refined herself\\nshe would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins\\nit might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best\\nof her own set  the rich brotherinlaw near bristol was the pride\\nof the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride\\nof him\\n\\nthe very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother\\nmr sucklings seata comparison of hartfield to maple grove\\nthe grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the\\nhouse was modern and wellbuilt mrs elton seemed most favourably\\nimpressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she\\ncould see or imagine  very like maple grove indeedshe was quite\\nstruck by the likenessthat room was the very shape and size\\nof the morningroom at maple grove her sisters favourite room\\nmr elton was appealed towas not it astonishingly like\\nshe could really almost fancy herself at maple grove\\n\\nand the staircaseyou know as i came in i observed how very like\\nthe staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house\\ni really could not help exclaiming  i assure you miss woodhouse\\nit is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so\\nextremely partial to as maple grove  i have spent so many happy\\nmonths there with a little sigh of sentiment a charming place\\nundoubtedly  every body who sees it is struck by its beauty\\nbut to me it has been quite a home  whenever you are transplanted\\nlike me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it\\nis to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind\\ni always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony\\n\\nemma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient\\nfor mrs elton who only wanted to be talking herself\\n\\nso extremely like maple grove  and it is not merely the house\\nthe grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly\\nlike  the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here\\nand stand very much in the same wayjust across the lawn\\nand i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it\\nwhich put me so exactly in mind  my brother and sister will be\\nenchanted with this place  people who have extensive grounds\\nthemselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style\\n\\nemma doubted the truth of this sentiment  she had a great idea\\nthat people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little\\nfor the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth\\nwhile to attack an error so doubledyed and therefore only said\\nin reply\\n\\nwhen you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think\\nyou have overrated hartfield  surry is full of beauties\\n\\noh yes i am quite aware of that  it is the garden of england\\nyou know  surry is the garden of england\\n\\nyes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction\\nmany counties i believe are called the garden of england\\nas well as surry\\n\\nno i fancy not replied mrs elton with a most satisfied smile\\ni never heard any county but surry called so\\n\\nemma was silenced\\n\\nmy brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring\\nor summer at farthest continued mrs elton and that will be\\nour time for exploring  while they are with us we shall explore\\na great deal i dare say  they will have their barouchelandau\\nof course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying\\nany thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different\\nbeauties extremely well  they would hardly come in their chaise\\ni think at that season of the year  indeed when the time draws on\\ni shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouchelandau\\nit will be so very much preferable  when people come into a beautiful\\ncountry of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes\\nthem to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond\\nof exploring  we explored to kingsweston twice last summer\\nin that way most delightfully just after their first having the\\nbarouchelandau  you have many parties of that kind here i suppose\\nmiss woodhouse every summer\\n\\nno not immediately here  we are rather out of distance of the very\\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of\\nand we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed\\nto stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure\\n\\nah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort\\nnobody can be more devoted to home than i am  i was quite\\na proverb for it at maple grove  many a time has selina said\\nwhen she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl\\nto move from the house  i absolutely must go in by myself though i\\nhate being stuck up in the barouchelandau without a companion\\nbut augusta i believe with her own goodwill would never stir\\nbeyond the park paling  many a time has she said so and yet i\\nam no advocate for entire seclusion  i think on the contrary\\nwhen people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very\\nbad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\\na proper degree without living in it either too much or too little\\ni perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse\\nlooking towards mr woodhouse your fathers state of health must\\nbe a great drawback  why does not he try bathindeed he should\\nlet me recommend bath to you  i assure you i have no doubt of its doing\\nmr woodhouse good\\n\\nmy father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving\\nany benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown\\nto you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be\\nuseful now\\n\\nah thats a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse\\nwhere the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief\\nthey give  in my bath life i have seen such instances of it\\nand it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of\\nuse to mr woodhouses spirits which i understand are sometimes\\nmuch depressed  and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i\\nneed not take much pains to dwell on them  the advantages of bath\\nto the young are pretty generally understood  it would be a charming\\nintroduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could\\nimmediately secure you some of the best society in the place\\na line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my\\nparticular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided\\nwith when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions\\nand would be the very person for you to go into public with\\n\\nit was as much as emma could bear without being impolite\\nthe idea of her being indebted to mrs elton for what was called\\nan introductionof her going into public under the auspices\\nof a friend of mrs eltonsprobably some vulgar dashing widow\\nwho with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live\\nthe dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed\\n\\nshe restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could\\nhave given and only thanked mrs elton coolly but their going\\nto bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly\\nconvinced that the place might suit her better than her father\\nand then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the\\nsubject directly\\n\\ni do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton  upon these occasions\\na ladys character generally precedes her and highbury has long\\nknown that you are a superior performer\\n\\noh no indeed i must protest against any such idea\\na superior performervery far from it i assure you\\nconsider from how partial a quarter your information came\\ni am doatingly fond of musicpassionately fondand my friends\\nsay i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else\\nupon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree\\nyou miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully  i assure you\\nit has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me\\nto hear what a musical society i am got into  i absolutely cannot\\ndo without music  it is a necessary of life to me and having always\\nbeen used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath\\nit would have been a most serious sacrifice  i honestly said as much\\nto mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing\\nhis fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable\\nand the inferiority of the house tooknowing what i had been\\naccustomed toof course he was not wholly without apprehension\\nwhen he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the\\nworld i could give upparties balls playsfor i had no fear\\nof retirement  blessed with so many resources within myself\\nthe world was not necessary to me  i could do very well without it\\nto those who had no resources it was a different thing but my\\nresources made me quite independent  and as to smallersized rooms\\nthan i had been used to i really could not give it a thought\\ni hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description\\ncertainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i\\ndid assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness\\nnor were spacious apartments  but said i to be quite honest\\ni do not think i can live without something of a musical society\\ni condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank\\nto me\\n\\nwe cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr elton would hesitate\\nto assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury\\nand i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than\\nmay be pardoned in consideration of the motive\\n\\nno indeed i have no doubts at all on that head  i am delighted\\nto find myself in such a circle  i hope we shall have many sweet\\nlittle concerts together  i think miss woodhouse you and i\\nmust establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings\\nat your house or ours  will not it be a good plan  if we\\nexert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies\\nsomething of that nature would be particularly desirable for me\\nas an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know\\nthere is a sad story against them in general  they are but too apt\\nto give up music\\n\\nbut you who are so extremely fond of itthere can\\nbe no danger surely\\n\\ni should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance\\ni tremble  selina has entirely given up musicnever touches\\nthe instrumentthough she played sweetly  and the same may be said\\nof mrs jeffereysclara partridge that wasand of the two milmans\\nnow mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate\\nupon my word it is enough to put one in a fright  i used to be\\nquite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend\\nthat a married woman has many things to call her attention\\ni believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper\\n\\nbut every thing of that kind said emma will soon\\nbe in so regular a train\\n\\nwell said mrs elton laughing we shall see\\n\\nemma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music\\nhad nothing more to say and after a moments pause mrs elton\\nchose another subject\\n\\nwe have been calling at randalls said she and found them\\nboth at home and very pleasant people they seem to be\\ni like them extremely  mr weston seems an excellent creature\\nquite a firstrate favourite with me already i assure you\\nand she appears so truly goodthere is something so motherly\\nand kindhearted about her that it wins upon one directly\\nshe was your governess i think\\n\\nemma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs elton\\nhardly waited for the affirmative before she went on\\n\\nhaving understood as much i was rather astonished to find her\\nso very ladylike  but she is really quite the gentlewoman\\n\\nmrs westons manners said emma were always particularly good\\ntheir propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest\\nmodel for any young woman\\n\\nand who do you think came in while we were there\\n\\nemma was quite at a loss  the tone implied some old acquaintance\\nand how could she possibly guess\\n\\nknightley continued mrs elton knightley himselfwas not\\nit luckyfor not being within when he called the other day\\ni had never seen him before and of course as so particular a\\nfriend of mr es i had a great curiosity  my friend knightley\\nhad been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him\\nand i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not\\nbe ashamed of his friend  knightley is quite the gentleman\\ni like him very much  decidedly i think a very gentlemanlike man\\n\\nhappily it was now time to be gone  they were off and emma\\ncould breathe\\n\\ninsufferable woman was her immediate exclamation  worse than i\\nhad supposed  absolutely insufferable  knightleyi could not\\nhave believed it  knightleynever seen him in her life before\\nand call him knightleyand discover that he is a gentleman\\na little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her caro sposo\\nand her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and\\nunderbred finery  actually to discover that mr knightley is\\na gentleman  i doubt whether he will return the compliment\\nand discover her to be a lady  i could not have believed it\\nand to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club\\none would fancy we were bosom friends  and mrs weston\\nastonished that the person who had brought me up should be\\na gentlewoman  worse and worse  i never met with her equal\\nmuch beyond my hopes  harriet is disgraced by any comparison\\noh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here\\nhow angry and how diverted he would be  ah there i am\\nthinking of him directly  always the first person to be thought of\\nhow i catch myself out  frank churchill comes as regularly into\\nmy mind\\n\\nall this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time\\nher father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons\\ndeparture and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable\\nof attending\\n\\nwell my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw\\nher before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say\\nshe was very much pleased with you  she speaks a little too quick\\na little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear\\nbut i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks\\nlike you and poor miss taylor  however she seems a very obliging\\nprettybehaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife\\nthough i think he had better not have married  i made the best\\nexcuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton\\non this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course\\nof the summer  but i ought to have gone before  not to wait upon\\na bride is very remiss  ah it shews what a sad invalid i am\\nbut i do not like the corner into vicarage lane\\n\\ni dare say your apologies were accepted sir  mr elton knows you\\n\\nyes  but a young ladya bridei ought to have paid my respects\\nto her if possible  it was being very deficient\\n\\nbut my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore\\nwhy should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride\\nit ought to be no recommendation to you  it is encouraging people\\nto marry if you make so much of them\\n\\nno my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would\\nalways wish to pay every proper attention to a ladyand a bride\\nespecially is never to be neglected  more is avowedly due to her\\na bride you know my dear is always the first in company\\nlet the others be who they may\\n\\nwell papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know\\nwhat is  and i should never have expected you to be lending your\\nsanction to such vanitybaits for poor young ladies\\n\\nmy dear you do not understand me  this is a\\nmatter of mere common politeness and goodbreeding\\nand has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry\\n\\nemma had done  her father was growing nervous and could not\\nunderstand her  her mind returned to mrs eltons offences\\nand long very long did they occupy her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xv\\n\\n\\nemma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill\\nopinion of mrs elton  her observation had been pretty correct\\nsuch as mrs elton appeared to her on this second interview\\nsuch she appeared whenever they met againselfimportant presuming\\nfamiliar ignorant and illbred she had a little beauty and a\\nlittle accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself\\ncoming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve\\na country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held\\nsuch a place in society as mrs eltons consequence only could surpass\\n\\nthere was no reason to suppose mr elton thought at all differently\\nfrom his wife  he seemed not merely happy with her but proud\\nhe had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such\\na woman to highbury as not even miss woodhouse could equal\\nand the greater part of her new acquaintance disposed to commend\\nor not in the habit of judging following the lead of miss batess\\ngoodwill or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever\\nand as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied\\nso that mrs eltons praise passed from one mouth to another as it\\nought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her\\nfirst contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very\\npleasant and very elegantly dressed\\n\\nin one respect mrs elton grew even worse than she had appeared\\nat first  her feelings altered towards emmaoffended probably\\nby the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with\\nshe drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold\\nand distant and though the effect was agreeable the illwill\\nwhich produced it was necessarily increasing emmas dislike\\nher manners tooand mr eltons were unpleasant towards harriet\\nthey were sneering and negligent  emma hoped it must rapidly work\\nharriets cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour\\nsunk them both very muchit was not to be doubted that poor\\nharriets attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve\\nand her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable\\nto her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been\\ngiven also  she was of course the object of their joint dislike\\nwhen they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin\\nabusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew\\nin open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous\\ntreatment of harriet\\n\\nmrs elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and from the first\\nnot merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be\\nsupposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she\\nwas not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration\\nbut without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting\\nto assist and befriend herbefore emma had forfeited her confidence\\nand about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs eltons\\nknighterrantry on the subject\\n\\njane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhousei quite\\nrave about jane fairfaxa sweet interesting creature  so

have\\nenjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end  and i think\\nshe feels it  i am sure she does  she is very timid and silent\\none can see that she feels the want of encouragement  i like her\\nthe better for it  i must confess it is a recommendation to me\\ni am a great advocate for timidityand i am sure one does\\nnot often meet with itbut in those who are at all inferior\\nit is extremely prepossessing  oh  i assure you jane fairfax\\nis a very delightful character and interests me more than i\\ncan express\\n\\nyou appear to feel a great dealbut i am not aware how you or any\\nof miss fairfaxs acquaintance here any of those who have known\\nher longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than\\n\\nmy dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare\\nto act  you and i need not be afraid  if we set the example\\nmany will follow it as far as they can though all have not\\nour situations  we have carriages to fetch and convey her home\\nand we live in a style which could not make the addition of\\njane fairfax at any time the least inconvenienti should be\\nextremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner\\nas could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax\\nto partake of it  i have no idea of that sort of thing  it is\\nnot likely that i should considering what i have been used to\\nmy greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the\\nother way in doing too much and being too careless of expense\\nmaple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be\\nfor we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling\\nin incomehowever my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax\\ni shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce\\nher wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents\\nand shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation\\nmy acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt\\nof hearing of something to suit her shortlyi shall introduce her\\nof course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come\\nto us  i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets\\na little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off\\nfor there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is\\nhighly conciliatingi shall have her very often indeed while they\\nare with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in\\nthe barouchelandau in some of our exploring parties\\n\\npoor jane fairfaxthought emmayou have not deserved this\\nyou may have done wrong with

to herselfso disgustingly decorated with a dear miss\\nwoodhouse  the change on mrs eltons side soon afterwards appeared\\nand she was left in peaceneither forced to be the very particular\\nfriend of mrs elton nor under mrs eltons guidance the very\\nactive patroness of jane fairfax and only sharing with others in a\\ngeneral way in knowing what was felt what was meditated what was done\\n\\nshe looked on with some amusementmiss batess gratitude for\\nmrs eltons attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless\\nsimplicity and warmth  she was quite one of her worthies\\nthe most amiable affable delightful womanjust as accomplished\\nand condescending as mrs elton meant to be considered\\nemmas only surprize was that jane fairfax should accept\\nthose attentions and tolerate mrs elton as she seemed to do\\nshe heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons\\nspending a day with the eltons  this was astonishingshe could not\\nhave believed it possible that the taste or the pride of miss fairfax\\ncould endure such society and friendship as the vicarage had to offer\\n\\nshe is a riddle quite a riddle said sheto chuse to remain\\nhere month after month under privations of every sort  and now\\nto chuse the mortification of mrs eltons notice and the penury\\nof her conversation rather than return to the superior companions\\nwho have always loved her with such real generous affection\\n\\njane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells\\nwere gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells\\nhad promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer\\nand fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there\\naccording to miss batesit all came from hermrs dixon had\\nwritten most pressingly  would jane but go

somewhere\\nshe is not to be with the dixons  the decree is issued by somebody\\nbut why must she consent to be with the eltonshere is quite a\\nseparate puzzle\\n\\nupon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject\\nbefore the few who knew her opinion of mrs elton mrs weston\\nventured this apology for jane\\n\\nwe cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage\\nmy dear emmabut it is better than being always at home\\nher aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion\\nmust be very tiresome  we must consider what miss fairfax quits\\nbefore we condemn her taste for what she goes to\\n\\nyou are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax\\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton\\ncould she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have\\nchosen her  but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives\\nattentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her\\n\\nemma felt that mrs weston was giving her a momentary glance\\nand she was herself struck by his warmth  with a faint blush\\nshe presently replied\\n\\nsuch attentions as mrs eltons i should have imagined\\nwould rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax  mrs eltons\\ninvitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting\\n\\ni should not wonder said mrs weston if miss fairfax were to have\\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunts eagerness\\nin accepting mrs eltons civilities for her  poor miss bates may\\nvery likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated\\nin spite of the very natural wish of a little change\\n\\nboth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few\\nminutes silence he said\\n\\nanother thing must be taken into consideration toomrs elton\\ndoes not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her  we all know\\nthe difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest\\nspoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond\\ncommon civility in our personal intercourse with each other\\na something more early implanted  we cannot give any body the\\ndisagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before\\nwe feel things differently  and besides the operation of this\\nas a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes\\nmrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that\\nface to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she\\nhas a claim to  such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell\\nin mrs eltons way beforeand no degree of vanity can prevent\\nher acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not\\nin consciousness\\n\\ni know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma\\nlittle henry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy\\nmade her irresolute what else to say\\n\\nyes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her\\n\\nand yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look\\nbut soon stoppingit was better however to know the worst at once\\nshe hurried onand yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself\\nhow highly it is  the extent of your admiration may take you by\\nsurprize some day or other\\n\\nmr knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\\nleather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together\\nor some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered\\n\\noh are you therebut you are miserably behindhand  mr cole\\ngave me a hint of it six weeks ago\\n\\nhe stoppedemma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston and did\\nnot herself know what to think  in a moment he went on\\n\\nthat will never be however i can assure you  miss fairfax\\ni dare say would not have me if i were to ask herand i am very\\nsure i shall never ask her\\n\\nemma returned her friends pressure with interest and was pleased\\nenough to exclaim\\n\\nyou are not vain mr knightley  i will say that for you\\n\\nhe seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtfuland in a manner\\nwhich shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said\\n\\nso you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax\\n\\nno indeed i have not  you have scolded me too much for matchmaking\\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you  what i said\\njust now meant nothing  one says those sort of things of course\\nwithout any idea of a serious meaning  oh no upon my word i have not\\nthe smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body\\nyou would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way\\nif you were married\\n\\nmr knightley was thoughtful again  the result of his reverie was\\nno emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will\\never take me by surprizei never had a thought of her in that way\\ni assure you  and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming\\nyoung womanbut not even jane fairfax is perfect  she has a fault\\nshe has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife\\n\\nemma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault\\nwell said she and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose\\n\\nyes very soon  he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken\\nhe asked my pardon and said no more  cole does not want to be wiser\\nor wittier than his neighbours\\n\\nin that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser\\nand wittier than all the world  i wonder how she speaks of the coles\\nwhat she calls them  how can she find any appellation for them\\ndeep enough in familiar vulgarity  she calls you knightleywhat can\\nshe do for mr cole  and so i am not to be surprized that jane\\nfairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her\\nmrs weston your argument weighs most with me  i can much more\\nreadily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates\\nthan i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfaxs mind over\\nmrs elton  i have no faith in mrs eltons acknowledging herself\\nthe inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any\\nrestraint beyond her own scanty rule of goodbreeding i cannot\\nimagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\\nwith praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be\\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring\\nher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\\nexploring parties which are to take place in the barouchelandau\\n\\njane fairfax has feeling said mr knightleyi do not\\naccuse her of want of feeling  her sensibilities i suspect\\nare strongand her temper excellent in its power of forbearance\\npatience selfcontroul but it wants openness  she is reserved\\nmore reserved i think than she used to beand i love an\\nopen temper  notill cole alluded to my supposed attachment\\nit had never entered my head  i saw jane fairfax and conversed with\\nher with admiration and pleasure alwaysbut with no thought beyond\\n\\nwell mrs weston said emma triumphantly when he left them\\nwhat do you say now to mr knightleys marrying jane fairfax\\n\\nwhy really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied\\nby the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder\\nif it were to end in his being so at last  do not beat me\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvi\\n\\n\\nevery body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton\\nwas disposed to pay him attention on his marriage  dinnerparties and\\neveningparties were made for him and his lady and invitations\\nflowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending\\nthey were never to have a disengaged day\\n\\ni see how it is said she  i see what a life i am to lead\\namong you  upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated\\nwe really seem quite the fashion  if this is living in the country\\nit is nothing very formidable  from monday next to saturday\\ni assure you we have not a disengaged daya woman with fewer\\nresources than i have need not have been at a loss\\n\\nno invitation came amiss to her  her bath habits made eveningparties\\nperfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste\\nfor dinners  she was a little shocked at the want of two\\ndrawing rooms at the poor attempt at routcakes and there being\\nno ice in the highbury cardparties mrs bates mrs perry\\nmrs goddard and others were a good deal behindhand in knowledge\\nof the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought\\nto be arranged  in the course of the spring she must return their\\ncivilities by one very superior partyin which her cardtables\\nshould be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs\\nin the true styleand more waiters engaged for the evening\\nthan their own establishment could furnish to carry round\\nthe refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order\\n\\nemma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner\\nat hartfield for the eltons  they must not do less than others\\nor she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable\\nof pitiful resentment  a dinner there must be  after emma had\\ntalked about it for ten minutes mr woodhouse felt no unwillingness\\nand only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom\\nof the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding\\nwho should do it for him\\n\\nthe persons to be invited required little thought  besides the eltons\\nit must be the westons and mr knightley so far it was all of course\\nand it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must\\nbe asked to make the eighthbut this invitation was not given\\nwith equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly\\npleased by harriets begging to be allowed to decline it\\nshe would rather not be in his company more than she could help\\nshe was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy\\nwife together without feeling uncomfortable  if miss woodhouse\\nwould not be displeased she would rather stay at home\\nit was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it\\npossible enough for wishing  she was delighted with the fortitude\\nof her little friendfor fortitude she knew it was in her to give\\nup being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the\\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax\\nsince her last conversation with mrs weston and mr knightley\\nshe was more consciencestricken about jane fairfax than she had\\noften beenmr knightleys words dwelt with her  he had said\\nthat jane fairfax received attentions from mrs elton which nobody\\nelse paid her\\n\\nthis is very true said she at least as far as relates to me\\nwhich was all that was meantand it is very shamefulof the same age\\nand always knowing heri ought to have been more her friend\\nshe will never like me now  i have neglected her too long  but i\\nwill shew her greater attention than i have done\\n\\nevery invitation was successful  they were all disengaged and all happy\\nthe preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over\\na circumstance rather unlucky occurred  the two eldest little\\nknightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of\\nsome weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them\\nand staying one whole day at hartfieldwhich one day would be\\nthe very day of this partyhis professional engagements did\\nnot allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were\\ndisturbed by its happening so  mr woodhouse considered eight\\npersons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear\\nand here would be a ninthand emma apprehended that it would\\nbe a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even\\nto hartfield for fortyeight hours without falling in with a dinnerparty\\n\\nshe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself\\nby representing that though he certainly would make them nine\\nyet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be\\nvery immaterial  she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself\\nto have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed\\nto her instead of his brother\\n\\nthe event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma\\njohn knightley came but mr weston was unexpectedly summoned to town\\nand must be absent on the very day  he might be able to join them\\nin the evening but certainly not to dinner  mr woodhouse was quite\\nat ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys\\nand the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate\\nremoved the chief of even emmas vexation\\n\\nthe day came the party were punctually assembled and mr john knightley\\nseemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable\\ninstead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited\\nfor dinner he was talking to miss fairfax  mrs elton as elegant\\nas lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence\\nwanting only to observe enough for isabellas informationbut miss\\nfairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could\\ntalk to her  he had met her before breakfast as he was returning\\nfrom a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning\\nto rain  it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject\\nand he said\\n\\ni hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i\\nam sure you must have been wetwe scarcely got home in time\\ni hope you turned directly\\n\\ni went only to the postoffice said she and reached home\\nbefore the rain was much  it is my daily errand  i always fetch\\nthe letters when i am here  it saves trouble and is a something\\nto get me out  a walk before breakfast does me good\\n\\nnot a walk in the rain i should imagine\\n\\nno but it did not absolutely rain when i set out\\n\\nmr john knightley smiled and replied\\n\\nthat is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six\\nyards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you\\nand henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before\\nthe postoffice has a great charm at one period of our lives\\nwhen you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are\\nnever worth going through the rain for\\n\\nthere was a little blush and then this answer\\n\\ni must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of\\nevery dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply\\ngrowing older should make me indifferent about letters\\n\\nindifferent  oh noi never conceived you could become indifferent\\nletters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very\\npositive curse\\n\\nyou are speaking of letters of business mine are letters\\nof friendship\\n\\ni have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly\\nbusiness you know may bring money but friendship hardly\\never does\\n\\nah you are not serious now  i know mr john knightley too well\\ni am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as\\nany body  i can easily believe that letters are very little to you\\nmuch less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than\\nmyself which makes the difference it is not age but situation\\nyou have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably\\nnever shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections\\na postoffice i think must always have power to draw me out\\nin worse weather than today\\n\\nwhen i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years\\nsaid john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation\\nwhich time usually brings  i consider one as including the other\\ntime will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within\\nthe daily circlebut that is not the change i had in view for you\\nas an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten\\nyears hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have\\n\\nit was kindly said and very far from giving offence  a pleasant\\nthank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip\\na tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh\\nher attention was now claimed by mr woodhouse who being\\naccording to his custom on such occasions making the circle of\\nhis guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies\\nwas ending with herand with all his mildest urbanity said\\n\\ni am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this\\nmorning in the rain  young ladies should take care of themselves\\nyoung ladies are delicate plants  they should take care of their\\nhealth and their complexion  my dear did you change your stockings\\n\\nyes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind\\nsolicitude about me\\n\\nmy dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for\\ni hope your good grandmama and aunt are well  they are some\\nof my very old friends  i wish my health allowed me to be a\\nbetter neighbour  you do us a great deal of honour today i am sure\\nmy daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness\\nand have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield\\n\\nthe kindhearted polite old man might then sit down and feel\\nthat he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy\\n\\nby this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs elton\\nand her remonstrances now opened upon jane\\n\\nmy dear jane what is this i heargoing to the postoffice\\nin the rainthis must not be i assure youyou sad girl\\nhow could you do such a thingit is a sign i was not there\\nto take care of you\\n\\njane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold\\n\\noh do not tell me  you really are a very sad girl and do not\\nknow how to take care of yourselfto the postoffice indeed\\nmrs weston did you ever hear the like  you and i must positively\\nexert our authority\\n\\nmy advice said mrs weston kindly and persuasively i certainly\\ndo feel tempted to give  miss fairfax you must not run such risks\\nliable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought\\nto be particularly careful especially at this time of year\\nthe spring i always think requires more than common care\\nbetter wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters\\nthan run the risk of bringing on your cough again  now do not you\\nfeel that you had  yes i am sure you are much too reasonable\\nyou look as if you would not do such a thing again\\n\\noh she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined\\nmrs elton  we will not allow her to do such a thing again\\nand nodding significantlythere must be some arrangement made\\nthere must indeed  i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches\\nour letters every morning one of our men i forget his name\\nshall inquire for yours too and bring them to you  that will obviate\\nall difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane\\nyou can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation\\n\\nyou are extremely kind said jane but i cannot give up my\\nearly walk  i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can\\ni must walk somewhere and the postoffice is an object and upon\\nmy word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before\\n\\nmy dear jane say no more about it  the thing is determined\\nthat is laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine\\nany thing without the concurrence of my lord and master  you know\\nmrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves\\nbut i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely\\nworn out  if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore\\nconsider that point as settled\\n\\nexcuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent\\nto such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant\\nif the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it\\nalways is when i am not here by my grandmamas\\n\\noh my dear but so much as patty has to doand it is a kindness\\nto employ our men\\n\\njane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead\\nof answering she began speaking again to mr john knightley\\n\\nthe postoffice is a wonderful establishment said she\\nthe regularity and despatch of it  if one thinks of all that it\\nhas to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing\\n\\nit is certainly very well regulated\\n\\nso seldom that any negligence or blunder appears  so seldom\\nthat a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing\\nabout the kingdom is even carried wrongand not one in a million\\ni suppose actually lost  and when one considers the variety\\nof hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered\\nit increases the wonder\\n\\nthe clerks grow expert from habitthey must begin with some\\nquickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them  if you\\nwant any farther explanation continued he smiling they are\\npaid for it  that is the key to a great deal of capacity\\nthe public pays and must be served well\\n\\nthe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual\\nobservations made\\n\\ni have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same\\nsort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the\\nsame master teaches it is natural enough  but for that reason\\ni should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females\\nfor boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble\\ninto any hand they can get  isabella and emma i think do write\\nvery much alike  i have not always known their writing apart\\n\\nyes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness\\ni know what you meanbut emmas hand is the strongest\\n\\nisabella and emma both write beautifully said mr woodhouse\\nand always did  and so does poor mrs westonwith half a sigh\\nand half a smile at her\\n\\ni never saw any gentlemans handwritingemma began looking also\\nat mrs weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs weston was\\nattending to some one elseand the pause gave her time to reflect\\nnow how am i going to introduce himam i unequal to speaking\\nhis name at once before all these people  is it necessary\\nfor me to use any roundabout phraseyour yorkshire friend\\nyour correspondent in yorkshirethat would be the way i suppose\\nif i were very badno i can pronounce his name without the\\nsmallest distress  i certainly get better and betternow for it\\n\\nmrs weston was disengaged and emma began againmr frank churchill\\nwrites one of the best gentlemans hands i ever saw\\n\\ni do not admire it said mr knightley  it is too small\\nwants strength  it is like a womans writing\\n\\nthis was not submitted to by either lady  they vindicated him\\nagainst the base aspersion  no it by no means wanted strength\\nit was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong\\nhad not mrs weston any letter about her to produce  no she had\\nheard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put\\nit away\\n\\nif we were in the other room said emma if i had my writingdesk\\ni am sure i could produce a specimen  i have a note of his\\ndo not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you\\none day\\n\\nhe chose to say he was employed\\n\\nwell well i have that note and can shew it after dinner\\nto convince mr knightley\\n\\noh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill\\nsaid mr knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse\\nhe will of course put forth his best\\n\\ndinner was on tablemrs elton before she could be spoken to\\nwas ready and before mr woodhouse had reached her with his request\\nto be allowed to hand her into the diningparlour was saying\\n\\nmust i go first  i really am ashamed of always leading the way\\n\\njanes solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma\\nshe had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know\\nwhether the wet walk of this morning had produced any  she suspected\\nthat it had that it would not have been so resolutely encountered\\nbut in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear\\nand that it had not been in vain  she thought there was an air\\nof greater happiness than usuala glow both of complexion and spirits\\n\\nshe could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition\\nand the expense of the irish mailsit was at her tongues end\\nbut she abstained  she was quite determined not to utter a word\\nthat should hurt jane fairfaxs feelings and they followed\\nthe other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance\\nof goodwill highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvii\\n\\n\\nwhen the ladies returned to the drawingroom after dinner emma found\\nit hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties\\nwith so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs elton\\nengross jane fairfax and slight herself  she and mrs weston were\\nobliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together\\nmrs elton left them no choice  if jane repressed her for a\\nlittle time she soon began again and though much that passed\\nbetween them was in a halfwhisper especially on mrs eltons side\\nthere was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects\\nthe postofficecatching coldfetching lettersand friendship\\nwere long under discussion

procuring exactly the desirable thing\\n\\ni not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs elton\\nwho can have thought of it as i have done\\n\\nbut you have not seen so much of the world as i have  you do not\\nknow how many candidates there always are for the first situations\\ni saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove\\na cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an

afraid of giving\\nme trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can\\nhardly be more interested about you than i am  i shall write\\nto mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict\\ncharge to be on the lookout for any thing eligible\\n\\nthank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject\\nto her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving\\nany body trouble\\n\\nbut my dear child the time is drawing near here is april\\nand june or say even july is very near with such business\\nto accomplish before us  your inexperience really amuses me\\na situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you\\nis no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moments notice\\nindeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly\\n\\nexcuse me maam but this is by no means my intention i make no\\ninquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends\\nwhen i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid\\nof being

quite shock me if you mean a fling\\nat the slavetrade i assure you mr suckling was always rather\\na friend to the abolition\\n\\ni did not mean i was not thinking of the slavetrade replied jane\\ngovernesstrade i assure you was all that i had in view\\nwidely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on\\nbut as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where\\nit lies  but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices\\nand that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon\\nmeeting with something that would do\\n\\nsomething that would do repeated mrs elton  aye that may\\nsuit your humble ideas of yourselfi know what a modest creature\\nyou are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up\\nwith any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation\\nin a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command\\nthe elegancies of life\\n\\nyou are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent\\nit would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications\\ni think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison\\na gentlemans family is all that i should condition for\\n\\ni know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i\\nshall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will\\nbe quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right\\nto move in the first circle  your musical knowledge alone would\\nentitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like\\nand mix in the family as much as you chosethat isi do not know\\nif you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure\\nbut you sing as well as playyes i really believe you might\\neven without the harp stipulate for what you choseand you must\\nand shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before\\nthe campbells or i have any rest\\n\\nyou may well class the delight the honour and the comfort\\nof such a situation together said jane they are pretty sure\\nto be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing\\nto be attempted at present for me  i am exceedingly obliged to you\\nmrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am\\nquite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer\\nfor two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as\\ni am\\n\\nand i am quite serious too i assure you replied mrs elton gaily\\nin resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends\\nto watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us\\n\\nin this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing\\ntill mr woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change\\nof object and emma heard her saying in the same halfwhisper to jane\\n\\nhere comes this dear old beau of mine i protestonly think of his\\ngallantry in coming away before the other menwhat a dear creature\\nhe isi assure you i like him excessively  i admire all that quaint\\noldfashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease\\nmodern ease often disgusts me  but this good old mr woodhouse\\ni wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner  oh  i assure\\nyou i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous\\ni fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown\\nhow do you like itselinas choicehandsome i think but i\\ndo not know whether it is not overtrimmed i have the greatest\\ndislike to the idea of being overtrimmedquite a horror of finery\\ni must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me\\na bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste\\nis all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely\\npreferable to finery  but i am quite in the minority i believe\\nfew people seem to value simplicity of dressshow and finery\\nare every thing  i have some notion of putting such a trimming\\nas this to my white and silver poplin  do you think it will\\nlook well\\n\\nthe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawingroom\\nwhen mr weston made his appearance among them  he had returned\\nto a late dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over\\nhe had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize\\nbut there was great joy  mr woodhouse was almost as glad to see\\nhim now as he would have been sorry to see him before  john knightley\\nonly was in mute astonishmentthat a man who might have spent\\nhis evening quietly at home after a day of business in london\\nshould set off again and walk half a mile to another mans house\\nfor the sake of being in mixed company till bedtime of finishing\\nhis day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers\\nwas a circumstance to strike him deeply  a man who had been in motion\\nsince eight oclock in the morning and might now have been still\\nwho had been long talking and might have been silent who had been\\nin more than one crowd and might have been alonesuch a man\\nto quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside\\nand on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into\\nthe worldcould he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\\nback his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would\\nprobably prolong rather than break up the party  john knightley\\nlooked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said\\ni could not have believed it even of him\\n\\nmr weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation\\nhe was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all\\nthe right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere\\nfrom home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest\\nand having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner\\nconvincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants\\nhad been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard\\nwas proceeding to a family communication which though principally\\naddressed to mrs weston he had not the smallest doubt of being\\nhighly interesting to every body in the room  he gave her a letter\\nit was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way\\nand had taken the liberty of opening it\\n\\nread it read it said he it will give you pleasure\\nonly a few lineswill not take you long read it to emma\\n\\nthe two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling\\nand talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued\\nbut very audible to every body\\n\\nwell he is coming you see good news i think  well what do\\nyou say to iti always told you he would be here again soon\\ndid not ianne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would\\nnot believe mein town next week you seeat the latest i dare say\\nfor she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is\\nto be done most likely they will be there tomorrow or saturday\\nas to her illness all nothing of course  but it is an excellent\\nthing to have frank among us again so near as town  they will stay\\na good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us\\nthis is precisely what i wanted  well pretty good news is not it\\nhave you finished it  has emma read it all  put it up put it up\\nwe will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not\\ndo now  i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a\\ncommon way\\n\\nmrs weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion\\nher looks and words had nothing to restrain them  she was happy\\nshe knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy\\nher congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak\\nso fluently  she was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings\\nand trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she\\nrather thought was considerable\\n\\nmr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative\\nto want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say\\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already\\n\\nit was well that he took every bodys joy for granted or he\\nmight not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley\\nparticularly delighted  they were the first entitled\\nafter mrs weston and emma to be made happyfrom them he would\\nhave proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation\\nwith john knightley that it would have been too positive\\nan interruption and finding himself close to mrs elton and\\nher attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xviii\\n\\n\\ni hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you\\nsaid mr weston\\n\\nmrs elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\\nher by such a hope smiled most graciously\\n\\nyou have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continued\\nand know him to be my son though he does not bear my name\\n\\noh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance\\ni am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we\\nshall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage\\n\\nyou are very obligingfrank will be extremely happy i am sure\\nhe is to be in town next week if not sooner  we have notice of it\\nin a letter today i met the letters in my way this morning\\nand seeing my sons hand presumed to open itthough it was not directed\\nto meit was to mrs weston  she is his principal correspondent\\ni assure you  i hardly ever get a letter\\n\\nand so you absolutely opened what was directed to her  oh  mr weston\\nlaughing affectedly i must protest against thata most dangerous\\nprecedent indeedi beg you will not let your neighbours follow\\nyour exampleupon my word if this is what i am to expect\\nwe married women must begin to exert ourselvesoh  mr weston\\ni could not have believed it of you\\n\\naye we men are sad fellows  you must take care of yourself\\nmrs eltonthis letter tells usit is a short letterwritten in\\na hurry merely to give us noticeit tells us that they are all\\ncoming up to town directly on mrs churchills accountshe has\\nnot been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her\\nso they are all to move southward without loss of time\\n\\nindeedfrom yorkshire i think  enscombe is in yorkshire\\n\\nyes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london\\na considerable journey\\n\\nyes upon my word very considerable  sixtyfive miles farther\\nthan from maple grove to london  but what is distance mr weston\\nto people of large fortuneyou would be amazed to hear how my brother\\nmr suckling sometimes flies about  you will hardly believe me\\nbut twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again\\nwith four horses\\n\\nthe evil of the distance from enscombe said mr weston is that\\nmrs churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the\\nsofa for a week together  in franks last letter she complained\\nhe said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\\nboth his arm and his uncles this you know speaks a great degree\\nof weaknessbut now she is so impatient to be in town that she\\nmeans to sleep only two nights on the roadso frank writes word\\ncertainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions\\nmrs elton  you must grant me that\\n\\nno indeed i shall grant you nothing  i always take the part\\nof my own sex  i do indeed  i give you noticeyou will find me\\na formidable antagonist on that point  i always stand up for women\\nand i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect\\nto sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchills\\nmaking incredible exertions to avoid it  selina says it is quite\\nhorror to herand i believe i have caught a little of her nicety\\nshe always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution\\ndoes mrs churchill do the same\\n\\ndepend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other\\nfine lady ever did  mrs churchill will not be second to any lady\\nin the land for\\n\\nmrs elton eagerly interposed with\\n\\noh  mr weston do not mistake me  selina is no fine lady\\ni assure you  do not run away with such an idea\\n\\nis not she  then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is\\nas thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld\\n\\nmrs elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly\\nit was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister\\nwas not a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence\\nof itand she was considering in what way she had best retract\\nwhen mr weston went on\\n\\nmrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect\\nbut this is quite between ourselves  she is very fond of frank\\nand therefore i would not speak ill of her  besides she is out of\\nhealth now but that indeed by her own account she has always been\\ni would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much\\nfaith in mrs churchills illness\\n\\nif she is really ill why not go to bath mr westonto bath\\nor to clifton  she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too\\ncold for her  the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe\\nshe has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever\\nwas before and she begins to want change  it is a retired place\\na fine place but very retired\\n\\nayelike maple grove i dare say  nothing can stand more retired from\\nthe road than maple grove  such an immense plantation all round it\\nyou seem shut out from every thingin the most complete retirement\\nand mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina\\nto enjoy that sort of seclusion  or perhaps she may not have\\nresources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life\\ni always say a woman cannot have too many resourcesand i feel\\nvery thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent\\nof society\\n\\nfrank was here in february for a fortnight\\n\\nso i remember to have heard  he will find an addition to the\\nsociety of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume\\nto call myself an addition  but perhaps he may never have heard\\nof there being such a creature in the world\\n\\nthis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by\\nand mr weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed\\n\\nmy dear madam  nobody but yourself could imagine such a\\nthing possible  not heard of youi believe mrs westons\\nletters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton\\n\\nhe had done his duty and could return to his son\\n\\nwhen frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we\\nmight see him again which makes this days news doubly welcome\\nit has been completely unexpected  that is i always had a strong\\npersuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something\\nfavourable would turn upbut nobody believed me  he and mrs weston\\nwere both dreadfully desponding  how could he contrive to come\\nand how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare\\nhim again and so forthi always felt that something would happen\\nin our favour and so it has you see  i have observed mrs elton\\nin the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month\\nthey are sure to mend the next\\n\\nvery true mr weston perfectly true  it is just what i used\\nto say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship\\nwhen because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all\\nthe rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair\\nand exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before\\nhymens saffron robe would be put on for us  oh the pains i have\\nbeen at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views\\nthe carriagewe had disappointments about the carriageone morning\\ni remember he came to me quite in despair\\n\\nshe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and mr weston instantly\\nseized the opportunity of going on\\n\\nyou were mentioning may  may is the very month which mrs churchill\\nis ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place\\nthan enscombein short to spend in london so that we have the\\nagreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring\\nprecisely the season of the year which one should have chosen\\nfor it  days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant\\nalways inviting one out and never too hot for exercise  when he\\nwas here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal\\nof wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know\\nand we could not do half that we intended  now will be the time\\nthis will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton\\nwhether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant\\nexpectation there will be of his coming in today or tomorrow\\nand at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having\\nhim actually in the house  i think it is so  i think it is the\\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight  i hope you\\nwill be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy\\nhe is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy\\nmrs westons partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose\\nmost gratifying to me  she thinks nobody equal to him\\n\\nand i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my\\nopinion will be decidedly in his favour  i have heard so much\\nin praise of mr frank churchillat the same time it is fair\\nto observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves\\nand are by no means implicitly guided by others  i give you notice\\nthat as i find your son so i shall judge of himi am no flatterer\\n\\nmr weston was musing\\n\\ni hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor\\nmrs churchill  if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice\\nbut there are some traits in her character which make it difficult\\nfor me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish\\nyou cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family\\nnor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves\\nthe whole blame of it is to be laid to her  she was the instigator\\nfranks mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her\\nmr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wifes\\nhis is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would\\nharm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome\\nbut her pride is arrogance and insolence  and what inclines one less\\nto bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood  she was nobody\\nwhen he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever\\nsince her being turned into a churchill she has outchurchilld them\\nall in high and mighty claims  but in herself i assure you she is\\nan upstart\\n\\nonly think well that must be infinitely provoking  i have quite\\na horror of upstarts  maple grove has given me a thorough disgust\\nto people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood\\nwho are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs\\nthey give themselves  your description of mrs churchill made me\\nthink of them directly  people of the name of tupman very lately\\nsettled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving\\nthemselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old\\nestablished families  a year and a half is the very utmost that they can\\nhave lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows\\nthey came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much\\nyou know mr weston  one has not great hopes from birmingham\\ni always say there is something direful in the sound  but nothing\\nmore is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things\\ni assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently\\nthink themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens\\nto be one of their nearest neighbours  it is infinitely too bad\\nmr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove\\nand whose father had it before himi believe at leasti am\\nalmost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before\\nhis death\\n\\nthey were interrupted  tea was carrying round and mr weston\\nhaving said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of\\nwalking away\\n\\nafter tea mr and mrs weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse\\nto cards  the remaining five were left to their own powers\\nand emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed\\nlittle disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice\\nwhich nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself\\nin a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent\\n\\nmr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother\\nhe was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with\\n\\nwell emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about\\nthe boys but you have your sisters letter and every thing is\\ndown at full length there we may be sure  my charge would be much\\nmore concise than hers and probably not much in the same spirit\\nall that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them\\nand do not physic them\\n\\ni rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all\\nin my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella\\nand happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic\\n\\nand if you find them troublesome you must send them home again\\n\\nthat is very likely  you think so do not you\\n\\ni hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father\\nor even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements\\ncontinue to increase as much as they have done lately\\n\\nincrease\\n\\ncertainly you must be sensible that the last halfyear has made\\na great difference in your way of life\\n\\ndifference  no indeed i am not\\n\\nthere can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\\nthan you used to be  witness this very time  here am i come\\ndown for only one day and you are engaged with a dinnerparty\\nwhen did it happen before or any thing like it  your neighbourhood\\nis increasing and you mix more with it  a little while ago\\nevery letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties\\ndinners at mr coles or balls at the crown  the difference\\nwhich randalls randalls alone makes in your goingson is very great\\n\\nyes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all\\n\\nvery welland as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less\\ninfluence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma\\nthat henry and john may be sometimes in the way  and if they are\\ni only beg you to send them home\\n\\nno cried mr knightley that need not be the consequence\\nlet them be sent to donwell  i shall certainly be at leisure\\n\\nupon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me  i should like to know\\nhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\\nof the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\\nto attend to the little boys  these amazing engagements of mine\\nwhat have they been  dining once with the colesand having a ball\\ntalked of which never took place  i can understand younodding at\\nmr john knightleyyour good fortune in meeting with so many of\\nyour friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed\\nbut you turning to mr knightley who know how very very seldom\\ni am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a\\nseries of dissipation for me i cannot imagine  and as to my dear\\nlittle boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them\\ni do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley\\nwho is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one\\nand who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling\\nhis accounts\\n\\nmr knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded\\nwithout difficulty upon mrs eltons beginning to talk to him\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvolume iii\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter i\\n\\n\\na very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the\\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill\\nshe was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at\\nall apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him  her own attachment\\nhad really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking of\\nbut if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love\\nof the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment\\nwhich he had taken away it would be very distressing  if a separation\\nof two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils\\nbefore hercaution for him and for herself would be necessary\\nshe did not mean to have her own affections entangled again\\nand it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his\\n\\nshe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration\\nthat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance\\nand yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive\\nshe felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis\\nan event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state\\n\\nit was not very long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen\\nbefore she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchills\\nfeelings  the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had\\nbeen imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards  he rode\\ndown for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came\\nfrom randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all\\nher quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced\\nand how she must act  they met with the utmost friendliness\\nthere could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her\\nbut she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\\nhad done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree\\nshe watched him well  it was a clear thing he was less in love than he\\nhad been  absence with the conviction probably of her indifference\\nhad produced this very natural and very desirable effect\\n\\nhe was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed\\ndelighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories\\nand he was not without agitation  it was not in his calmness that\\nshe read his comparative difference  he was not calm his spirits\\nwere evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him\\nlively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself\\nbut what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a\\nquarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury\\nhe had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed\\nhe had not stopped he would not stop for more than a wordbut he\\nhad the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call\\nand much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off\\nshe had no doubt as to his being less in lovebut neither his\\nagitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure\\nand she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her\\nreturning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself\\nwith her long\\n\\nthis was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days\\nhe was often hoping intending to comebut was always prevented\\nhis aunt could not bear to have him leave her  such was his own account\\nat randalls if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come\\nit was to be inferred that mrs churchills removal to london had\\nbeen of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder\\nthat she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself\\nconvinced of it at randalls  though much might be fancy he could\\nnot doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state\\nof health than she had been half a year ago  he did not believe it\\nto proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove\\nor at least that she might not have many years of existence before her\\nbut he could not be prevailed on by all his fathers doubts to say\\nthat her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong\\nas ever\\n\\nit soon appeared that london was not the place for her  she could\\nnot endure its noise  her nerves were under continual irritation\\nand suffering and by the ten days end her nephews letter to\\nrandalls communicated a change of plan  they were going to remove\\nimmediately to richmond  mrs churchill had been recommended\\nto the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise\\na fancy for the place  a readyfurnished house in a favourite\\nspot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change\\n\\nemma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement\\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two\\nmonths before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends\\nfor the house was taken for may and june  she was told that now\\nhe wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them\\nalmost as often as he could even wish\\n\\nemma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects  he was\\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered\\nshe hoped it was not so  two months must bring it to the proof\\n\\nmr westons own happiness was indisputable  he was quite delighted\\nit was the very circumstance he could have wished for  now it would\\nbe really having frank in their neighbourhood  what were nine miles\\nto a young manan hours ride  he would be always coming over\\nthe difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough\\nto make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing\\nhim never  sixteen milesnay eighteenit must be full eighteen\\nto manchesterstreetwas a serious obstacle  were he ever able\\nto get away the day would be spent in coming and returning\\nthere was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be\\nat enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse\\nbetter than nearer\\n\\none good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal\\nthe ball at the crown  it had not been forgotten before but it had\\nbeen soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day  now however\\nit was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon\\nafter the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank\\nto say that his aunt felt already much better for the change\\nand that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twentyfour\\nhours at any given time induced them to name as early a day as possible\\n\\nmr westons ball was to be a real thing  a very few tomorrows\\nstood between the young people of highbury and happiness\\n\\nmr woodhouse was resigned  the time of year lightened the evil\\nto him  may was better for every thing than february  mrs bates\\nwas engaged to spend the evening at hartfield james had due notice\\nand he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little henry nor dear\\nlittle john would have any thing the matter with them while dear\\nemma were gone\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii\\n\\n\\nno misfortune occurred again to prevent the ball  the day approached\\nthe day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching\\nfrank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls\\nbefore dinner and every thing was safe\\n\\nno second meeting had there yet been between him and emma\\nthe room at the crown was to witness itbut it would be better\\nthan a common meeting in a crowd  mr weston had been so very\\nearnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible\\nafter themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the\\npropriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came\\nthat she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet\\ninterval in the young mans company  she was to convey harriet\\nand they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just\\nsufficiently before them\\n\\nfrank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though\\nhe did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have\\na delightful evening  they all walked about together to see\\nthat every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes\\nwere joined by the contents of another carriage which emma\\ncould not hear the sound of at first without great surprize\\nso unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently\\nfound that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself\\nby particular desire to help mr westons judgment and they were\\nso very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been\\nentreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness\\non the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might\\nsoon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection\\n\\nemma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which\\nmr weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and\\nintimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes\\nwas not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity\\nshe liked his open manners but a little less of openheartedness\\nwould have made him a higher charactergeneral benevolence\\nbut not general friendship made a man what he ought to be\\nshe could fancy such a man  the whole party walked about\\nand looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do\\nformed a sort of halfcircle round the fire to observe in their\\nvarious modes till other subjects were started that though may\\na fire in the evening was still very pleasant\\n\\nemma found that it was not mr westons fault that the number\\nof privy councillors was not yet larger  they had stopped\\nat mrs batess door to offer the use of their carriage\\nbut the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons\\n\\nfrank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness\\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease  he was looking about he was going\\nto the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages\\nimpatient to begin or afraid of being always near her\\n\\nmrs elton was spoken of  i think she must be here soon said he\\ni have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much\\nof her  it cannot be long i think before she comes\\n\\na carriage was heard  he was on the move immediately\\nbut coming back said\\n\\ni am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her  i have never seen\\neither mr or mrs elton  i have no business to put myself forward\\n\\nmr and mrs elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed\\n\\nbut miss bates and miss fairfax said mr weston looking about\\nwe thought you were to bring them\\n\\nthe mistake had been slight  the carriage was sent for them now\\nemma longed to know what franks first opinion of mrs elton\\nmight be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress\\nand her smiles of graciousness  he was immediately qualifying\\nhimself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention\\nafter the introduction had passed\\n\\nin a few minutes the carriage returnedsomebody talked of rain\\ni will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father\\nmiss bates must not be forgotten  and away he went  mr weston\\nwas following but mrs elton detained him to gratify him by her\\nopinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young\\nman himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out\\nof hearing\\n\\na very fine young man indeed mr weston  you know i candidly told\\nyou i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am\\nextremely pleased with himyou may believe me  i never compliment\\ni think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely\\nwhat i like and approveso truly the gentleman without the least\\nconceit or puppyism  you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies\\nquite a horror of them  they were never tolerated at maple grove\\nneither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we\\nused sometimes to say very cutting things  selina who is mild almost\\nto a fault bore with them much better\\n\\nwhile she talked of his son mr westons attention was chained\\nbut when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were\\nladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must\\nhurry away\\n\\nmrs elton turned to mrs weston  i

fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen\\nwalked into the room and mrs elton seemed to think it as much\\nher duty as mrs westons to receive them  her gestures and\\nmovements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma\\nbut her words every bodys words were soon lost under the\\nincessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not\\nfinished her speech under many minutes after her

herself necessarily overhearing the\\ndiscourse of mrs elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little\\nway behind herhe was thoughtful  whether he were overhearing too\\nshe could not determine  after a good many compliments to jane\\non her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken\\nmrs elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself\\nand it was how do you like my gownhow do you like my trimming\\nhow has wright done my hairwith many other relative questions\\nall answered with patient politeness  mrs elton then said\\nnobody can think less of dress in general than i dobut upon such\\nan occasion as this when every bodys eyes are so much upon me\\nand in compliment to the westonswho i have no doubt are giving\\nthis ball chiefly to do me honouri would not wish to be inferior\\nto others  and i see very few pearls in the room except mine\\nso frank churchill is a capital dancer i understandwe shall see\\nif our styles suita fine young man certainly is frank churchill\\ni like him very well\\n\\nat this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could\\nnot but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want\\nto hear moreand the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while\\ntill another suspension brought mrs eltons tones again distinctly\\nforwardmr elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming\\n\\noh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion\\ni was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be\\nimpatient for tidings of us\\n\\njanerepeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and displeasure\\nthat is easybut miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose\\n\\nhow do you like mrs elton said emma in a whisper\\n\\nnot at all\\n\\nyou are ungrateful\\n\\nungratefulwhat do you mean  then changing from a frown to\\na smileno do not tell mei do not want to know what you mean\\nwhere is my fatherwhen are we to begin dancing\\n\\nemma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour\\nhe walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both\\nmr and mrs weston  he had met with them in a little perplexity\\nwhich must be laid before emma  it had just occurred to mrs weston\\nthat mrs elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would\\nexpect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma\\nthat distinctionemma heard the sad truth with fortitude\\n\\nand what are we to do for a proper partner for her said mr weston\\nshe will think frank ought to ask her\\n\\nfrank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise\\nand boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most\\nperfect approbation ofand it then appeared that mrs weston was\\nwanting him to dance with mrs elton himself and that their business\\nwas to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon\\nmr weston and mrs elton led the way mr frank churchill and miss\\nwoodhouse followed  emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton\\nthough she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her\\nit was almost enough to make her think of marrying  mrs elton had\\nundoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified\\nfor though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could\\nnot lose by the change  mr weston might be his sons superior\\nin spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment\\ndelighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming\\nand to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her\\nshe was more disturbed by mr knightleys not dancing than by any\\nthing elsethere he was among the standersby where he ought not\\nto be he ought to be dancingnot classing himself with the husbands\\nand fathers and whistplayers who were pretending to feel an interest\\nin the dance till their rubbers were made upso young as he looked\\nhe could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere\\nthan where he had placed himself  his tall firm upright figure\\namong the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men\\nwas such as emma felt must draw every bodys eyes and excepting her\\nown partner there was not one among the whole row of young men\\nwho could be compared with himhe moved a few steps nearer\\nand those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike\\na manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he\\nbut take the troublewhenever she caught his eye she forced him\\nto smile but in general he was looking grave  she wished he could\\nlove a ballroom better and could like frank churchill better\\nhe seemed often observing her  she must not flatter herself that he\\nthought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour\\nshe did not feel afraid  there was nothing like flirtation between\\nher and her partner  they seemed more like cheerful easy friends\\nthan lovers  that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done\\nwas indubitable\\n\\nthe ball proceeded pleasantly  the anxious cares the incessant\\nattentions of mrs weston were not thrown away  every body\\nseemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball\\nwhich is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be\\nwas repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this\\nof very important very recordable events it was not more productive\\nthan such meetings usually are  there was one however which emma\\nthought something ofthe two last dances before supper were begun\\nand harriet had no partnerthe only young lady sitting down\\nand so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there\\ncould be any one disengaged was the wonderbut emmas wonder\\nlessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about\\nhe would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided\\nshe was sure he would notand she was expecting him every moment to\\nescape into the cardroom\\n\\nescape however was not his plan  he came to the part of the room\\nwhere the sittersby were collected spoke to some and walked about\\nin front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution\\nof maintaining it  he did not omit being sometimes directly\\nbefore miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her\\nemma saw it  she was not yet dancing she was working her way\\nup from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around\\nand by only turning her head a little she saw it all  when she was\\nhalfway up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she\\nwould no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near\\nthat she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took\\nplace between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife\\nwho was standing immediately above her was not only listening also\\nbut even encouraging him by significant glancesthe kindhearted\\ngentle mrs weston had left her seat to join him and say do not\\nyou dance mr elton to which his prompt reply was most readily\\nmrs weston if you will dance with me\\n\\nmeoh noi would get you a better partner than myself\\ni am no dancer\\n\\nif mrs gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure\\ni am surefor though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man\\nand that my dancing days are over it would give me very great\\npleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert\\n\\nmrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady\\ndisengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancingmiss smith\\nmiss smithohi had not observedyou are extremely obliging\\nand if i were not an old married manbut my dancing days are over\\nmrs weston  you will excuse me  any thing else i should be most happy\\nto do at your commandbut my dancing days are over\\n\\nmrs weston said no more and emma could imagine with what\\nsurprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat\\nthis was mr elton the amiable obliging gentle mr elton\\nshe looked round for a moment he had joined mr knightley at a\\nlittle distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation\\nwhile smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife\\n\\nshe would not look again  her heart was in a glow and she feared\\nher face might be as hot\\n\\nin another moment a happier sight caught hermr knightley\\nleading harriet to the setnever had she been more surprized\\nseldom more delighted than at that instant  she was all pleasure\\nand gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be\\nthanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance\\nsaid much as soon as she could catch his eye again\\n\\nhis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it\\nextremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky\\nif it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for\\nthe very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction\\nwhich her happy features announced  it was not thrown away on her\\nshe bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle\\nand was in a continual course of smiles\\n\\nmr elton had retreated into the cardroom looking emma trusted\\nvery foolish  she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife\\nthough growing very like hershe spoke some of her feelings\\nby observing audibly to her partner\\n\\nknightley has taken pity on poor little miss smithvery goodnatured\\ni declare\\n\\nsupper was announced  the move began and miss bates might be\\nheard from that moment without interruption till her being\\nseated at table and taking up her spoon\\n\\njane jane my dear jane where are youhere is your tippet\\nmrs weston begs you to put on your tippet  she says she is afraid\\nthere will be draughts in the passage though every thing

with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat\\nand backgammontea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples\\nand wine before she came away  amazing luck in some of her throws\\nand she inquired a great deal about you how you were amused\\nand who were your partners  oh said i i shall not forestall jane\\ni left her dancing with mr george otway she will love to tell you\\nall about it herself

convinced there were two and there is but one  i never saw any\\nthing equal to the comfort and stylecandles everywherei was telling\\nyou of your grandmama janethere was a little disappointment\\nthe baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know\\nbut there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus\\nbrought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the\\nasparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again  now there\\nis nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus\\nso she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it\\nto any body for fear of its getting round to dear miss woodhouse\\nwho would be so very much concernedwell this is brilliant\\ni am all amazement could not have supposed any thingsuch\\nelegance and profusioni have seen nothing like it since\\nwell where shall we sit where shall we sit  anywhere so that\\njane is not in a draught  where i sit is of no consequence\\noh do you recommend this

soup too  bless me\\ni should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i\\ncannot help beginning\\n\\nemma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till\\nafter supper but when they were all in the ballroom again\\nher eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked\\nhe was warm in his reprobation of mr eltons conduct it had been\\nunpardonable rudeness and mrs eltons looks also received the due\\nshare of censure\\n\\nthey aimed at wounding more than harriet said he  emma why\\nis it that they are your enemies\\n\\nhe looked with smiling penetration and on receiving\\nno answer added she ought not to be angry with you i suspect\\nwhatever he may beto that surmise you say nothing of course\\nbut confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet\\n\\ni did replied emma and they cannot forgive me\\n\\nhe shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it\\nand he only said\\n\\ni shall not scold you  i leave you to your own reflections\\n\\ncan you trust me with such flatterersdoes my vain spirit ever\\ntell me i am wrong\\n\\nnot your vain spirit but your serious spiritif one leads\\nyou wrong i am sure the other tells you of it\\n\\ni do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton\\nthere is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i\\ndid not  and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet\\nit was through a series of strange blunders\\n\\nand in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice\\nto say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for\\nhimselfharriet smith has some firstrate qualities which mrs elton\\nis totally without  an unpretending singleminded artless girl\\ninfinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such\\na woman as mrs elton  i found harriet more conversable than i expected\\n\\nemma was extremely gratifiedthey were interrupted by the bustle\\nof mr weston calling on every body to begin dancing again\\n\\ncome miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing\\ncome emma set your companions the example  every body is lazy\\nevery body is asleep\\n\\ni am ready said emma whenever i am wanted\\n\\nwhom are you going to dance with asked mr knightley\\n\\nshe hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will\\nask me\\n\\nwill you said he offering his hand\\n\\nindeed i will  you have shewn that you can dance and you know we\\nare not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper\\n\\nbrother and sister no indeed\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii\\n\\n\\nthis little explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable\\npleasure  it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball\\nwhich she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoyshe was\\nextremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting\\nthe eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so\\nmuch alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour\\nwas peculiarly gratifying  the impertinence of the eltons which for\\na few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been\\nthe occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked\\nforward to another happy resultthe cure of harriets infatuation\\nfrom harriets manner of speaking of the circumstance before they\\nquitted the ballroom she had strong hopes  it seemed as if her eyes\\nwere suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr elton\\nwas not the superior creature she had believed him  the fever\\nwas over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being\\nquickened again by injurious courtesy  she depended on the evil\\nfeelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed\\nneglect that could be farther requisiteharriet rational\\nfrank churchill not too much in love and mr knightley not\\nwanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her\\n\\nshe was not to see frank churchill this morning  he had told\\nher that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping\\nat hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day\\nshe did not regret it\\n\\nhaving arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all\\nto rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\\nfor the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa\\nwhen the great iron sweepgate opened and two persons entered\\nwhom she had never less expected to see togetherfrank churchill\\nwith harriet leaning on his armactually harrieta moment\\nsufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened\\nharriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her\\nthe iron gates and the frontdoor were not twenty yards asunder\\nthey were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking\\ninto a chair fainted away\\n\\na young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered\\nand surprizes be explained  such events are very interesting\\nbut the suspense of them cannot last long  a few minutes made emma\\nacquainted with the whole\\n\\nmiss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at\\nmrs goddards who had been also at the ball had walked out together\\nand taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public\\nenough for safety had led them into alarmabout half a mile\\nbeyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms\\non each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired\\nand when the young ladies had advanced some way into it\\nthey had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them\\non a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies\\na child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton\\nexcessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet\\nto follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top\\nand made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury\\nbut poor harriet could not follow  she had suffered very much\\nfrom cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank\\nbrought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless\\nand in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged\\nto remain\\n\\nhow the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been\\nmore courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack\\ncould not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a\\ndozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous\\nand impertinent in look though not absolutely in wordmore and\\nmore frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out\\nher purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more\\nor to use her illshe was then able to walk though but slowly\\nand was moving awaybut her terror and her purse were too tempting\\nand she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang\\ndemanding more\\n\\nin this state frank churchill had found her she trembling\\nand conditioning they loud and insolent  by a most fortunate\\nchance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him\\nto her assistance at this critical moment  the pleasantness\\nof the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his\\nhorses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond highbury\\nand happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before\\nof miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had\\nbeen obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes\\nhe was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot\\nwas unseen by the whole party till almost close to them\\nthe terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet\\nwas then their own portion  he had left them completely frightened\\nand harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak\\nhad just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits\\nwere quite overcome  it was his idea to bring her to hartfield\\nhe had thought of no other place\\n\\nthis was the amount of the whole storyof his communication and\\nof harriets as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech\\nhe dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays\\nleft him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give\\nassurance of her safety to mrs goddard and notice of there\\nbeing such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr knightley\\nhe set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter\\nfor her friend and herself\\n\\nsuch an adventure as thisa fine young man and a lovely young\\nwoman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting\\ncertain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain\\nso emma thought at least  could a linguist could a grammarian\\ncould even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their\\nappearance together and heard their history of it without feeling\\nthat circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting\\nto each otherhow much more must an imaginist like herself\\nbe on fire with speculation and foresightespecially with such\\na groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made\\n\\nit was a very extraordinary thing  nothing of the sort had ever\\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory\\nno rencontre no alarm of the kindand now it had happened\\nto the very person and at the very hour when the other very\\nperson was chancing to pass by to rescue herit certainly\\nwas very extraordinaryand knowing as she did the favourable\\nstate of mind of each at this period it struck her the more\\nhe was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself\\nshe just recovering from her mania for mr elton  it seemed as if\\nevery thing united to promise the most interesting consequences\\nit was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly\\nrecommending each to the other\\n\\nin the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him\\nwhile harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror\\nher naivete her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a\\nsensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harriets\\nown account had been given he had expressed his indignation\\nat the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms\\nevery thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled\\nnor assisted  she would not stir a step nor drop a hint\\nno she had had enough of interference  there could be no harm\\nin a scheme a mere passive scheme  it was no more than a wish\\nbeyond it she would on no account proceed\\n\\nemmas first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge\\nof what had passedaware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion\\nbut she soon felt that concealment must be impossible  within half\\nan hour it was known all over highbury  it was the very event\\nto engage those who talk most the young and the low and all\\nthe youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of\\nfrightful news  the last nights ball seemed lost in the gipsies\\npoor mr woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen\\nwould scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go\\nbeyond the shrubbery again  it was some comfort to him that many\\ninquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours\\nknew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith\\nwere coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure\\nof returning for answer that they were all very indifferent\\nwhich though not exactly true for she was perfectly well\\nand harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with\\nshe had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such\\na man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not\\ninvent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message\\n\\nthe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took\\nthemselves off in a hurry  the young ladies of highbury might have\\nwalked again in safety before their panic began and the whole\\nhistory dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma\\nand her nephewsin her imagination it maintained its ground\\nand henry and john were still asking every day for the story of\\nharriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right\\nif she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv\\n\\n\\na very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came\\none morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after\\nsitting down and hesitating thus began\\n\\nmiss woodhouseif you are at leisurei have something that i\\nshould like to tell youa sort of confession to makeand then\\nyou know it will be over\\n\\nemma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak\\nthere was a seriousness in harriets manner which prepared her\\nquite as much as her words for something more than ordinary\\n\\nit is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued\\nto have no reserves with you on this subject  as i am happily\\nquite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you\\nshould have the satisfaction of knowing it  i do not want to say\\nmore than is necessaryi am too much ashamed of having given way\\nas i have done and i dare say you understand me\\n\\nyes said emma i hope i do\\n\\nhow i could so long a time be fancying myself   \\ncried harriet warmly  it seems like madness  i can see nothing\\nat all extraordinary in him nowi do not care whether i meet\\nhim or notexcept that of the two i had rather not see him\\nand indeed i would go any distance round to avoid himbut i do\\nnot envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her\\nas i have done  she is very charming i dare say and all that\\nbut i think her very illtempered and disagreeablei shall never forget\\nher look the other nighthowever i assure you miss woodhouse\\ni wish her no evilno let them be ever so happy together\\nit will not give me another moments pang  and to convince you\\nthat i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroywhat i\\nought to have destroyed long agowhat i ought never to have kept\\ni know that very well blushing as she spokehowever now i\\nwill destroy it alland it is my particular wish to do it\\nin your presence that you may see how rational i am grown\\ncannot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look\\n\\nnot the least in the worlddid he ever give you any thing\\n\\nnoi cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have\\nvalued very much\\n\\nshe held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most\\nprecious treasures on the top  her curiosity was greatly excited\\nharriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience\\nwithin abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridgeware box\\nwhich harriet opened  it was well lined with the softest cotton\\nbut excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of courtplaister\\n\\nnow said harriet you must recollect\\n\\nno indeed i do not\\n\\ndear me  i should not have thought it possible you could forget\\nwhat passed in this very room about courtplaister one of the very\\nlast times we ever met in itit was but a very few days before i\\nhad my sore throatjust before mr and mrs john knightley came\\ni think the very eveningdo not you remember his cutting his finger\\nwith your new penknife and your recommending courtplaister\\nbut as you had none about you and knew i had you desired\\nme to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece\\nbut it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept\\nplaying some time with what was left before he gave it back to me\\nand so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it\\nso i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then\\nas a great treat\\n\\nmy dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face\\nand jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear\\nremember it  aye i remember it all now all except your saving\\nthis relici knew nothing of that till this momentbut the cutting\\nthe finger and my recommending courtplaister and saying i had none\\nabout meoh my sins my sinsand i had plenty all the while in\\nmy pocketone of my senseless tricksi deserve to be under a\\ncontinual blush all the rest of my lifewellsitting down again\\ngo onwhat else\\n\\nand had you really some at hand yourself  i am sure i never\\nsuspected it you did it so naturally\\n\\nand so you actually put this piece of courtplaister by for his sake\\nsaid emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\\nbetween wonder and amusement  and secretly she added to herself\\nlord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton\\na piece of courtplaister that frank churchill had been pulling about\\ni never was equal to this\\n\\nhere resumed harriet turning to her box again here is\\nsomething still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable\\nbecause this is what did really once belong to him which the\\ncourtplaister never did\\n\\nemma was quite eager to see this superior treasure  it was the end\\nof an old pencilthe part without any lead\\n\\nthis was really his said harrietdo not you remember\\none morningno i dare say you do not  but one morningi forget\\nexactly the daybut perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before\\nthat evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocketbook\\nit was about sprucebeer mr knightley had been telling him\\nsomething about brewing sprucebeer and he wanted to put it down\\nbut when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he\\nsoon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another\\nand this was left upon the table as good for nothing  but i kept\\nmy eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never\\nparted with it again from that moment\\n\\ni do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember it\\ntalking about sprucebeeroh yesmr knightley and i both saying we\\nliked it and mr eltons seeming resolved to learn to like it too\\ni perfectly remember itstop mr knightley was standing just here\\nwas not he  i have an idea he was standing just here\\n\\nah  i do not know  i cannot recollectit is very odd\\nbut i cannot recollectmr elton was sitting here i remember\\nmuch about where i am now\\n\\nwell go on\\n\\noh thats all  i have nothing more to shew you or to say\\nexcept that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire\\nand i wish you to see me do it\\n\\nmy poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness\\nin treasuring up these things\\n\\nyes simpleton as i wasbut i am quite ashamed of it now and wish\\ni could forget as easily as i can burn them  it was very wrong\\nof me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married\\ni knew it wasbut had not resolution enough to part with them\\n\\nbut harriet is it necessary to burn the courtplaisteri have\\nnot a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the courtplaister\\nmight be useful\\n\\ni shall be happier to burn it replied harriet  it has\\na disagreeable look to me  i must get rid of every thing\\nthere it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton\\n\\nand when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr churchill\\n\\nshe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\\nalready made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had\\ntold no fortune might be proved to have made harrietsabout a\\nfortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation\\nand quite undesignedly  emma was not thinking of it at the moment\\nwhich made the information she received more valuable\\nshe merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet\\nwhenever you marry i would advise you to do so and soand thought\\nno more of it till after a minutes silence she heard harriet\\nsay in a very serious tone i shall never marry\\n\\nemma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a\\nmoments debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied\\n\\nnever marrythis is a new resolution\\n\\nit is one that i shall never change however\\n\\nafter another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed from\\ni hope it is not in compliment to mr elton\\n\\nmr elton indeed cried harriet indignantlyoh noand emma\\ncould just catch the words so superior to mr elton\\n\\nshe then took a longer time for consideration  should she proceed\\nno farthershould she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing\\nperhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did\\nor perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive\\nharriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing\\nlike such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent\\ndiscussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved\\nshe believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once\\nall that she meant to say and know  plain dealing was always best\\nshe had previously determined how far she would proceed\\non any application of the sort and it would be safer for both\\nto have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed\\nshe was decided and thus spoke\\n\\nharriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning\\nyour resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying\\nresults from an idea that the person whom you might prefer\\nwould be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you\\nis not it so\\n\\noh  miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose\\nindeed i am not so madbut it is a pleasure to me to admire him\\nat a distanceand to think of his infinite superiority to all\\nthe rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration\\nwhich are so proper in me especially\\n\\ni am not at all surprized at you harriet  the service he rendered\\nyou was enough to warm your heart\\n\\nservice oh it was such an inexpressible obligation\\nthe very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time\\nwhen i saw him cominghis noble lookand my wretchedness before\\nsuch a change  in one moment such a change  from perfect misery\\nto perfect happiness\\n\\nit is very natural  it is natural and it is honourable\\nyes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully\\nbut that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise\\ni do not advise you to give way to it harriet  i do not by any\\nmeans engage for its being returned  consider what you are about\\nperhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can\\nat any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded\\nof his liking you  be observant of him  let his behaviour be the\\nguide of your sensations  i give you this caution now because i\\nshall never speak to you again on the subject  i am determined\\nagainst all interference  henceforward i know nothing of the matter\\nlet no name ever pass our lips  we were very wrong before\\nwe will be cautious nowhe is your superior no doubt and there\\ndo seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature\\nbut yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have\\nbeen matches of greater disparity  but take care of yourself\\ni would not have you too sanguine though however it may end\\nbe assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste\\nwhich i shall always know how to value\\n\\nharriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude\\nemma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing\\nfor her friend  its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind\\nand it must be saving her from the danger of degradation\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v\\n\\n\\nin this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened\\nupon hartfield  to highbury in general it brought no material change\\nthe eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings\\nand of the use to be made of their barouchelandau and jane fairfax\\nwas still at her grandmothers and as the return of the campbells\\nfrom ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer\\nfixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer\\nprovided at least she were able to defeat mrs eltons activity\\nin her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful\\nsituation against her will\\n\\nmr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly\\ntaken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike\\nhim more  he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his\\npursuit of emma  that emma was his object appeared indisputable\\nevery thing declared it his own attentions his fathers hints\\nhis motherinlaws guarded silence it was all in unison\\nwords conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story\\nbut while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him\\nover to harriet mr knightley began to suspect him of some inclination\\nto trifle with jane fairfax  he could not understand it but there\\nwere symptoms of intelligence between themhe thought so at least\\nsymptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed\\nhe could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning\\nhowever he might wish to escape any of emmas errors of imagination\\nshe was not present when the suspicion first arose  he was dining\\nwith the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had\\nseen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which\\nfrom the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place\\nwhen he was again in their company he could not help remembering\\nwhat he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it\\nwere like cowper and his fire at twilight\\n\\nmyself creating what i saw\\n\\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something\\nof private liking of private understanding even between frank\\nchurchill and jane\\n\\nhe had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did\\nto spend his evening at hartfield  emma and harriet were going\\nto walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a\\nlarger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their\\nexercise early as the weather threatened rain mr and mrs weston\\nand their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met\\nthey all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it\\nwas exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father\\npressed them all to go in and drink tea with him  the randalls\\nparty agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech\\nfrom miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it\\npossible to accept dear miss woodhouses most obliging invitation\\n\\nas they were turning into the grounds mr perry passed by on horseback\\nthe gentlemen spoke of his horse\\n\\nby the bye said frank churchill to mrs weston presently\\nwhat became of mr perrys plan of setting up his carriage\\n\\nmrs weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he\\never had any such plan\\n\\nnay i had it from you  you wrote me word of it three months ago\\n\\nme impossible\\n\\nindeed you did  i remember it perfectly  you mentioned it as\\nwhat was certainly to be very soon  mrs perry had told somebody\\nand was extremely happy about it  it was owing to her persuasion\\nas she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal\\nof harm  you must remember it now\\n\\nupon my word i never heard of it till this moment\\n\\nnever really neverbless me how could it bethen i must\\nhave dreamt itbut i was completely persuadedmiss smith\\nyou walk as if you were tired  you will not be sorry to find\\nyourself at home\\n\\nwhat is thiswhat is this cried mr weston about perry\\nand a carriage  is perry going to set up his carriage frank\\ni am glad he can afford it  you had it from himself had you\\n\\nno sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it\\nfrom nobodyvery oddi really was persuaded of mrs westons\\nhaving mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago\\nwith all these particularsbut as she declares she never heard\\na syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream  i am\\na great dreamer  i dream of every body at highbury when i am away\\nand when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin\\ndreaming of mr and mrs perry\\n\\nit is odd though observed his father that you should have had such\\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\\nshould be thinking of at enscombe  perrys setting up his carriage\\nand his wifes persuading him to it out of care for his health\\njust what will happen i have no doubt some time or other\\nonly a little premature  what an air of probability sometimes\\nruns through a dream  and at others what a heap of absurdities\\nit is  well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in\\nyour thoughts when you are absent  emma you are a great dreamer\\ni think\\n\\nemma was out of hearing  she had hurried on before her guests\\nto prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach\\nof mr westons hint\\n\\nwhy to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain\\nto be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject\\nthere is no denying that mr frank churchill might havei do not\\nmean to say that he did not dream iti am sure i have sometimes\\nthe oddest dreams in the worldbut if i am questioned about it\\ni must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring\\nfor mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles\\nknew of it as well as ourselvesbut it was quite a secret\\nknown to nobody else and only thought of about three days\\nmrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came\\nto my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she\\nhad prevailed  jane dont you remember grandmamas telling us\\nof it when we got home  i forget where we had been walking to\\nvery likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls\\nmrs perry was always particularly fond of my motherindeed i do\\nnot know who is notand she had mentioned it to her in confidence\\nshe had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not\\nto go beyond  and from that day to this i never mentioned it\\nto a soul that i know of  at the same time i will not positively\\nanswer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do\\nsometimes pop out a thing before i am aware  i am a talker\\nyou know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing\\nescape me which i should not  i am not like jane i wish i were\\ni will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world\\nwhere is sheoh just behind  perfectly remember mrs perrys coming\\nextraordinary dream indeed\\n\\nthey were entering the hall  mr knightleys eyes had preceded\\nmiss batess in a glance at jane  from frank churchills face\\nwhere he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away\\nhe had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind\\nand too busy with her shawl  mr weston had walked in  the two\\nother gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass  mr knightley\\nsuspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye\\nhe seemed watching her intentlyin vain however if it were so\\njane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither\\n\\nthere was no time for farther remark or explanation  the dream must\\nbe borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round\\nthe large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield\\nand which none but emma could have had power to place there and\\npersuade her father to use instead of the smallsized pembroke\\non which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded\\ntea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move\\n\\nmiss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table\\nbehind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken\\naway their alphabetstheir box of letters  it used to stand here\\nwhere is it  this is a sort of dulllooking evening that ought\\nto be treated rather as winter than summer  we had great amusement\\nwith those letters one morning  i want to puzzle you again\\n\\nemma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table\\nwas quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much\\ndisposed to employ as their two selves  they were rapidly forming\\nwords for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled\\nthe quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for\\nmr woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort\\nwhich mr weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily\\noccupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure\\nof the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took\\nup any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it\\n\\nfrank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax  she gave\\na slight glance round the table and applied herself to it\\nfrank was next to emma jane opposite to themand mr knightley\\nso placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much\\nas he could with as little apparent observation  the word\\nwas discovered and with a faint smile pushed away  if meant\\nto be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight\\nshe should have looked on the table instead of looking just across\\nfor it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word\\nand finding out none directly took it up and fell to work\\nshe was sitting by mr knightley and turned to him for help\\nthe word was blunder and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it\\nthere was a blush on janes cheek which gave it a meaning not\\notherwise ostensible  mr knightley connected it with the dream\\nbut how it could all be was beyond his comprehension\\nhow the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been\\nso lain asleep  he feared there must be some decided involvement\\ndisingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn\\nthese letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick\\nit was a childs play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank\\nchurchills part\\n\\nwith great indignation did he continue to observe him with great\\nalarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions\\nhe saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look\\nsly and demure  he saw that emma had soon made it out and found\\nit highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it\\nproper to appear to censure for she said nonsense for shame\\nhe heard frank churchill next say with a glance towards jane\\ni will give it to hershall iand as clearly heard emma\\nopposing it with eager laughing warmth  no no you must not\\nyou shall not indeed\\n\\nit was done however  this gallant young man who seemed to love\\nwithout feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance\\ndirectly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular\\ndegree of sedate civility entreated her to study it  mr knightleys\\nexcessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize\\nevery possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was\\nnot long before he saw it to be dixon  jane fairfaxs perception\\nseemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal\\nto the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters\\nso arranged  she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing\\nherself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her\\nand saying only i did not know that proper names were allowed\\npushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked\\nresolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered\\nher face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned\\ntowards her aunt\\n\\naye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not\\nspoken a wordi was just going to say the same thing  it is time\\nfor us to be going indeed  the evening is closing in and grandmama\\nwill be looking for us  my dear sir you are too obliging\\nwe really must wish you good night\\n\\njanes alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt\\nhad preconceived  she was immediately up and wanting to quit\\nthe table but so many were also moving that she could not get away\\nand mr knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously\\npushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined\\nshe was afterwards looking for her shawlfrank churchill was\\nlooking alsoit was growing dusk and the room was in confusion\\nand how they parted mr knightley could not tell\\n\\nhe remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full\\nof what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist\\nhis observations he mustyes he certainly must as a friend\\nan anxious friendgive emma some hint ask her some question\\nhe could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to\\npreserve her  it was his duty\\n\\npray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement\\nthe poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax\\ni saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very\\nentertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other\\n\\nemma was extremely confused  she could not endure to give him the\\ntrue explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed\\nshe was really ashamed of having ever imparted them\\n\\noh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing\\na mere joke among ourselves\\n\\nthe joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you\\nand mr churchill\\n\\nhe had hoped she would speak again but she did not  she would\\nrather busy herself about any thing than speak  he sat a little\\nwhile in doubt  a variety of evils crossed his mind  interference\\nfruitless interference  emmas confusion and the acknowledged intimacy\\nseemed to declare her affection engaged  yet he would speak\\nhe owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in\\nan unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter\\nany thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause\\n\\nmy dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you\\nthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between\\nthe gentleman and lady we have been speaking of\\n\\nbetween mr frank churchill and miss fairfax  oh yes perfectly\\nwhy do you make a doubt of it\\n\\nhave you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her\\nor that she admired him\\n\\nnever never she cried with a most open eagernessnever for\\nthe twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me\\nand how could it possibly come into your head\\n\\ni have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them\\ncertain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public\\n\\noh you amuse me excessively  i am delighted to find that you\\ncan vouchsafe to let your imagination wanderbut it will not do\\nvery sorry to check you in your first essaybut indeed it will\\nnot do  there is no admiration between them i do assure you\\nand the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some\\npeculiar circumstancesfeelings rather of a totally different nature\\nit is impossible exactly to explainthere is a good deal of\\nnonsense in itbut the part which is capable of being communicated\\nwhich is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or\\nadmiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be\\nthat is i presume it to be so on her side and i can answer for its\\nbeing so on his  i will answer for the gentlemans indifference\\n\\nshe spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction\\nwhich silenced mr knightley  she was in gay spirits and would\\nhave prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars\\nof his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows\\nof a circumstance which highly entertained her  but his gaiety did\\nnot meet hers  he found he could not be useful and his feelings\\nwere too much irritated for talking  that he might not be irritated\\ninto an absolute fever by the fire which mr woodhouses tender\\nhabits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon\\nafterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness\\nand solitude of donwell

could not possibly come till the autumn\\nno such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores\\nat present  in the daily interchange of news they must be again\\nrestricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings\\ncoming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs churchill\\nwhose health seemed every day to supply a different report\\nand the situation of mrs weston whose happiness it was to be hoped\\nmight eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child\\nas that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it\\n\\nmrs elton was very much disappointed  it was the delay of a great\\ndeal of pleasure and parade  her introductions and recommendations\\nmust all wait and every projected party be still only talked of\\nso she thought at firstbut a little consideration convinced\\nher that every thing need not be put off  why should not they\\nexplore to box hill though the sucklings did not come  they could\\ngo there again with them in the autumn  it was settled that they\\nshould go to box hill  that there was to be such a party had been\\nlong generally known  it had even given the idea of another\\nemma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body\\nfound so well worth seeing and she and mr weston had agreed\\nto chuse some fine morning and drive thither  two or three more\\nof the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to\\nbe done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior\\nto the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking\\nand picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings\\n\\nthis was so very well understood between them that emma could\\nnot but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing\\nfrom mr weston that he had been proposing to mrs elton as her\\nbrother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite\\nand go together and that as mrs elton had very readily acceded\\nto it so it was to be if she had no objection  now as her\\nobjection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton\\nof which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth\\nbringing forward againit could not be done without a reproof\\nto him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found\\nherself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she\\nwould have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would\\nprobably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of\\nmrs eltons party  every feeling was offended and the forbearance\\nof her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity\\nin her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr westons temper\\n\\ni am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably\\nbut i thought you would  such schemes as these are nothing\\nwithout numbers  one cannot have too large a party  a large party\\nsecures its own amusement  and she is a goodnatured woman after all\\none could not leave her out\\n\\nemma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private\\n\\nit was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs elton\\nwas growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr weston\\nas to pigeonpies and cold lamb when a lame carriagehorse threw\\nevery thing into sad uncertainty  it might be weeks it might be\\nonly a few days before the horse were useable but no

however if you prefer it  you can borrow mrs coles\\ni would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible\\n\\nthat i am sure you would  indeed i do you justice my good friend\\nunder that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the\\nwarmest heart  as i tell mr e you are a thorough humourist\\nyes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention\\nto me in the whole of this scheme  you have hit upon the very thing\\nto please me\\n\\nmr knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade\\nhe wished to persuade mr woodhouse as well as emma to join the party\\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors\\nto eat would inevitably make him ill  mr woodhouse must not\\nunder the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two\\nspent at donwell be tempted away to his misery\\n\\nhe was invited on good faith  no lurking horrors were to upbraid\\nhim for his easy credulity  he did consent  he had not been\\nat donwell for two years  some very fine morning he and emma\\nand harriet could go very well and he could sit still with\\nmrs weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens\\nhe did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of\\nthe day  he should like to see the old house again exceedingly\\nand should be very happy to meet mr and mrs elton and any other\\nof his neighbourshe could not see any objection at all to his\\nand emmas and harriets going there some very fine morning\\nhe thought it very well done of mr knightley to invite them\\nvery kind and sensiblemuch cleverer than dining outhe was not\\nfond of dining out\\n\\nmr knightley was fortunate in every bodys most ready concurrence\\nthe invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if\\nlike mrs elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular\\ncompliment to themselvesemma and harriet professed very high\\nexpectations of pleasure from it and mr weston unasked\\npromised to get frank over to join them if possible a proof\\nof approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with\\nmr knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad\\nto see him and mr weston engaged to lose no time in writing\\nand spare no arguments to induce him to come\\n\\nin the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party\\nto box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell\\nwas settled for one day and box hill for the nextthe weather\\nappearing exactly right\\n\\nunder a bright midday sun at almost midsummer mr woodhouse\\nwas safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down\\nto partake of this alfresco party and in one of the most\\ncomfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him by a\\nfire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease\\nready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise\\nevery body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves\\nmrs weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired\\nand sit all the time with him remained when all the others\\nwere invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser\\n\\nit was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she\\nwas satisfied of her fathers comfort she was glad to leave him\\nand look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with\\nmore particular observation more exact understanding of a house\\nand grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family\\n\\nshe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance\\nwith the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant\\nas she viewed the respectable size and style of the building\\nits suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered\\nits ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream\\nof which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect\\nhad scarcely a sightand its abundance of timber in rows and avenues\\nwhich neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted upthe house\\nwas larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good\\ndeal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable\\nand one or two handsome roomsit was just what it ought to be\\nand it looked what it wasand emma felt an increasing respect\\nfor it as the residence of a family of such true gentility\\nuntainted in blood and understandingsome faults of temper john\\nknightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably\\nshe had given them neither men nor names nor places that could\\nraise a blush  these were pleasant feelings and she walked

inquire if he were comeand she was a little uneasy\\nshe had some fears of his horse\\n\\nseats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged\\nto overhear what mrs elton and jane fairfax were talking of\\na situation a most desirable situation was in question  mrs elton\\nhad received notice of it that morning and was in raptures\\nit was not with mrs suckling it was not with mrs bragge\\nbut in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them  it was\\nwith a cousin of mrs bragge an acquaintance of mrs suckling\\na lady known at maple grove  delightful charming superior\\nfirst circles spheres lines ranks every thingand mrs elton\\nwas wild to have the offer closed with immediatelyon her side\\nall was warmth energy and triumphand she positively refused\\nto take her friends negative though miss fairfax continued\\nto assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing\\nrepeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before\\nstill mrs elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence\\nby the morrows posthow jane could bear it at all was astonishing\\nto emmashe did look vexed she did speak pointedlyand at last\\nwith a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal\\nshould not they walk  would not mr knightley shew them the gardens\\nall the gardensshe wished to see the whole extentthe pertinacity\\nof her friend seemed more than she could bear\\n\\nit was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered\\ndispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly\\nfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short\\navenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal\\ndistance from the river seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds\\nit led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone\\nwall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection\\nto give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had\\nbeen there  disputable however as might be the taste of such\\na termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view\\nwhich closed it extremely prettythe considerable slope at nearly\\nthe foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper\\nform beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank\\nof considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood\\nand at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered\\nrose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river\\nmaking a close and handsome curve around it\\n\\nit was a sweet viewsweet to the eye and the mind  english verdure\\nenglish culture english comfort seen under a sun bright\\nwithout being oppressive\\n\\nin this walk emma and mr weston found all the others assembled\\nand towards this view she immediately perceived mr knightley\\nand harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way\\nmr knightley and harrietit was an odd teteatete but she was\\nglad to see itthere had been a time when he would have scorned\\nher as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony\\nnow they seemed in pleasant conversation  there had been a time\\nalso when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot\\nso favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not\\nit might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity\\nand beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom\\nand light column of smoke ascendingshe joined them at the wall\\nand found them more engaged in talking than in looking around\\nhe was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc\\nand emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my\\nown concerns  i have a right to talk on such subjects without being\\nsuspected of introducing robert martinshe did not suspect him\\nit was too old a storyrobert martin had probably ceased to think\\nof harrietthey took a few turns together along the walkthe shade\\nwas most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of\\nthe day\\n\\nthe next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat\\nand they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did\\nnot come  mrs weston looked and looked in vain  his father would\\nnot own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could\\nnot be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare\\nhe had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty\\nhis aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting\\nover to themmrs churchills state however as many were ready\\nto remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint\\nher nephew in the most reasonable dependenceand mrs weston\\nwas at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be\\nby some attack of mrs churchill that he was prevented coming\\nemma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration\\nshe behaved very well and betrayed no emotion\\n\\nthe cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more\\nto see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fishponds\\nperhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting\\non the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot\\nand growing cool againmr woodhouse who had already taken\\nhis little round in the highest part of the gardens where no\\ndamps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more\\nand his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs weston\\nmight be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety\\nwhich her spirits seemed to need\\n\\nmr knightley had done all in his power for mr woodhouses\\nentertainment  books of engravings drawers of medals cameos\\ncorals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets\\nhad been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning\\nand the kindness had perfectly answered  mr woodhouse had been\\nexceedingly well amused  mrs weston had been shewing them all to him\\nand now he would shew them all to emmafortunate in having no other\\nresemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw\\nfor he was slow constant and methodicalbefore this second looking\\nover was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake\\nof a few moments free observation of the entrance and groundplot\\nof the houseand was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared\\ncoming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape\\nlittle expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there was a start\\nat first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of\\n\\nwill you be so kind said she when i am missed as to say\\nthat i am gone homei am going this momentmy aunt is not aware\\nhow late it is nor how long we have been absentbut i am sure we\\nshall be wanted and i am determined to go directlyi have

fatiguequick walking will refresh memiss woodhouse we all\\nknow at times what it is to be wearied in spirits  mine i confess\\nare exhausted  the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let\\nme have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary\\n\\nemma had not another word to oppose  she saw it all and entering\\ninto her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately\\nand watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend  her parting\\nlook was gratefuland her parting words oh  miss woodhouse\\nthe comfort of being sometimes aloneseemed to burst from\\nan overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual\\nendurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who\\nloved her best\\n\\nsuch a home indeed such an aunt said emma as she turned back\\ninto the hall again  i do pity you  and the more sensibility\\nyou betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you\\n\\njane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only\\naccomplished some views of st marks place venice when frank\\nchurchill entered the room  emma had not been thinking of him\\nshe had forgotten to think of himbut she was very glad to see him\\nmrs weston would be at ease  the black mare was blameless\\nthey were right who had named mrs churchill as the cause\\nhe had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her\\na nervous seizure which had lasted some hoursand he had quite given\\nup every thought of coming till very lateand had he known how hot\\na ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be\\nhe believed he should not have come at all  the heat was excessive\\nhe had never suffered any thing like italmost wished he had staid\\nat homenothing killed him like heathe could bear any degree of

breaking up\\ni met one as i camemadness in such weatherabsolute madness\\n\\nemma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchills\\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being\\nout of humour  some people were always cross when they were hot\\nsuch might be his constitution and as she knew that eating\\nand drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints\\nshe recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance\\nof every thing in the diningroomand she humanely pointed out\\nthe door\\n\\nnohe should not eat  he was not hungry it would only make\\nhim hotter  in two minutes however he relented in his own favour\\nand muttering something about sprucebeer walked off  emma returned\\nall her attention to her father saying in secret\\n\\ni am glad i have done being in love with him  i should not like a\\nman who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning  harriets sweet\\neasy temper will not mind it\\n\\nhe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came\\nback all the bettergrown quite cooland with good manners\\nlike himselfable to draw a chair close to them take an interest\\nin their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he\\nshould be so late  he was not in his best spirits but seemed\\ntrying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense\\nvery agreeably  they were looking over views in swisserland\\n\\nas soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad said he\\ni shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places\\nyou will have my sketches some time or

returning and all were soon collected\\nwith some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill\\nothers took it very composedly but there was a very general distress\\nand disturbance on miss fairfaxs disappearance being explained\\nthat it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with\\na short final arrangement for the next days scheme they parted\\nfrank churchills little inclination to exclude himself increased\\nso much that his last words to emma were\\n\\nwellif you wish me to stay and join the party i will\\n\\nshe smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from\\nrichmond was to take him back before the following evening\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii\\n\\n\\nthey had a very fine day for box hill and all the other outward\\ncircumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality\\nwere in favour of a pleasant party  mr weston directed the whole\\nofficiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every\\nbody was in good time  emma and harriet went together miss bates\\nand her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback\\nmrs weston remained with mr woodhouse  nothing was wanting\\nbut to be happy when they got there  seven miles were travelled\\nin expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration\\non first arriving but in the general amount of the day there\\nwas deficiency  there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union\\nwhich could not be got over  they separated too much into parties\\nthe eltons walked together mr knightley took charge of miss\\nbates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill\\nand mr weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better  it seemed\\nat first an accidental division but it never materially varied\\nmr and mrs elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix\\nand be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours\\nthat were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation\\nbetween the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any\\ncold collation or any cheerful mr weston to remove\\n\\nat first it was downright dulness to emma  she had never seen frank\\nchurchill so silent and stupid  he said nothing worth hearing\\nlooked without seeingadmired without intelligencelistened without\\nknowing what she said  while he was so dull it was no wonder that\\nharriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable\\n\\nwhen they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better\\nfor frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object\\nevery distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her\\nto amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he\\ncared forand emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered\\nwas gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement\\nthe admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first\\nand most animating period of their acquaintance but which now\\nin her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most\\npeople looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english\\nword but flirtation could very well describe  mr frank churchill\\nand miss woodhouse flirted together excessively  they were laying\\nthemselves open to that very phraseand to having it sent off\\nin a letter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another\\nnot that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity\\nit was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected\\nshe laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him\\nfor his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship\\nadmiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning\\nback her heart  she still intended him for her friend\\n\\nhow much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come today\\nif it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the\\nhappiness of this party  i had quite determined to go away again\\n\\nyes you were very cross and i do not know what about\\nexcept that you were too late for the best strawberries\\ni was a kinder friend than you deserved  but you were humble\\nyou begged hard to be commanded to come\\n\\ndont say i was cross  i was fatigued  the heat overcame me\\n\\nit is hotter today\\n\\nnot to my feelings  i am perfectly comfortable today\\n\\nyou are comfortable because you are under command\\n\\nyour commandyes\\n\\nperhaps i intended you to say so but i meant selfcommand you had\\nsomehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your\\nown management but today you are got back againand as i cannot\\nbe always with you it is best to believe your temper under your\\nown command rather than mine\\n\\nit comes to the same thing  i can have no selfcommand without\\na motive  you order me whether you speak or not  and you can\\nbe always with me  you are always with me\\n\\ndating from three oclock yesterday  my perpetual influence\\ncould not begin earlier or you would not have been so much\\nout of humour before\\n\\nthree oclock yesterday  that is your date  i thought i had seen\\nyou first in february\\n\\nyour gallantry is really unanswerable  but lowering her voice\\nnobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be\\ntalking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people\\n\\ni say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively impudence\\ni saw you first in february  let every body on the hill hear me if\\nthey can  let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking\\non the other  i saw you first in february  and then whispering\\nour companions are excessively stupid  what shall we do to rouse them\\nany nonsense will serve  they shall talk  ladies and gentlemen\\ni am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides\\nto say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of\\n\\nsome laughed and answered goodhumouredly miss bates said a great deal\\nmrs elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouses presiding\\nmr knightleys answer was the most distinct\\n\\nis miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are\\nall thinking of\\n\\noh no nocried emma laughing as carelessly as she could\\nupon no account in the world  it is the very last thing i\\nwould stand the brunt of just now  let me hear any thing rather\\nthan what you are all thinking of  i will not say quite all\\nthere are one or two perhaps glancing at mr weston and harriet\\nwhose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing\\n\\nit is a sort of thing cried mrs elton emphatically\\nwhich i should not have thought myself privileged to\\ninquire into  though perhaps as the chaperon of the party\\ni never was in any circleexploring partiesyoung ladiesmarried women\\n\\nher mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured\\nin reply\\n\\nvery true my love very true  exactly so indeedquite unheard of\\nbut some ladies say any thing  better pass it off as a joke\\nevery body knows what is due to you\\n\\nit will not do whispered frank to emma they are most\\nof them affronted  i will attack them with more address\\nladies and gentlemeni am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she\\nwaives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of\\nand only requires something very entertaining from each of you\\nin a general way  here are seven of you besides myself who she\\nis pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only\\ndemands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose\\nor verse original or repeatedor two things moderately clever\\nor three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily\\nat them all\\n\\noh very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy\\nthree things very dull indeed  that will just do for me you know\\ni shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open\\nmy mouth shant i looking round with the most goodhumoured\\ndependence on every bodys assentdo not you all think i shall\\n\\nemma could not resist\\n\\nah maam but there may be a difficulty  pardon mebut you\\nwill be limited as to numberonly three at once\\n\\nmiss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not\\nimmediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could\\nnot anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her\\n\\nahwellto be sure  yes i see what she means turning to\\nmr knightley and i will try to hold my tongue  i must make\\nmyself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing\\nto an old friend\\n\\ni like your plan cried mr weston  agreed agreed  i will do\\nmy best  i am making a conundrum  how will a conundrum reckon\\n\\nlow i am afraid sir very low answered his sonbut we shall\\nbe indulgentespecially to any one who leads the way\\n\\nno no said emma it will not reckon low  a conundrum of\\nmr westons shall clear him and his next neighbour  come sir\\npray let me hear it\\n\\ni doubt its being very clever myself said mr weston\\nit is too much a matter of fact but here it iswhat two letters\\nof the alphabet are there that express perfection\\n\\nwhat two lettersexpress perfection  i am sure i do not know\\n\\nah you will never guess  you to emma i am certain will\\nnever guessi will tell youm and aemmado you understand\\n\\nunderstanding and gratification came together  it might be a very\\nindifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh\\nat and enjoy in itand so did frank and harrietit did not seem\\nto touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid\\nabout it and mr knightley gravely said\\n\\nthis explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston\\nhas done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every\\nbody else  perfection should not have come quite so soon\\n\\noh for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs elton\\ni really cannot attempti am not at all fond of the sort of thing\\ni had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not\\nat all pleased with  i knew who it came from  an abominable puppy\\nyou know who i mean nodding to her husband these kind of things\\nare very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire\\nbut quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring\\nabout the country in summer  miss woodhouse must excuse me\\ni am not one of those who have witty things at every bodys service\\ni do not pretend to be a wit  i have a great deal of vivacity\\nin my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak\\nand when to hold my tongue  pass us if you please mr churchill\\npass mr e knightley jane and myself  we have nothing clever to say\\nnot one of us\\n\\nyes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of\\nsneering consciousness i have nothing to say that can entertain\\nmiss woodhouse or any other young lady  an old married man\\nquite good for nothing  shall we walk augusta\\n\\nwith all my heart  i am really tired of exploring so long\\non one spot  come jane take my other arm\\n\\njane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off\\nhappy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out\\nof hearinghow well they suit one anothervery luckymarrying as\\nthey did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public placethey only\\nknew each other i think a few weeks in bath  peculiarly lucky\\nfor as to any real knowledge of a persons disposition that bath\\nor any public place can giveit is all nothing there can be\\nno knowledge  it is only by seeing women in their own homes\\namong their own set just as they always are that you can form\\nany just judgment  short of that it is all guess and luck\\nand will generally be illluck how many a man has committed himself\\non a short acquaintance and rued it all the rest of his life\\n\\nmiss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her\\nown confederates spoke now\\n\\nsuch things do occur undoubtedlyshe was stopped by a cough\\nfrank churchill turned towards her to listen\\n\\nyou were speaking said he gravely  she recovered her voice\\n\\ni was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances\\ndo sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them\\nto be very frequent  a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise\\nbut there is generally time to recover from it afterwards  i would\\nbe understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters\\nwhose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance\\nwho will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience\\nan oppression for ever\\n\\nhe made no answer merely looked and bowed in submission and soon\\nafterwards said in a lively tone\\n\\nwell i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever\\ni marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me  will you\\nturning to emma will you chuse a wife for mei am sure i\\nshould like any body fixed on by you  you provide for the family\\nyou know with a smile at his father find some body for me\\ni am in no hurry  adopt her educate her\\n\\nand make her like myself\\n\\nby all means if you can\\n\\nvery well  i undertake the commission  you shall have a charming wife\\n\\nshe must be very lively and have hazle eyes  i care for nothing else\\ni shall go abroad for a couple of yearsand when i return\\ni shall come to you for my wife  remember\\n\\nemma was in no danger of forgetting  it was a commission to touch every\\nfavourite feeling  would not harriet be the very creature described\\nhazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished\\nhe might even have harriet in his thoughts at the moment\\nwho could say  referring the education to her seemed to imply it\\n\\nnow maam said jane to her aunt shall we join mrs elton\\n\\nif you please my dear  with all my heart  i am quite ready\\ni was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well\\nwe shall soon overtake her  there she isno thats somebody else\\nthats one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her\\nwell i declare\\n\\nthey walked off followed in half a minute by mr knightley\\nmr weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young\\nmans spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant  even emma grew\\ntired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather\\nwalking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone\\nand quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful\\nviews beneath her  the appearance of the servants looking out\\nfor them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight\\nand even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart\\nand the solicitude of mrs elton to have her carriage first\\nwere gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was\\nto close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure\\nsuch another scheme composed of so many illassorted people\\nshe hoped never to be betrayed into again\\n\\nwhile waiting for the carriage she found mr knightley by her side\\nhe looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said\\n\\nemma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do\\na privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still\\nuse it  i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance\\nhow could you be so unfeeling to miss bates  how could you be so\\ninsolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation\\nemma i had not thought it possible\\n\\nemma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off\\n\\nnay how could i help saying what i didnobody could have helped it\\nit was not so very bad  i dare say she did not understand me\\n\\ni assure you she did  she felt your full meaning  she has talked\\nof it since  i wish you could have heard how she talked of it\\nwith what candour and generosity  i wish you could have heard her\\nhonouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions\\nas she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father\\nwhen her society must be so irksome\\n\\noh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world\\nbut you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are\\nmost unfortunately blended in her\\n\\nthey are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous\\ni could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous\\nover the good  were she a woman of fortune i would leave every\\nharmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you\\nfor any liberties of manner  were she your equal in situation\\nbut emma consider how far this is from being the case  she is poor\\nshe has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live\\nto old age must probably sink more  her situation should secure\\nyour compassion  it was badly done indeed  you whom she had known\\nfrom an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her\\nnotice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits\\nand the pride of the moment laugh at her humble herand before\\nher niece tooand before others many of whom certainly some\\nwould be entirely guided by your treatment of herthis is not\\npleasant to you emmaand it is very far from pleasant to me\\nbut i must i willi will tell you truths while i can\\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel\\nand trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice\\nthan you can do now\\n\\nwhile they talked they were advancing towards the carriage\\nit was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in\\nhe had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted\\nand her tongue motionless  they were combined only of anger\\nagainst herself mortification and deep concern  she had not\\nbeen able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back\\nfor a moment overcomethen reproaching herself for having taken\\nno leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness\\nshe looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference\\nbut it was just too late  he had turned away and the horses were\\nin motion  she continued to look back but in vain and soon\\nwith what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill\\nand every thing left far behind  she was vexed beyond what could\\nhave been expressedalmost beyond what she could conceal\\nnever had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance\\nin her life  she was most forcibly struck  the truth of this\\nrepresentation there was no denying  she felt it at her heart\\nhow could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates  how could\\nshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued\\nand how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude\\nof concurrence of common kindness\\n\\ntime did not compose her  as she reflected more she seemed\\nbut to feel it more  she never had been so depressed  happily it\\nwas not necessary to speak  there was only harriet who seemed not\\nin spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma\\nfelt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home\\nwithout being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii\\n\\n\\nthe wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emmas thoughts all\\nthe evening  how it might be considered by the rest of the party\\nshe could not tell  they in their different homes and their different\\nways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it\\nwas a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational\\nsatisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection\\nthan any she had ever passed  a whole evening of backgammon with\\nher father was felicity to it  there indeed lay real pleasure\\nfor there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twentyfour\\nto his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree\\nof his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her\\ngeneral conduct be open to any severe reproach  as a daughter\\nshe hoped she was not without a heart  she hoped no one could\\nhave said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your father\\ni must i will tell you truths while i can  miss bates should\\nnever againno never  if attention in future could do away\\nthe past she might hope to be forgiven  she had been often remiss\\nher conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought\\nthan fact scornful ungracious  but it should be so no more\\nin the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the\\nvery next morning and it should be the beginning on her side\\nof a regular equal kindly intercourse\\n\\nshe was just as determined when the morrow came and went early\\nthat nothing might prevent her  it was not unlikely she thought\\nthat she might see mr knightley in her way or perhaps he might\\ncome in while she were paying her visit  she had no objection\\nshe would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly\\nand truly hers  her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she\\nsaw him not\\n\\nthe ladies were all at home  she had never rejoiced at the sound\\nbefore nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs\\nwith any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation\\nor of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule\\n\\nthere was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking\\nshe heard miss batess voice something was to be done in a hurry\\nthe maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased\\nto wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon  the aunt and\\nniece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room  jane she had\\na distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door\\nhad shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear\\ni shall say you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are\\nill enough\\n\\npoor old mrs bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she\\ndid not quite understand what was going on\\n\\ni am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know\\nthey tell me she is well  i dare say my daughter will be here presently\\nmiss woodhouse  i hope you find a chair  i wish hetty had not gone\\ni am very little ablehave you a chair maam do you sit where\\nyou like  i am sure she will be here presently\\n\\nemma seriously hoped she would  she had a moments fear of miss\\nbates keeping away from her  but miss bates soon camevery happy\\nand obligedbut emmas conscience told her that there was not the\\nsame cheerful volubility as beforeless ease of look and manner\\na very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead\\nthe way to a return of old feelings  the touch seemed immediate\\n\\nah  miss woodhouse how kind you arei suppose you have heard\\nand are come to give us joy  this does not seem much like joy\\nindeed in metwinkling away a tear or twobut it will be\\nvery trying for us to part with her after having had her so long\\nand she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning\\nsuch long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell\\nand mrs dixon  my dear said i you will blind yourself\\nfor tears were in her eyes perpetually  one cannot wonder\\none cannot wonder  it is a great change and though she is\\namazingly fortunatesuch a situation i suppose as no young woman\\nbefore ever met with on first going outdo not think us ungrateful\\nmiss woodhouse for such surprising good fortuneagain dispersing\\nher tearsbut poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache\\nshe has  when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel\\nany blessing quite as it may deserve  she is as low as possible\\nto look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she\\nis to have secured such a situation  you will excuse her not\\ncoming to youshe is not ableshe is gone into her own room\\ni want her to lie down upon the bed  my dear said i i shall\\nsay you are laid down upon the bed  but however she is not\\nshe is walking about the room  but now that she has written\\nher letters she says she shall soon be well  she will be extremely\\nsorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will\\nexcuse her  you were kept waiting at the doori was quite ashamed\\nbut somehow there was a little bustlefor it so happened that we\\nhad not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did\\nnot know any body was coming  it is only mrs cole said i\\ndepend upon it  nobody else would come so early  well said she\\nit must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now\\nbut then patty came in and said it was you  oh said i\\nit is miss woodhouse  i am sure you will like to see her\\ni can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away\\nand that was what made us keep you waitingand extremely sorry\\nand ashamed we were  if you must go my dear said i you must\\nand i will say you are laid down upon the bed\\n\\nemma was most sincerely interested  her heart had been long growing\\nkinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted\\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing\\nbut pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\\nsensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very\\nnaturally resolve on seeing mrs cole or any other steady friend\\nwhen she might not bear to see herself  she spoke as she felt\\nwith earnest regret and solicitudesincerely wishing that the\\ncircumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually\\ndetermined on might be as much for miss fairfaxs advantage\\nand comfort as possible  it must be a severe trial to them all\\nshe had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbells return\\n\\nso very kind replied miss bates  but you are always kind\\n\\nthere was no bearing such an always and to break through her\\ndreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of\\n\\nwheremay i askis miss fairfax going\\n\\nto a mrs smallridgecharming womanmost superiorto have\\nthe charge of her three little girlsdelightful children\\nimpossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort\\nif we except perhaps mrs sucklings own family and mrs bragges\\nbut mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very\\nsame neighbourhoodlives only four miles from maple grove\\njane will be only four miles from maple grove\\n\\nmrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes\\n\\nyes our good mrs elton  the most indefatigable true friend\\nshe would not take a denial  she would not let jane say no for\\nwhen jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday\\nthe very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it\\nshe was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the\\nreasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind\\nto close with nothing till colonel campbells return and nothing\\nshould induce her to enter into any engagement at presentand so she\\ntold mrs elton over and over againand i am sure i had no more\\nidea that she would change her mindbut that good mrs elton\\nwhose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did  it is not\\nevery body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did\\nand refuse to take janes answer but she positively declared she\\nwould not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her\\nshe would waitand sure enough yesterday evening it was all\\nsettled that jane should go  quite a surprize to me  i had not\\nthe least ideajane took mrs elton aside and told her at once\\nthat upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridges situation\\nshe had come to the resolution of accepting iti did not know a word\\nof it till it was all settled\\n\\nyou spent the evening with mrs elton\\n\\nyes all of us mrs elton would have us come  it was settled so\\nupon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley\\nyou must all spend your evening with us said shei positively must\\nhave you all come\\n\\nmr knightley was there too was he\\n\\nno not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i\\nthought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let\\nhim off he did notbut my mother and jane and i were all there\\nand a very agreeable evening we had  such kind friends you know\\nmiss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body\\nseemed rather fagged after the mornings party  even pleasure\\nyou know is fatiguingand i cannot say that any of them seemed\\nvery much to have enjoyed it  however i shall always think it\\na very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends\\nwho included me in it\\n\\nmiss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been\\nmaking up her mind the whole day\\n\\ni dare say she had\\n\\nwhenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all\\nher friendsbut i hope her engagement will have every alleviation\\nthat is possiblei mean as to the character and manners of the family\\n\\nthank you dear miss woodhouse  yes indeed there is every thing\\nin the world that can make her happy in it  except the sucklings\\nand bragges there is not such another nursery establishment\\nso liberal and elegant in all mrs eltons acquaintance\\nmrs smallridge a most delightful womana style of living almost\\nequal to maple groveand as to the children except the little\\nsucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet\\nchildren anywhere  jane will be treated with such regard and kindness\\nit will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasureand her salary\\ni really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse\\neven you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that\\nso much could be given to a young person like jane\\n\\nah madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i\\nremember to have been myself i should think five times the amount\\nof what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions\\ndearly earned\\n\\nyou are so noble in your ideas\\n\\nand when is miss fairfax to leave you\\n\\nvery soon very soon indeed thats the worst of it\\nwithin a fortnight  mrs smallridge is in a great hurry  my poor\\nmother does not know how to bear it  so then i try to put it out of\\nher thoughts and say come maam do not let us think about it any more\\n\\nher friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel\\nand mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself\\nbefore their return\\n\\nyes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such\\na situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining\\ni was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying\\nto mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating\\nme upon it  it was before teastayno it could not be before tea\\nbecause we were just going to cardsand yet it was before tea\\nbecause i remember thinkingoh no now i recollect now i have it\\nsomething happened before tea but not that  mr elton was called\\nout of the room before tea old john abdys son wanted to speak\\nwith him  poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk\\nto my poor father twentyseven years and now poor old man he is\\nbedridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints\\ni must go and see him today and so will jane i am sure if she\\ngets out at all  and poor johns son came to talk to mr elton\\nabout relief from the parish he is very well to do himself\\nyou know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing\\nof that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help\\nand so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler\\nhad been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having\\nbeen sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond\\nthat was what happened before tea  it was after tea that jane spoke\\nto mrs elton\\n\\nmiss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly\\nnew this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it\\npossible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars\\nof mr frank churchills going she proceeded to give them all\\nit was of no consequence\\n\\nwhat mr elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the\\naccumulation of the ostlers own knowledge and the knowledge\\nof the servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over\\nfrom richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill\\nwhich messenger however had been no more than was expected\\nand that mr churchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing\\nupon the whole a tolerable account of mrs churchill and only\\nwishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early\\nbut that mr frank churchill having resolved to go home directly\\nwithout waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold\\ntom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the\\nostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace\\nand driving very steady\\n\\nthere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest\\nand it caught emmas attention only as it united with the subject\\nwhich already engaged her mind  the contrast between mrs churchills\\nimportance in the world and jane fairfaxs struck her one was\\nevery thing the other nothingand she sat musing on the difference\\nof womans destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed\\ntill roused by miss batess saying\\n\\naye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte  what is to become\\nof thatvery true  poor dear jane was talking of it just now\\nyou must go said she  you and i must part  you will have no\\nbusiness herelet it stay however said she give it houseroom\\ntill colonel campbell comes back  i shall talk about it to him\\nhe will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties\\nand to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his\\npresent or his daughters\\n\\nnow emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance\\nof all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing\\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been\\nlong enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could\\nventure to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix\\n\\n\\nemmas pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted\\nbut on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her\\nmr knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were\\nsitting with her fathermr knightley immediately got up and in a\\nmanner decidedly graver than usual said\\n\\ni would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare\\nand therefore must now be gone directly  i am going to london\\nto spend a few days with john and isabella  have you any thing to\\nsend or say besides the love which nobody carries\\n\\nnothing at all  but is not this a sudden scheme\\n\\nyesratheri have been thinking of it some little time\\n\\nemma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself\\ntime however she thought would tell him that they ought to be\\nfriends again  while he stood as if meaning to go but not going\\nher father began his inquiries\\n\\nwell my dear and did you get there safelyand how did you\\nfind my worthy old friend and her daughteri dare say they must\\nhave been very much obliged to you for coming  dear emma has been\\nto call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before\\nshe is always so attentive to them\\n\\nemmas colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile\\nand shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr knightley\\nit seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour\\nas if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that had\\npassed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured\\nhe looked at her with a glow of regard  she was warmly gratified\\nand in another moment still more so by a little movement of\\nmore than common friendliness on his parthe took her hand\\nwhether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say\\nshe might perhaps have rather offered itbut he took her hand\\npressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips\\nwhen from some fancy or other he suddenly let it gowhy he should feel\\nsuch a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done\\nshe could not perceivehe would have judged better she thought\\nif he had not stoppedthe intention however was indubitable\\nand whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry\\nor however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more\\nit was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature\\nshe could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction\\nit spoke such perfect amityhe left them immediately afterwards\\ngone in a moment  he always moved with the alertness of a mind which\\ncould neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden\\nthan usual in his disappearance\\n\\nemma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished\\nshe had left her ten minutes earlierit would have been a great\\npleasure to talk over jane fairfaxs situation with mr knightley\\nneither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square\\nfor she knew how much his visit would be enjoyedbut it might have\\nhappened at a better timeand to have had longer notice of it\\nwould have been pleasanterthey parted thorough friends however\\nshe could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance\\nand his unfinished gallantryit was all done to assure her that she\\nhad fully recovered his good opinionhe had been sitting with them\\nhalf an hour she found  it was a pity that she had not come\\nback earlier\\n\\nin the hope of diverting her fathers thoughts from the disagreeableness\\nof mr knightleys going to london and going so suddenly\\nand going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad\\nemma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence\\non the effect was justified it supplied a very useful check\\ninterested without disturbing him  he had long made up his mind to jane\\nfairfaxs going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully\\nbut mr knightleys going to london had been an unexpected blow\\n\\ni am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so\\ncomfortably settled  mrs elton is very goodnatured and agreeable\\nand i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought\\nto be  i hope it is a dry situation and that her health\\nwill be taken good care of  it ought to be a first object\\nas i am sure poor miss taylors always was with me  you know\\nmy dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor\\nwas to us  and i hope she will be better off in one respect\\nand not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long\\n\\nthe following day brought news from richmond to throw every\\nthing else into the background  an express arrived at randalls\\nto announce the death of mrs churchill  though her nephew\\nhad had no particular reason to hasten back on her account\\nshe had not lived above sixandthirty hours after his return\\na sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded\\nby her general state had carried her off after a short struggle\\nthe great mrs churchill was no more\\n\\nit was felt as such things must be felt  every body had a\\ndegree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed\\nsolicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time\\ncuriosity to know where she would be buried  goldsmith tells us\\nthat when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do\\nbut to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally\\nto be recommended as a clearer of illfame mrs churchill\\nafter being disliked at least twentyfive years was now spoken of\\nwith compassionate allowances  in one point she was fully justified\\nshe had never been admitted before to be seriously ill  the event\\nacquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness\\nof imaginary complaints\\n\\npoor mrs churchill no doubt she had been suffering a great deal\\nmore than any body had ever supposedand continual pain would try\\nthe temper  it was a sad eventa great shockwith all her faults\\nwhat would mr churchill do without her  mr churchills loss\\nwould be dreadful indeed  mr churchill would never get over it\\neven mr weston shook his head and looked solemn and said\\nah poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his\\nmourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing\\nand moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense\\ntrue and steady  how it would affect frank was among the earliest\\nthoughts of both  it was also a very early speculation with emma\\nthe character of mrs churchill the grief of her husbandher mind\\nglanced over them both with awe and compassionand then rested\\nwith lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event\\nhow benefited how freed  she saw in a moment all the possible good\\nnow an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter\\nmr churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody\\nan easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew\\nall that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form\\nthe attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel\\nno certainty of its being already formed\\n\\nharriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great selfcommand\\nwhat ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing  emma was\\ngratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character\\nand refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance\\nthey spoke therefore of mrs churchills death with mutual forbearance\\n\\nshort letters from frank were received at randalls communicating\\nall that was immediately important of their state and plans\\nmr churchill was better than could be expected and their\\nfirst removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire\\nwas to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor to whom\\nmr churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years\\nat present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes\\nfor the future were all that could yet be possible on emmas side\\n\\nit was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax\\nwhose prospects were closing while harriets opened and whose\\nengagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished\\nto shew her kindnessand with emma it was grown into a first wish\\nshe had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness\\nand the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now\\nthe very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of\\nregard or sympathy  she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew\\na value for her society and testify respect and consideration\\nshe resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield\\na note was written to urge it  the invitation was refused and by\\na verbal message  miss fairfax was not well enough to write\\nand when mr perry called at hartfield the same morning\\nit appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited\\nthough against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering\\nunder severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made\\nhim doubt the possibility of her going to mrs smallridges at the\\ntime proposed  her health seemed for the moment completely deranged\\nappetite quite goneand though there were no absolutely\\nalarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint\\nwhich was the standing apprehension of the family mr perry was\\nuneasy about her  he thought she had undertaken more than she\\nwas equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would\\nnot own it  her spirits seemed overcome  her present home\\nhe could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorder\\nconfined always to one roomhe could have wished it otherwise\\nand her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge\\nto be not the best companion for an invalid of that description\\nher care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact\\nonly too great  he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more\\nevil than good from them  emma listened with the warmest concern\\ngrieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover\\nsome way of being useful  to take herbe it only an hour\\nor twofrom her aunt to give her change of air and scene\\nand quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two\\nmight do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say\\nin the most feeling language she could command that she would\\ncall for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name\\nmentioning that she had mr perrys decided opinion in favour\\nof such exercise for his patient  the answer was only in this\\nshort note\\n\\nmiss fairfaxs compliments and thanks but is quite unequal\\nto any exercise\\n\\nemma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it\\nwas impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality\\nshewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she\\nmight best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted\\nin spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove\\nto mrs batess in the hope that jane would be induced to join her\\nbut it would not domiss bates came to the carriage door all gratitude\\nand agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of\\nthe greatest serviceand every thing that message could do was tried\\nbut all in vain  miss bates was obliged to return without success\\njane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out\\nseemed to make her worseemma wished she could have seen her\\nand tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish\\nmiss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on\\nno account to let miss woodhouse in  indeed the truth was\\nthat poor dear jane could not bear to see any bodyany body at all\\nmrs elton indeed could not be deniedand mrs cole had made\\nsuch a pointand mrs perry had said so muchbut except them\\njane would really see nobody\\n\\nemma did not want to be classed with the mrs eltons the mrs perrys\\nand the mrs coles who would force themselves anywhere\\nneither could she feel any right of preference herself\\nshe submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther\\nas to her nieces appetite and diet which she longed to be able\\nto assist  on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy\\nand very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing\\nmr perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could\\ncommand and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful\\n\\nemma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an\\nexamination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality\\nwas speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note\\nin half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks\\nfrom miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its\\nbeing sent back it was a thing she could not takeand moreover\\nshe insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing\\n\\nwhen emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering\\nabout the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon\\nof the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal\\nto any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in\\nthe carriage she could have no doubtputting every thing together\\nthat jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her  she was sorry\\nvery sorry  her heart was grieved for a state which seemed\\nbut the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits\\ninconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified\\nher that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed\\nso little worthy as a friend  but she had the consolation of knowing\\nthat her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself\\nthat could mr knightley have been privy to all her attempts\\nof assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart\\nhe would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x\\n\\n\\none morning about ten days after mrs churchills decease\\nemma was called downstairs to mr weston who could not stay\\nfive minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her\\nhe met her at the parlourdoor and hardly asking her how she did\\nin the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say\\nunheard

 she would have\\nordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone\\nand that you knownodding towards her fatherhumphcan you come\\n\\ncertainly  this moment if you please  it is impossible to\\nrefuse what you ask in such a way  but what can be the matter\\nis she really not ill\\n\\ndepend upon mebut ask no more questions  you will know it\\nall in time  the most unaccountable business  but hush hush\\n\\nto guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma\\nsomething really important seemed announced by his looks\\nbut as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy\\nand settling it with her father that she would take her walk now\\nshe and mr weston were soon out of the house together and on\\ntheir way at a quick pace for randalls\\n\\nnowsaid emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates\\nnow mr weston do let me know what has happened\\n\\nno nohe gravely replieddont ask me  i promised my wife\\nto leave it all to her  she will break it to you better than i can\\ndo not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon\\n\\nbreak it to me cried emma standing still with terror\\ngood godmr weston tell me at oncesomething has happened\\nin brunswick square  i know it has  tell me i charge you tell\\nme this moment what it is\\n\\nno indeed you are mistaken\\n\\nmr weston do not trifle with meconsider how many of my dearest\\nfriends are now in brunswick square  which of them is it\\ni charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment\\n\\nupon my word emma\\n\\nyour wordwhy not your honourwhy not say upon your honour\\nthat it has nothing to do with any of them  good heavenswhat can\\nbe to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family\\n\\nupon my honour said he very seriously it does not  it is not\\nin the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name\\nof knightley\\n\\nemmas courage returned and she walked on\\n\\ni was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you\\ni should not have used the expression  in fact it does not concern you\\nit concerns only myselfthat is we hopehumphin short\\nmy dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it\\ni dont say that it is not a disagreeable businessbut things might\\nbe much worseif we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls\\n\\nemma found that she must wait and now it required little effort\\nshe asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy\\nand that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some\\nmoney concernsomething just come to light of a disagreeable\\nnature in the circumstances of the familysomething which the late\\nevent at richmond had brought forward  her fancy was very active\\nhalf a dozen natural children perhapsand poor frank cut off\\nthis though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her\\nit inspired little more than an animating curiosity\\n\\nwho is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded\\nspeaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with\\nany other view\\n\\ni do not knowone of the otwaysnot frankit is not frank\\ni assure you  you will not see him  he is half way to windsor\\nby this time\\n\\nhas your son been with you then\\n\\noh yesdid not you knowwell well never mind\\n\\nfor a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more\\nguarded and demure\\n\\nyes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did\\n\\nthey hurried on and were speedily at randallswell my dear\\nsaid he as they entered the roomi have brought her and now\\ni hope you will soon be better  i shall leave you together\\nthere is no use in delay  i shall not be far off if you want me\\nand emma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he\\nquitted the roomi have been as good as my word  she has not the\\nleast idea\\n\\nmrs weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation\\nthat emmas uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone\\nshe eagerly said\\n\\nwhat is it my dear friend  something of a very unpleasant nature\\ni find has occurreddo let me know directly what it is\\ni have been walking all this way in complete suspense  we both\\nabhor suspense  do not let mine continue longer  it will do you\\ngood to speak of your distress whatever it may be\\n\\nhave you indeed no idea said mrs weston in a trembling voice\\ncannot you my dear emmacannot you form a guess as to what you\\nare to hear\\n\\nso far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess\\n\\nyou are right  it does relate to him and i will tell you directly\\nresuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up\\nhe has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand\\nit is impossible to express our surprize  he came to speak to his\\nfather on a subjectto announce an attachment\\n\\nshe stopped to breathe  emma thought first of herself and then\\nof harriet\\n\\nmore than an attachment indeed resumed mrs weston an engagement\\na positive engagementwhat will you say emmawhat will any\\nbody say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax\\nare engagednay that they have been long engaged\\n\\nemma even jumped with surprizeand horrorstruck exclaimed\\n\\njane fairfaxgood god  you are not serious  you do not mean it\\n\\nyou may well be amazed returned mrs weston still averting her eyes\\nand talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover\\nyou may well be amazed  but it is even so  there has been a solemn\\nengagement between them ever since octoberformed at weymouth\\nand kept a secret from every body  not a creature knowing it\\nbut themselvesneither the campbells nor her family nor his\\nit is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact\\nit is yet almost incredible to myself  i can hardly believe it\\ni thought i knew him\\n\\nemma scarcely heard what was saidher mind was divided between\\ntwo ideasher own former conversations with him about miss fairfax\\nand poor harrietand for some time she could only exclaim\\nand require confirmation repeated confirmation\\n\\nwell said she at last trying to recover herself this is a\\ncircumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i\\ncan at all comprehend it  whatengaged to her all the winter\\nbefore either of them came to highbury\\n\\nengaged since octobersecretly engagedit has hurt me\\nemma very much  it has hurt his father equally  some part\\nof his conduct we cannot excuse\\n\\nemma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend\\nnot to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power\\nbe assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me\\nas you are apprehensive of\\n\\nmrs weston looked up afraid to believe but emmas countenance\\nwas as steady as her words\\n\\nthat you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my\\npresent perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you\\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance\\nwhen i did like him when i was very much disposed to be\\nattached to himnay was attachedand how it came to cease\\nis perhaps the wonder  fortunately however it did cease\\ni have really for some time past for at least these three months\\ncared nothing about him  you may believe me mrs weston\\nthis is the simple truth\\n\\nmrs weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could\\nfind utterance assured her that this protestation had done\\nher more good than any thing else in the world could do\\n\\nmr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she\\non this point we have been wretched  it was our darling wish that you\\nmight be attached to each otherand we were persuaded that it was so\\nimagine what we have been feeling on your account\\n\\ni have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of\\ngrateful wonder to you and myself  but this does not acquit him\\nmrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame\\nwhat right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged\\nand with manners so very disengaged  what right had he to endeavour\\nto please as he certainly didto distinguish any one young woman with\\npersevering attention as he certainly didwhile he really belonged\\nto anotherhow could he tell what mischief he might be doing\\nhow could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him\\nvery wrong very wrong indeed\\n\\nfrom something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine\\n\\nand how could she bear such behaviour  composure with a witness\\nto look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman\\nbefore her face and not resent itthat is a degree of placidity\\nwhich i can neither comprehend nor respect\\n\\nthere were misunderstandings between them emma he said\\nso expressly  he had not time to enter into much explanation\\nhe was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation\\nwhich did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay\\nbut that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said\\nthe present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them\\nand those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the\\nimpropriety of his conduct\\n\\nimpropriety  oh  mrs westonit is too calm a censure\\nmuch much beyond improprietyit has sunk him i cannot say how\\nit has sunk him in my opinion  so unlike what a man should be\\nnone of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth\\nand principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man\\nshould display in every transaction of his life\\n\\nnay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been\\nwrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer\\nfor his having many very many good qualities and\\n\\ngood god cried emma not attending to hermrs smallridge too\\njane actually on the point of going as governess  what could he\\nmean by such horrible indelicacy  to suffer her to engage herself\\nto suffer her even to think of such a measure\\n\\nhe knew nothing about it emma  on this article i can fully\\nacquit him  it was a private resolution of hers not communicated\\nto himor at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction\\ntill yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans\\nthey burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message\\nand it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project\\nof hers which determined him to come forward at once own it\\nall to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short\\nput an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been\\ncarrying on so long\\n\\nemma began to listen better\\n\\ni am to hear from him soon continued mrs weston  he told me\\nat parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which\\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now\\nlet us wait therefore for this letter  it may bring many extenuations\\nit may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are\\nnot to be understood  dont let us be severe dont let us be in\\na hurry to condemn him  let us have patience  i must love him\\nand now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point\\ni am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready\\nto hope that it may  they must both have suffered a great deal\\nunder such a system of secresy and concealment\\n\\nhis sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done\\nhim much harm  well and how did mr churchill take it\\n\\nmost favourably for his nephewgave his consent with scarcely\\na difficulty  conceive what the events of a week have done\\nin that family  while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there\\ncould not have been a hope a chance a possibilitybut scarcely\\nare her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is\\npersuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required\\nwhat a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave\\nhe gave his consent with very little persuasion\\n\\nah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet\\n\\nthis was settled last night and frank was off with the light\\nthis morning  he stopped at highbury at the batess i fancy\\nsome timeand then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get\\nback to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever\\nthat as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour\\nhe was very much agitatedvery much indeedto a degree that made\\nhim appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen\\nhim beforein addition to all the rest there had been the shock of\\nfinding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of\\nand there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal\\n\\nand do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on\\nwith such perfect secresythe campbells the dixons did none\\nof them know of the engagement\\n\\nemma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush\\n\\nnone not one  he positively said that it had been known to no\\nbeing in the world but their two selves\\n\\nwell said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled\\nto the idea and i wish them very happy  but i shall always\\nthink it a very abominable sort of proceeding  what has it been\\nbut a system of hypocrisy and deceitespionage and treachery\\nto come among us with professions of openness and simplicity\\nand such a league in secret to judge us allhere have we been\\nthe whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves\\nall on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the\\nmidst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting\\nin judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both\\nto hearthey must take the consequence if they have heard each\\nother spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable\\n\\ni am quite easy on that head replied mrs weston  i am\\nvery sure that i never said any thing of either to the other\\nwhich both might not have heard\\n\\nyou are in luckyour only blunder was confined to my ear\\nwhen you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady\\n\\ntrue  but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss\\nfairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her\\nand as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe\\n\\nat this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance from the window\\nevidently on the watch  his wife gave him a look which invited\\nhim in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma\\nlet me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his\\nheart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match\\nlet us make the best of itand indeed almost every thing may\\nbe fairly said in her favour  it is not a connexion to gratify\\nbut if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it\\nmay be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean\\nthat he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness\\nof character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for\\nand still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this\\none great deviation from the strict rule of right  and how much\\nmay be said in her situation for even that error\\n\\nmuch indeed cried emma feelingly  if a woman can ever\\nbe excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation\\nlike jane fairfaxsof such one may almost say that the\\nworld is not theirs nor the worlds law\\n\\nshe met mr weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance\\nexclaiming\\n\\na very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word\\nthis was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity\\nand exercise my talent of guessing  but you really frightened me\\ni thought you had lost half your property at least  and here\\ninstead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one\\nof congratulationi congratulate you mr weston with all my heart\\non the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished\\nyoung women in england for your daughter\\n\\na glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was\\nas right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits\\nwas immediate  his air and voice recovered their usual briskness\\nhe shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered\\non the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted\\ntime and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing\\nhis companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence\\nor smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all\\nover together and he had talked it all over again with emma\\nin their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled\\nand not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could\\npossibly have done\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi\\n\\n\\nharriet poor harrietthose were the words in them lay the\\ntormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted\\nthe real misery of the business to her  frank churchill had behaved\\nvery ill by herselfvery ill in many waysbut it was not so much\\nhis behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him\\nit was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriets account\\nthat gave the deepest hue to his offencepoor harriet to be a second\\ntime the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery  mr knightley\\nhad spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been\\nno friend to harriet smithshe was afraid she had done her nothing\\nbut disserviceit was true that she had not to charge herself\\nin this instance as in the former with being the sole and original\\nauthor of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might\\notherwise never have entered harriets imagination for harriet\\nhad acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill\\nbefore she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt\\ncompletely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed\\nshe might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments\\nher influence would have been enough  and now she was very conscious\\nthat she ought to have prevented themshe felt that she had been\\nrisking her friends happiness on most insufficient grounds\\ncommon sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she\\nmust not allow herself to think of him and that there were five\\nhundred chances to one against his ever caring for herbut with\\ncommon sense she added i am afraid i have had little to do\\n\\nshe was extremely angry with herself  if she could not have been\\nangry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful\\nas for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings\\nfrom any present solicitude on her account  harriet would\\nbe anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane\\nwhose troubles and whose illhealth having of course the same origin\\nmust be equally under cureher days of insignificance and evil\\nwere overshe would soon be well and happy and prosperous\\nemma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted\\nthis discovery laid many smaller matters open  no doubt it had been\\nfrom jealousyin janes eyes she had been a rival and well might\\nany thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed\\nan airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack\\nand arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison\\nshe understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself\\nfrom the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged\\nthat jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond\\nher desert  but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge\\nthere was little sympathy to be spared for any body else\\nemma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be\\nmore severe than the first  considering the very superior claims\\nof the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect\\non harriets mind producing reserve and selfcommand it would\\nshe must communicate the painful truth however and as soon\\nas possible  an injunction of secresy had been among mr westons\\nparting words  for the present the whole affair was to be\\ncompletely a secret  mr churchill had made a point of it\\nas a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost\\nand every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum\\nemma had promised but still harriet must be excepted  it was her\\nsuperior duty\\n\\nin spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous\\nthat she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to\\nperform by harriet which mrs weston had just gone through by herself\\nthe intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her\\nshe was now to be anxiously announcing to another  her heart beat\\nquick on hearing harriets footstep and voice so she supposed\\nhad poor mrs weston felt when she was approaching randalls\\ncould the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance\\nbut of that unfortunately there could be no chance\\n\\nwell miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the room\\nis not this the oddest news that ever was\\n\\nwhat news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look\\nor voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint\\n\\nabout jane fairfax  did you ever hear any thing so strange\\nohyou need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has\\ntold me himself  i met him just now  he told me it was to be\\na great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning\\nit to any body but you but he said you knew it\\n\\nwhat did mr weston tell yousaid emma still perplexed\\n\\noh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank\\nchurchill are to be married and that they have been privately\\nengaged to one another this long while  how very odd\\n\\nit was indeed so odd harriets behaviour was so extremely odd\\nthat emma did not know how to understand it  her character appeared\\nabsolutely changed  she seemed to propose shewing no agitation\\nor disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery  emma looked\\nat her quite unable to speak\\n\\nhad you any idea cried harriet of his being in love\\nwith heryou perhaps mightyou blushing as she spoke\\nwho can see into every bodys heart but nobody else\\n\\nupon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent\\ncan you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached\\nto another woman at the very time that i wastacitly if not openly\\nencouraging you to give way to your own feelingsi never had\\nthe slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank\\nchurchills having the least regard for jane fairfax  you may be\\nvery sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly\\n\\nme cried harriet colouring and astonished  why should you\\ncaution meyou do not think i care about mr frank churchill\\n\\ni am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject\\nreplied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there\\nwas a timeand not very distant eitherwhen you gave me reason\\nto understand that you did care about him\\n\\nhimnever never  dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me\\nturning away distressed\\n\\nharriet cried emma after a moments pausewhat do you mean\\ngood heaven what do you meanmistake youam i to suppose then\\n\\nshe could not speak another wordher voice was lost and she\\nsat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer\\n\\nharriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned\\nfrom her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak\\nit was in a voice nearly as agitated as emmas\\n\\ni should not have thought it possible she began that you\\ncould have misunderstood me  i know we agreed never to name him\\nbut considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else\\ni should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed\\nto mean any other person  mr frank churchill indeed  i do not\\nknow who would ever look at him in the company of the other\\ni hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill\\nwho is like nobody by his side  and that you should have been\\nso mistaken is amazingi am sure but for believing that you\\nentirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment\\ni should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost\\nto dare to think of him  at first if you had not told me\\nthat more wonderful things had happened that there had been\\nmatches of greater disparity those were your very words\\ni should not have dared to give way toi should not have thought\\nit possiblebut if you who had been always acquainted with him\\n\\nharriet cried emma collecting herself resolutelylet us\\nunderstand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake\\nare you speaking ofmr knightley\\n\\nto be sure i am  i never could have an idea of any body else\\nand so i thought you knew  when we talked about him it was as clear\\nas possible\\n\\nnot quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that\\nyou then said appeared to me to relate to a different person\\ni could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill\\ni am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you\\nin protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of\\n\\noh  miss woodhouse how you do forget\\n\\nmy dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i\\nsaid on the occasion  i told you that i did not wonder at\\nyour attachment that considering the service he had rendered you\\nit was extremely naturaland you agreed to it expressing yourself\\nvery warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning\\neven what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward\\nto your rescuethe impression of it is strong on my memory\\n\\noh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i\\nwas thinking of something very different at the time  it was not\\nthe gipsiesit was not mr frank churchill that i meant  no with\\nsome elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance\\nof mr knightleys coming and asking me to dance when mr elton\\nwould not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in\\nthe room  that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence\\nand generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel\\nhow superior he was to every other being upon earth\\n\\ngood god cried emma this has been a most unfortunate\\nmost deplorable mistakewhat is to be done\\n\\nyou would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me\\nat least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been\\nif the other had been the person and nowit is possible\\n\\nshe paused a few moments  emma could not speak\\n\\ni do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel\\na great difference between the two as to me or as to any body\\nyou must think one five hundred million times more above me than\\nthe other  but i hope miss woodhouse that supposingthat if\\nstrange as it may appear  but you know they were your own words\\nthat more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity\\nhad taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore\\nit seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before\\nand if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to\\nif mr knightley should reallyif he does not mind the disparity\\ni hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it\\nand try to put difficulties in the way  but you are too good for that\\ni am sure\\n\\nharriet was standing at one of the windows  emma turned round\\nto look at her in consternation and hastily said\\n\\nhave you any idea of mr knightleys returning your affection\\n\\nyes replied harriet modestly but not fearfullyi must say\\nthat i have\\n\\nemmas eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating\\nin a fixed attitude for a few minutes  a few minutes were sufficient\\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart  a mind like hers\\nonce opening to suspicion made rapid progress  she touched\\nshe admittedshe acknowledged the whole truth  why was it\\nso much worse that harriet should be in love with mr knightley\\nthan with frank churchill  why was the evil so dreadfully increased\\nby harriets having some hope of a return  it darted through her\\nwith the speed of an arrow that mr knightley must marry no one\\nbut herself\\n\\nher own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the\\nsame few minutes  she saw it all with a clearness which had\\nnever blessed her before  how improperly had she been acting\\nby harriet  how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational\\nhow unfeeling had been her conduct  what blindness what madness\\nhad led her on  it struck her with dreadful force and she\\nwas ready to give it every bad name in the world  some portion\\nof respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits\\nsome concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice\\nby harrietthere would be no need of compassion to the girl\\nwho believed herself loved by mr knightleybut justice required\\nthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now\\ngave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness\\nwith even apparent kindnessfor her own advantage indeed it was fit\\nthat the utmost extent of harriets hopes should be enquired into\\nand harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest\\nwhich had been so voluntarily formed and maintainedor to deserve\\nto be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right\\nrousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion\\nshe turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed\\nthe conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it\\nthe wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lost\\nneither of them thought but of mr knightley and themselves\\n\\nharriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad\\nto be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge\\nand such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation\\nto give the history of her hopes with great though trembling\\ndelightemmas tremblings as she asked and as she listened\\nwere better concealed than harriets but they were not less\\nher voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation\\nthat such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil\\nsuch a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create\\nshe listened with much inward suffering but with great outward\\npatience to harriets detailmethodical or well arranged\\nor very well delivered it could not be expected to be\\nbut it contained when separated from all the feebleness and\\ntautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit\\nespecially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory\\nbrought in favour of mr knightleys most improved opinion of harriet\\n\\nharriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\\nthose two decisive dancesemma knew that he had on that occasion\\nfound her much superior to his expectation  from that evening\\nor at least from the time of miss woodhouses encouraging her\\nto think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking\\nto her much more than he had been used to do and of his having\\nindeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness\\nand sweetnesslatterly she had been more and more aware of it\\nwhen they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked\\nby her and talked so very delightfullyhe seemed to want to be\\nacquainted with her  emma knew it to have been very much the case\\nshe had often observed the change to almost the same extent\\nharriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him\\nand emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had\\nknown of his opinion of harriet  he praised her for being without\\nart or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings\\nshe knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt\\non them to her more than oncemuch that lived in harriets memory\\nmany little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look\\na speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied\\na preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected\\nby emma  circumstances that might swell to half an hours relation\\nand contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed\\nundiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences\\nto be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not\\nwithout some degree of witness from emma herselfthe first\\nwas his walking with her apart from the others in the limewalk\\nat donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came\\nand he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from\\nthe rest to himselfand at first he had talked to her in a more\\nparticular way than he had ever done before in a very particular\\nway indeedharriet could not recall it without a blush he seemed\\nto be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged\\nbut as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them\\nhe changed the subject and began talking about farming\\nthe second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour\\nbefore emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his\\nbeing at hartfieldthough when he first came in he had said\\nthat he could not stay five minutesand his having told her\\nduring their conversation that though he must go to london\\nit was very much against his inclination that he left home at all\\nwhich was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to her\\nthe superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one\\narticle marked gave her severe pain\\n\\non the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did\\nafter a little

martins interest in view  but harriet rejected\\nthe suspicion with spirit\\n\\nmr martin  no indeedthere was not a hint of mr martin\\ni hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be\\nsuspected of it\\n\\nwhen harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear\\nmiss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope\\n\\ni never should have presumed to think of it at first said she\\nbut for you  you told me to observe him carefully and let\\nhis behaviour be the rule of mineand so i have  but now i seem\\nto feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me\\nit will not be any thing so very wonderful\\n\\nthe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter\\nfeelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emmas side\\nto enable her to say on reply\\n\\nharriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is\\nthe last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman\\nthe idea of his feeling for her more than he really does\\n\\nharriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory\\nand emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at\\nthat moment would have been dreadful penance by the

cared for frank\\nchurchill at all\\n\\nthis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection\\nthis was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry\\nwhich she reached and without

been\\nonly isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she\\nhad always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella\\nshe had herself been first with him for many years past\\nshe had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse\\nslighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of\\nhalf his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not\\nacknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her ownbut still\\nfrom family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind\\nhe had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour\\nto improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no\\nother creature had at all shared  in spite of all her faults\\nshe knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear\\nwhen the suggestions of hope however which must follow here\\npresented themselves she could not presume to indulge them\\nharriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly\\nexclusively

shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates  how directly\\nhow strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subjectnot too\\nstrongly for the offencebut far far too strongly to issue from\\nany feeling softer than upright justice and clearsighted goodwill\\nshe had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could\\nhave that sort of affection for herself which was now in

might at\\nleast be able to ascertain what the chances for it wereshe should\\nsee them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly\\nas she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching\\nshe did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here\\nhe was expected back every day  the power of observation would be\\nsoon givenfrightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts

convinced\\nas long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing\\nharriets confidence  to talk would be only to irritateshe wrote\\nto her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not\\nat present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction\\nthat all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better\\nbe avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before\\nthey met again except in the company of othersshe objected only\\nto a teteatetethey might be able to act as if they had forgotten\\nthe conversation of yesterdayharriet submitted and approved\\nand was grateful\\n\\nthis point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emmas\\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them\\nsleeping or waking the last twentyfour hoursmrs weston who had\\nbeen calling on her daughterinlaw elect and took hartfield in her\\nway home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself\\nto relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview\\n\\nmr weston had accompanied her to mrs batess and gone through his\\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely but she having\\nthen induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned\\nwith much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction\\nthan a quarter of an hour spent in mrs batess parlour with all\\nthe encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded\\n\\na little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while\\nher friend related  mrs weston had set off to pay the visit\\nin a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had\\nwished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write\\nto miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till\\na little time had passed and mr churchill could be reconciled\\nto the engagements becoming known as considering every thing\\nshe thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports\\nbut mr weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious\\nto shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not\\nconceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were\\nthat it would be of any consequence for such things he observed\\nalways got about  emma smiled and felt that mr weston had\\nvery good reason for saying so  they had gone in shortand very\\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady\\nshe had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action\\nhad shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness  the quiet\\nheartfelt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight\\nof her daughterwho proved even too joyous to talk as usual\\nhad been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene  they were\\nboth so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested\\nin every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body\\nand so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work\\nfor them  miss fairfaxs recent illness had offered a fair plea\\nfor mrs weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and\\ndeclined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the\\ncourse of their drive mrs weston had by gentle encouragement\\novercome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse\\non the important subject  apologies for her seemingly ungracious\\nsilence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the\\ngratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr weston\\nmust necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by\\nthey had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state\\nof the engagement  mrs weston was convinced that such conversation\\nmust be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own\\nmind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased\\nwith all that she had said on the subject\\n\\non the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment\\nof so many months continued mrs weston she was energetic\\nthis was one of her expressions  i will not say that since i\\nentered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments but i\\ncan say that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour\\nand the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation\\nthat i felt at my heart\\n\\npoor girl said emma  she thinks herself wrong then for having\\nconsented to a private engagement\\n\\nwrong  no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed\\nto blame herself  the consequence said she has been a state\\nof perpetual suffering to me and so it ought  but after all the\\npunishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct\\npain is no expiation  i never can be blameless  i have been acting\\ncontrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every\\nthing has taken and the kindness i am now receiving is what my\\nconscience tells me ought not to be  do not imagine madam\\nshe continued that i was taught wrong  do not let any reflection\\nfall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought\\nme up  the error has been all my own and i do assure you that\\nwith all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give\\ni shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell\\n\\npoor girl said emma again  she loves him then excessively\\ni suppose  it must have been from attachment only that she could\\nbe led to form the engagement  her affection must have overpowered\\nher judgment\\n\\nyes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him\\n\\ni am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have\\ncontributed to make her unhappy\\n\\non your side my love it was very innocently done  but she\\nprobably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding\\nto the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before\\none natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in\\nshe said was that of making her unreasonable  the consciousness\\nof having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes\\nand made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been\\nthat had beenhard for him to bear  i did not make the allowances\\nsaid she which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits\\nhis delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness\\nof disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure\\nhave been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first\\nshe then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you\\nhad shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me\\nhow it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity\\nto thank youi could not thank you too muchfor every wish and\\nevery endeavour to do her good  she was sensible that you had never\\nreceived any proper acknowledgment from herself\\n\\nif i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously\\nwhich in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous\\nconscience she must be i could not bear these thanksfor oh\\nmrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil\\nand the good i have done miss fairfaxwell checking herself\\nand trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten\\nyou are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars\\nthey shew her to the greatest advantage  i am sure she is very good\\ni hope she will be very happy  it is fit that the fortune\\nshould be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers\\n\\nsuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs weston\\nshe thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more\\nshe loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest\\nshe talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection\\nbut she had too much to urge for emmas attention it was soon gone\\nto brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen\\nand when mrs weston ended with we have not yet had the letter\\nwe are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come\\nshe was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged\\nto answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it\\nwas which they were so anxious for\\n\\nare you well my emma was mrs westons parting question\\n\\noh perfectly  i am always well you know  be sure to give me\\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible\\n\\nmrs westons communications furnished emma with more food for\\nunpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion\\nand her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax  she bitterly\\nregretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed\\nfor the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure\\nthe cause  had she followed mr knightleys known wishes in paying\\nthat attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she\\ntried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy\\nhad she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith\\nshe must in all probability have been spared from every pain\\nwhich pressed on her nowbirth abilities and education\\nhad been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received\\nwith gratitude and the otherwhat was shesupposing even that\\nthey had never become intimate friends that she had never been\\nadmitted into miss fairfaxs confidence on this important matter\\nwhich was most probablestill in knowing her as she ought\\nand as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable\\nsuspicions of an improper attachment to mr dixon which she had\\nnot only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so\\nunpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made\\na subject of material distress to the delicacy of janes feelings\\nby the levity or carelessness of frank churchills  of all the sources\\nof evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury\\nshe was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst\\nshe must have been a perpetual enemy  they never could have been\\nall three together without her having stabbed jane fairfaxs peace\\nin a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been\\nthe agony of a mind that would bear no more\\n\\nthe evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield\\nthe weather added what it could of gloom  a cold stormy rain set in\\nand nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the\\nwind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made\\nsuch cruel sights the longer visible\\n\\nthe weather affected mr woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably\\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughters side\\nand by exertions which had never cost her half so much before\\nit reminded her of their first forlorn teteatete on the evening\\nof mrs westons weddingday but mr knightley had walked\\nin then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy\\nalas such delightful proofs of hartfields attraction as those\\nsort of visits conveyed might shortly be over  the picture which\\nshe had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter\\nhad proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures\\nhad been lostbut her present forebodings she feared would\\nexperience no similar contradiction  the prospect before her now\\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled\\nthat might not be even partially brightened  if all took place\\nthat might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must\\nbe comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the\\nspirits only of ruined happiness\\n\\nthe child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer\\nthan herself and mrs westons heart and time would be occupied\\nby it  they should lose her and probably in great measure\\nher husband alsofrank churchill would return among them no more\\nand miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease\\nto belong to highbury  they would be married and settled either\\nat or near enscombe  all that were good would be withdrawn and if\\nto these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would\\nremain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach\\nmr knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort\\nno longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change\\nhis own home for theirshow was it to be endured  and if he were\\nto be lost to them for harriets sake if he were to be thought\\nof hereafter as finding in harriets society all that he wanted\\nif harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend\\nthe wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence\\nwhat could be increasing emmas wretchedness but the reflection never far\\ndistant from her mind that it had been all her own work\\n\\nwhen it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain\\nfrom a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room\\nfor a few secondsand the only source whence any thing like consolation\\nor composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own\\nbetter conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and\\ngaiety might be the

meant to walk with her\\nshe found  he had just looked into the diningroom and as he\\nwas not wanted there preferred being out of doorsshe thought\\nhe neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible\\ncause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been\\ncommunicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner\\nin which they had been received\\n\\nthey walked together  he was silent  she thought he was often\\nlooking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it\\nsuited her to give  and this belief produced another dread\\nperhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet\\nhe might be watching for encouragement to beginshe did not\\ncould not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject\\nhe must do it all himself

consideration replied\\n\\nyou are very kindbut you are mistakenand i must set you right\\ni am not in want of that sort of compassion  my blindness to what\\nwas going on led me to act by them in a

saying\\nrelative to harriet had been all taken as the language of her\\nown feelings and that her agitation her doubts her reluctance\\nher discouragement had been all received as discouragement\\nfrom herselfand not only was there time for these convictions\\nwith all their glow of attendant happiness there was time also to\\nrejoice that harriets secret had not escaped her and to resolve\\nthat it need not and should notit was all the service she could\\nnow render her poor friend for as to any of that heroism of sentiment\\nwhich might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection\\nfrom herself to harriet as infinitely the most worthy of the two\\nor even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him\\nat once and for ever without vouchsafing

enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house\\nor even the attentive daughter\\n\\npoor mr woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him\\nin the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so\\nanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ridecould he\\nhave seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs\\nbut without the most distant imagination of the impending evil\\nwithout the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in\\nthe looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably\\nall the articles of news he had received from mr perry and talked\\non with much selfcontentment totally unsuspicious of what they\\ncould have told him in return\\n\\nas long as mr knightley remained with them emmas fever continued\\nbut when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised\\nand subduedand in the course of the sleepless night which was\\nthe tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious\\npoints to consider as made her feel that even her happiness\\nmust have some alloy  her fatherand harriet  she could not be\\nalone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims\\nand how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question\\nwith respect to her father it was a question soon answered\\nshe hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short\\nparley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution\\nof never quitting her fathershe even wept over the idea of it\\nas a sin of thought  while he lived it must be only an engagement\\nbut she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of\\ndrawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him\\nhow to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision\\nhow to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make\\nher any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy\\non these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great\\nand her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter\\nreproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it\\nshe could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a\\nmeeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter\\nthat it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just\\nnow for a time from highbury andindulging in one scheme more\\nnearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation\\nfor her to brunswick squareisabella had been pleased with harriet\\nand a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement\\nshe did not think it in

thing was due a separation for the present an averting\\nof the evil day when they must all be together again\\n\\nshe rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment\\nwhich left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr knightley\\nin walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon\\nand half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again\\nwith him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate\\nher in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before\\n\\nhe had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have\\nthe slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter\\nwas brought her from randallsa very thick lettershe guessed\\nwhat it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it\\nshe

a brick house sashed windows below\\nand casements above in highbury  i dared not address her openly\\nmy difficulties in the then state of enscombe must be too well\\nknown to require definition and

till miss fairfax\\nwas in highbury and as you were the person slighted you will\\nforgive me instantly but i must work on my fathers compassion\\nby reminding him that so long as i absented myself from his house\\nso long i lost the blessing of knowing you  my behaviour\\nduring the very happy fortnight which i spent with you did not\\ni hope lay me open to reprehension excepting on one point\\nand now i come to the principal the only important part of my\\nconduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety\\nor requires very solicitous explanation  with the greatest respect\\nand the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father\\nperhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation\\na few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion\\nand some censure i acknowledge myself liable tomy behaviour\\nto miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought\\nin order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led\\non to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy\\ninto which we were immediately throwni cannot deny that miss\\nwoodhouse was my ostensible objectbut i am sure you will believe\\nthe declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference\\ni would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on\\namiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me\\nthe idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was\\nperfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much\\nmy conviction as my wishshe received my attentions with an easy\\nfriendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me\\nwe seemed to understand each other  from our relative situation\\nthose attentions were her due and were felt to be sowhether miss\\nwoodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of\\nthat fortnight i cannot saywhen i called to take leave of her\\ni remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth\\nand i then fancied she was not without suspicion but i have no\\ndoubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree\\nshe may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must\\nhave penetrated a part  i cannot doubt it  you will find\\nwhenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints\\nthat it did not take her wholly by surprize  she frequently gave\\nme hints of it  i remember her telling me at the ball that i\\nowed mrs elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax\\ni hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted\\nby you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss\\nwhile you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse\\ni could deserve nothing from either  acquit me here and procure\\nfor me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that\\nsaid emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection\\nas to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself\\nwhatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have\\nnow a key to  my heart was in highbury and my business was to get\\nmy body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion\\nif you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account\\nof the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say\\nthat its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would\\nnever have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her\\nthe delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement\\nmy dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to\\nyou will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself\\nno description can describe her  she must tell you herself what she is\\nyet not by word for never was there a human creature who would\\nso designedly suppress her own meritsince i began this letter\\nwhich will be longer than i foresaw i have heard from her\\nshe gives a good account of her own health but as she never complains\\ni dare not depend  i want to have your opinion of her looks\\ni know you will soon call on her she is living in dread of the visit\\nperhaps it is paid already  let me hear from you without delay\\ni am impatient for a thousand particulars  remember how few\\nminutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state\\nand i am not much better yet still insane either from happiness\\nor misery  when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with\\nof her excellence and patience and my uncles generosity i am mad\\nwith joy  but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her\\nand how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger\\nif i could but see her againbut i must not propose it yet\\nmy uncle has been too good for me to encroachi must still add\\nto this long letter  you have not heard all that you ought to hear\\ni could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness\\nand in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out\\nneeds explanation for though the event of the 26th ult as you\\nwill conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects\\ni should not have presumed on such early measures but from the\\nvery particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose\\ni should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have\\nfelt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement\\nbut i had no choice  the hasty engagement she had entered into with\\nthat womanhere my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly\\nto recollect and compose myselfi have been walking over the country\\nand am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter\\nwhat it ought to beit is in fact a most mortifying retrospect\\nfor me  i behaved shamefully  and here i can admit that my manners\\nto miss w in being unpleasant to miss f were highly blameable\\nshe disapproved them which ought to have been enoughmy plea of\\nconcealing the truth she did not think sufficientshe was displeased\\ni thought unreasonably so  i thought her on a thousand occasions\\nunnecessarily scrupulous and cautious  i thought her even cold\\nbut she was always right  if i had followed her judgment and subdued\\nmy spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have\\nescaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever knownwe quarrelled\\ndo you remember the morning spent at donwellthere every little\\ndissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis  i was late\\ni met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her\\nbut she would not suffer it  she absolutely refused to allow me\\nwhich i then thought most unreasonable  now however i see nothing\\nin it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion\\nwhile i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one\\nhour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she\\nto be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\\nevery previous caution uselesshad we been met walking together\\nbetween donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspected\\ni was mad enough however to resenti doubted her affection\\ni doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by\\nsuch conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her\\nand such apparent devotion to miss w as it would have been\\nimpossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her\\nresentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me\\nin short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side\\nabominable on mine and i returned the same evening to richmond\\nthough i might have staid with you till the next morning\\nmerely because i would be as angry with her as possible  even then\\ni was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time\\nbut i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went\\naway determined that she should make the first advancesi shall\\nalways congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party\\nhad you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would\\never have thought well of me again  its effect upon her appears\\nin the immediate resolution it produced  as soon as she found i\\nwas really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that\\nofficious mrs elton the whole system of whose treatment of her\\nby the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred\\ni must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been\\nso richly extended towards myself but otherwise i should loudly\\nprotest against the share of it which that woman has known\\njane indeedyou will observe that i have not yet indulged myself\\nin calling her by that name even to you  think then what i must\\nhave endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all\\nthe vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of\\nimaginary superiority  have patience with me i shall soon have done\\nshe closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely\\nand wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again\\nshe felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery\\nto each  she dissolved itthis letter reached me on the very\\nmorning of my poor aunts death  i answered it within an hour\\nbut from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business\\nfalling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all\\nthe many other letters of that day was locked up in my writingdesk\\nand i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines\\nto satisfy her remained without any uneasinessi was rather\\ndisappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily\\nbut i made excuses for her and was too busy andmay i add\\ntoo cheerful in my views to be captiouswe removed to windsor\\nand two days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters\\nall returnedand a few lines at the same time by the post\\nstating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply\\nto her last and adding that as silence on such a point could\\nnot be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both\\nto have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible\\nshe now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested\\nthat if i could not directly command hers so as to send them\\nto highbury within a week i would forward them after that period\\nto her at  in

irresistible every line relating\\nto herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable\\nand when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself\\nby the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the\\nvery strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at\\nthat moment  she never stopt till she had gone through the whole\\nand though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong\\nyet he had been less wrong than she had supposedand he had suffered\\nand was very sorryand he was so grateful to mrs weston\\nand so much in love with miss

letter that when mr knightley came again\\nshe desired him to read it  she was sure of mrs westons wishing\\nit to be communicated especially to one who like mr knightley\\nhad seen so much to blame in his conduct\\n\\ni shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long\\ni will take it home with me at night\\n\\nbut that would not do  mr weston was to call in the evening\\nand she must return it by him\\n\\ni would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems\\na matter of justice it shall be done\\n\\nhe beganstopping however almost directly to say had i been offered\\nthe sight of one of this gentlemans letters to his motherinlaw a few\\nmonths ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference\\n\\nhe proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then\\nwith a smile observed humph a fine complimentary opening\\nbut it is his way  one mans style must not be the rule of anothers\\nwe will not be severe\\n\\nit will be natural for me

with his letter as i am\\nbut still you must at least i hope you must think the better\\nof him for it  i hope it does him some service with you\\n\\nyes certainly it does  he has had great faults faults of\\ninconsideration and thoughtlessness and i am very much of his\\nopinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves\\nbut still as he is beyond a doubt really attached to miss fairfax\\nand will soon it may be hoped have the advantage of being constantly\\nwith her i am very ready to believe his character will improve\\nand acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle\\nthat it wants  and now let me talk to you of something else\\ni have another persons interest at present so much at heart\\nthat i cannot think any longer about frank churchill  ever since i\\nleft you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on\\none subject\\n\\nthe subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english\\nsuch as mr knightley used even to the woman he was in love with\\nhow to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the\\nhappiness of her father  emmas answer was ready at the first word\\nwhile her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible\\nfor her  she could never quit him  part only of this answer\\nhowever was admitted  the impossibility of her quitting her father\\nmr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility\\nof any other change he could not agree to  he had been thinking\\nit over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce\\nmr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe\\nit feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer\\nhim to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion\\nthat such a transplantation would be a risk of her fathers comfort\\nperhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded  mr woodhouse\\ntaken from hartfieldno he felt that it ought not to be attempted\\nbut the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted\\nhis dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable\\nit was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as\\nher fathers happiness in other words his liferequired hartfield\\nto continue her home it should be his likewise\\n\\nof their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own\\npassing thoughts  like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it\\nbut such an alternative as this had not occurred to her\\nshe was sensible of all the affection it evinced  she felt that\\nin quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence\\nof hours and habits that in living constantly with her father\\nand in no house of his own there would be much very much\\nto be borne with  she promised to think of it and advised him\\nto think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection\\ncould alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject  he had\\ngiven it he could assure her very long and calm consideration\\nhe had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning\\nto have his thoughts to himself\\n\\nah there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma  i am\\nsure william larkins will not like it  you must get his consent\\nbefore you ask mine\\n\\nshe promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover\\nto think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme\\n\\nit is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view\\nin which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never\\nstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights\\nas heirexpectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded\\nthink she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy\\nand yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it\\nand found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent\\ndislike of mr knightleys marrying jane fairfax or any body else\\nwhich at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of\\nthe sister and the aunt\\n\\nthis proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield\\nthe more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became\\nhis evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase\\ntheir mutual good to outweigh every drawback  such a companion\\nfor herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her\\nsuch a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be\\ngiving increase of melancholy\\n\\nshe would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every\\nblessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings\\nof her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield\\nthe delightful family party which emma was securing for herself\\npoor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a\\ndistance from  she would be a loser in every way  emma could not\\ndeplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment\\nin such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise\\nbut for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity\\nthat was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment\\n\\nin time of course mr knightley would be forgotten that is\\nsupplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early\\nmr knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure\\nnot like mr elton  mr knightley always so kind so feeling\\nso truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be\\nless worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even\\nof harriet that she could be in love with more than three men\\nin one year\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvi\\n\\n\\nit was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous\\nas herself to avoid a meeting  their intercourse was painful\\nenough by letter  how much worse had they been obliged to meet\\n\\nharriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed\\nwithout reproaches or apparent sense of illusage and yet emma fancied\\nthere was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in\\nher style which increased the desirableness of their being separate\\nit might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an\\nangel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke\\n\\nshe had no difficulty in procuring isabellas invitation\\nand she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it\\nwithout resorting to inventionthere was a tooth amiss\\nharriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist\\nmrs john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill\\nhealth was a recommendation to herand though not so fond of a\\ndentist as of a mr wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet\\nunder her carewhen it was thus settled on her sisters side\\nemma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable\\nharriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was\\nto be conveyed in mr woodhouses carriageit was all arranged\\nit was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square\\n\\nnow emma could indeed enjoy mr knightleys visits now she\\ncould talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by\\nthat sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful\\nwhich had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was\\nnear her how much might at that moment and at a little distance\\nbe enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself\\n\\nthe difference of harriet at mrs goddards or in london made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in emmas sensations but she could not\\nthink of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment\\nwhich must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself\\n\\nshe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\nin her mind which harriet had occupied  there was a communication\\nbefore her one which she only could be competent to make\\nthe confession of her engagement to her father but she would\\nhave nothing to do with it at presentshe had resolved to defer\\nthe disclosure till mrs weston were safe and well  no additional\\nagitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved\\nand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the\\nappointed timea fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind\\nto crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers\\n\\nshe soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half\\nan hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax\\nshe ought to goand she was longing to see her the resemblance of\\ntheir present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill\\nit would be a secret satisfaction but the consciousness of a\\nsimilarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with\\nwhich she should attend to any thing jane might communicate\\n\\nshe wentshe had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had\\nnot been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor\\njane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion\\nthough all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected\\nthe fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured\\nof their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name\\nshe heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor\\nmiss bates had before made so happily intelligibleno she heard\\nnothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk upand a moment\\nafterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly\\nforward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient\\nemma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging\\nthere was consciousness animation and warmth there was every\\nthing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted\\nshe came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very\\nfeeling tone\\n\\nthis is most kind indeedmiss woodhouse it is impossible\\nfor me to expressi hope you will believeexcuse me for being\\nso entirely without words\\n\\nemma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words\\nif the sound of mrs eltons voice from the sittingroom had not\\nchecked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly\\nand all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest\\nshake of the hand\\n\\nmrs bates and mrs elton were together  miss bates was out\\nwhich accounted for the previous tranquillity  emma could have\\nwished mrs elton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience\\nwith every body and as mrs elton met her with unusual graciousness\\nshe hoped the rencontre would do them no harm\\n\\nshe soon believed herself to penetrate mrs eltons thoughts\\nand understand why she was like herself in happy spirits\\nit was being in miss fairfaxs confidence and fancying herself\\nacquainted with what was still a secret to other people\\nemma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face\\nand while paying her own compliments to mrs bates and appearing\\nto attend to the good old ladys replies she saw her with a sort\\nof anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently\\nbeen reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple\\nand gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods\\n\\nwe can finish this some other time you know  you and i shall\\nnot want

in a half whisper\\n\\ni mentioned no names you will observeoh no cautious as\\na minister of state  i managed it extremely well\\n\\nemma could not doubt  it was a palpable display repeated on every\\npossible occasion  when they had all talked a little while in harmony\\nof the weather and mrs weston she found herself abruptly addressed with\\n\\ndo not you think miss woodhouse our saucy

weather lasts\\nit must be the same party you know quite the same party\\nnot one exception\\n\\nsoon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted\\nby the perplexity of her

for my lord and master\\nhe promised to join me here and pay his respects to you\\n\\nwhat are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton\\nthat will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do

crown a regular meeting\\nweston and cole will be there too but one is apt to speak only\\nof those who leadi fancy mr e and knightley have every thing\\ntheir own way\\n\\nhave not you mistaken the day said emma  i am almost certain\\nthat the meeting at the crown is not till tomorrowmr knightley\\nwas at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday\\n\\noh no the meeting is certainly today was the abrupt answer\\nwhich denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs eltons side\\ni do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish\\nthat ever was  we never heard of such things at maple grove\\n\\nyour parish there was small said jane\\n\\nupon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject\\ntalked of\\n\\nbut it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard\\nyou speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge\\nthe only school and not more than fiveandtwenty children\\n\\nah you clever creature thats very true  what a thinking brain\\nyou have  i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make\\nif we could be shaken together  my liveliness and your solidity\\nwould produce perfectionnot that i presume to insinuate however\\nthat some people may not think you perfection alreadybut hush\\nnot a word if you please\\n\\nit seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words\\nnot to mrs elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw\\nthe wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted\\nwas very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look\\n\\nmr elton made his appearance  his lady greeted him with some\\nof her sparkling vivacity\\n\\nvery pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an\\nencumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come\\nbut you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with\\nyou knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared\\nhere have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies\\na sample of true conjugal obediencefor who can say you know\\nhow soon it may be wanted\\n\\nmr elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away\\nhis civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent\\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering\\nand the walk he had had for nothing\\n\\nwhen i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found\\nvery odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning\\nand the message he returned that he should certainly be at home\\ntill one\\n\\ndonwell cried his wifemy dear mr e you have not been\\nto donwellyou mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown\\n\\nno no thats tomorrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley\\ntoday on that very accountsuch a dreadful broiling morning\\ni went over the fields toospeaking in a tone of great illusage\\nwhich made it so much the worse  and then not to find him at home\\ni assure you i am not at all pleased  and no apology left no message\\nfor me  the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected\\nvery extraordinaryand nobody knew at all which way he was gone\\nperhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods\\nmiss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightleycan you\\nexplain it\\n\\nemma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary\\nindeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him\\n\\ni cannot imagine said mrs elton feeling the indignity as a wife\\nought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you\\nof all people in the world  the very last person whom one should expect\\nto be forgottenmy dear mr e he must have left a message for you\\ni am sure he mustnot even knightley could be so very eccentric\\nand his servants forgot it  depend upon it that was the case\\nand very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all\\ni have often observed extremely awkward and remissi am sure i\\nwould not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard\\nfor any consideration  and as for mrs hodges wright holds\\nher very cheap indeedshe promised wright a receipt and never\\nsent it\\n\\ni met william larkins continued mr elton as i got near\\nthe house and he told me i should not find his master at home\\nbut i did not believe himwilliam seemed rather out of humour\\nhe did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he\\ncould hardly ever get the speech of him  i have nothing to do with\\nwilliams wants but it really is of very great importance that i\\nshould see knightley today and it becomes a matter therefore\\nof very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk\\nto no purpose\\n\\nemma felt that she could not do better than go home directly\\nin all probability she was at this very time waited for there\\nand mr knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression\\ntowards mr elton if not towards william larkins\\n\\nshe was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined\\nto attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs\\nit gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of\\nto say\\n\\nit is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility\\nhad you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been\\ntempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more\\nopenly than might have been strictly correcti feel that i should\\ncertainly have been impertinent\\n\\noh cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought\\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her\\nusual composurethere would have been no danger  the danger\\nwould have been of my wearying you  you could not have gratified\\nme more than by expressing an interest  indeed miss woodhouse\\nspeaking more collectedly with the consciousness which i\\nhave of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly\\nconsoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good\\nopinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a\\ndegree as toi have not time for half that i could wish to say\\ni long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself\\ni feel it so very due  but unfortunatelyin short if your\\ncompassion does not stand my friend\\n\\noh you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly\\nand taking her hand  you owe me no apologies and every body to\\nwhom you might be supposed to owe them is so perfectly satisfied\\nso delighted even\\n\\nyou are very kind but i know what my manners were to you\\nso cold and artificiali had always a part to actit was a life\\nof deceiti know that i must have disgusted you\\n\\npray say no more  i feel that all the apologies should be on my side\\nlet us forgive each other at once  we must do whatever is to be\\ndone quickest and i think our feelings will lose no time there\\ni hope you have pleasant accounts from windsor\\n\\nvery\\n\\nand the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you\\njust as i begin to know you\\n\\noh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet\\ni am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell\\n\\nnothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma\\nsmilingbut excuse me it must be thought of\\n\\nthe smile was returned as jane answered\\n\\nyou are very right it has been thought of  and i will own\\nto you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living\\nwith mr churchill at enscombe it is settled  there must be\\nthree months at least of deep mourning but when they are over\\ni imagine there will be nothing more to wait for\\n\\nthank you thank youthis is just what i wanted to be assured of\\noh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open\\ngoodbye goodbye\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvii\\n\\n\\nmrs westons friends were all made happy by her safety\\nand if the satisfaction of her welldoing could be increased\\nto emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl\\nshe had been decided in wishing for a miss weston  she would\\nnot acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match\\nfor her hereafter with either of isabellas sons but she was\\nconvinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best\\nit would be a great comfort to mr weston as he grew older\\nand even mr weston might be growing older ten years henceto have\\nhis fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense the freaks\\nand the fancies of a child never banished from home and mrs weston\\nno one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her and it\\nwould be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach\\nshould not have their powers in exercise again\\n\\nshe has had the advantage you know of practising on me\\nshe

to counteract the indulgence of other people\\ni doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it\\n\\ndo youi have no doubt  nature gave you understanding\\nmiss taylor gave you principles  you must have done well\\nmy interference was quite as likely to do harm as good  it was\\nvery natural for you to say what right has he to lecture me\\nand i am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done\\nin a disagreeable manner  i do not believe i did you any good\\nthe good was all to myself by making you an object of the tenderest\\naffection to me  i could not think about you so much without doating\\non you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors\\nhave been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least\\n\\ni am sure you were of use to me cried emma  i was very often\\ninfluenced rightly by youoftener than i would own at the time\\ni am very sure you did me good  and if poor little anna weston is\\nto be spoiled it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much\\nfor her as you have done for me except falling in love with her\\nwhen she is thirteen\\n\\nhow often when you were a girl have you said to me with one\\nof your saucy looksmr knightley i am going to do soandso\\npapa says i may or i have miss taylors leavesomething which\\nyou knew i did not approve  in such cases my interference was giving\\nyou two bad feelings instead of one\\n\\nwhat an amiable creature i wasno wonder you should hold\\nmy speeches in such affectionate remembrance\\n\\nmr knightleyyou always called me mr knightley and\\nfrom habit it has not so very formal a soundand yet it is formal\\ni want you to call me something else but i do not know what\\n\\ni remember once calling you george in one of my amiable fits\\nabout ten years ago  i did it because i thought it would offend you\\nbut as you made no objection i never did it again\\n\\nand cannot you call me george now\\n\\nimpossiblei never can call you any thing but mr knightley\\ni will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of mrs elton\\nby calling you mr kbut i will promise she added presently\\nlaughing and blushingi will promise to call you once by your\\nchristian name  i do not say when but perhaps you may guess\\nwherein the building in which n takes m for better for worse\\n\\nemma grieved that she could not be more openly just to

smith\\nbut it was too tender a subjectshe could not enter on it\\nharriet was very seldom mentioned between them  this on his side\\nmight merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma\\nwas rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion\\nfrom some appearances that their friendship were declining\\nshe was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances\\nthey certainly should have corresponded more and that her\\nintelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did\\non isabellas letters  he might observe that it was so  the pain\\nof being obliged to practise concealment towards him was very little\\ninferior to the pain of having made harriet unhappy\\n\\nisabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could\\nbe expected on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits\\nwhich appeared perfectly natural as there was a dentist to\\nbe consulted but since that business had been over she did not\\nappear to find harriet different from what she had known her before\\nisabella to be sure was no very quick observer yet if harriet\\nhad not been equal to playing with the children it would not have\\nescaped her  emmas comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on\\nby harriets being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be\\na month at least  mr and mrs john knightley were to come down\\nin august and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back\\n\\njohn does not even mention your friend said mr knightley\\nhere is his answer if you like to see it\\n\\nit was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage\\nemma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive\\nto know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing\\nthat her friend was unmentioned\\n\\njohn enters like a brother into my happiness continued mr knightley\\nbut he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have\\nlikewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from\\nmaking flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather\\ncool in her praise  but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes\\n\\nhe writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read\\nthe letter  i honour his sincerity  it is very plain that he\\nconsiders the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side\\nbut that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy\\nof your affection as you think me already  had he said any thing\\nto bear a different construction i should not have believed him\\n\\nmy emma he means no such thing  he only means\\n\\nhe and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two\\ninterrupted she with a sort of serious smilemuch less perhaps\\nthan he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve\\non the subject\\n\\nemma my dear emma\\n\\noh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your\\nbrother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in\\nthe secret and hear his opinion  depend upon it he will be much\\nfarther from doing you justice  he will think all the happiness\\nall the advantage on your side of the question all the merit\\non mine  i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once\\nhis tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther\\n\\nah he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced\\nas john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give\\nto be happy together  i am amused by one part of johns letter\\ndid you notice itwhere he says that my information did not take\\nhim wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing\\nsomething of the kind\\n\\nif i understand your brother he only means so far as your having\\nsome thoughts of marrying  he had no idea of me  he seems perfectly\\nunprepared for that\\n\\nyes yesbut i am amused that he should have seen so far into\\nmy feelings  what has he been judging byi am not conscious\\nof any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare\\nhim at this time for my marrying any more than at another\\nbut it was so i suppose  i dare say there was a difference when i\\nwas staying with them the other day  i believe i did not play\\nwith the children quite so much as usual  i remember one evening\\nthe poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now\\n\\nthe time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons\\nreception of it tried  as soon as mrs weston was sufficiently\\nrecovered to admit mr woodhouses visits emma having it in view\\nthat her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause\\nresolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls\\nbut how to break it to her father at lastshe had bound herself\\nto do it in such an hour of mr knightleys absence or when it\\ncame to the point her heart would have failed her and she must\\nhave put it off but mr knightley was to come at such a time\\nand follow up the beginning she was to makeshe was forced\\nto speak and to speak cheerfully too  she must not make it a more\\ndecided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself\\nshe must not appear to think it a misfortunewith all the spirits\\nshe could command she prepared him first for something strange\\nand then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation\\ncould be obtainedwhich she trusted would be attended with\\nno difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all\\nshe and mr knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield\\nwould receive the constant addition of that persons company\\nwhom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs weston\\nbest in the world\\n\\npoor manit was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried\\nearnestly to dissuade her from it  she was reminded more than once\\nof having always said she would never marry and assured that it\\nwould be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of\\npoor isabella and poor miss taylorbut it would not do  emma hung\\nabout him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that\\nhe must not class her with isabella and mrs weston whose marriages\\ntaking them from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change\\nbut she was not going from hartfield she should be always there\\nshe was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but\\nfor the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal\\nthe happier for having mr knightley always at hand when he were once\\ngot used to the ideadid he not love mr knightley very much\\nhe would not deny that he did she was surewhom did he ever want\\nto consult on business but mr knightleywho was so useful to him\\nwho so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him\\nwho so cheerful so attentive so attached to himwould not he\\nlike to have him always on the spotyes  that was all very true\\nmr knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see\\nhim every daybut they did see him every day as it waswhy could\\nnot they go on as they had done\\n\\nmr woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome\\nthe idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest\\nto emmas entreaties and assurances succeeded mr knightleys\\nwhose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome\\nand he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion\\nthey had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters\\nof the strongest approbation and mrs weston was ready\\non the first meeting to consider the subject in the most\\nserviceable lightfirst as a settled and secondly as a good one\\nwell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations\\nto mr woodhouses mindit was agreed upon as what was to be\\nand every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that\\nit would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself\\nwhich almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other\\nin another year or two perhapsit might not be so very bad\\nif the marriage did take place\\n\\nmrs weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she\\nsaid to him in favour of the eventshe had been extremely surprized\\nnever more so than when emma first opened the affair to her\\nbut she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had\\nno scruple in urging him to the utmostshe had such a regard\\nfor mr knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma\\nand it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable\\na connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance\\nso peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed\\nas if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature\\nand that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having\\nthought of it and wished it long agohow very few of those men\\nin a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own\\nhome for hartfield  and who but mr knightley could know and bear\\nwith mr woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable\\nthe difficulty of disposing of poor mr woodhouse had been always\\nfelt in her husbands plans and her own for a marriage between frank\\nand emma  how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had\\nbeen a continual impedimentless acknowledged by mr weston than\\nby herselfbut even he had never been able to finish the subject\\nbetter than by sayingthose matters will take care of themselves\\nthe young people will find a way  but here there was nothing to be\\nshifted off in a wild speculation on the future  it was all right\\nall open all equal  no sacrifice on any side worth the name\\nit was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself\\nand without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it\\n\\nmrs weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections\\nas these was one of the happiest women in the world  if any thing\\ncould increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would\\nsoon have outgrown its first set of caps\\n\\nthe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread\\nand mr weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes\\nwere enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind\\nhe saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all\\nthe constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing\\nand by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he\\nhad always foreseen it\\n\\nit is to be a secret i conclude said he  these matters are\\nalways a secret till it is found out that every body knows them\\nonly let me be told when i may speak outi wonder whether jane has\\nany suspicion\\n\\nhe went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on\\nthat point  he told her the news  was not she like a daughter\\nhis eldest daughterhe must tell her and miss bates being present\\nit passed of course to mrs cole mrs perry and mrs elton\\nimmediately afterwards  it was no more than the principals were\\nprepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known\\nat randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking\\nof themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle\\nwith great sagacity\\n\\nin general it was a very well approved match  some might think him\\nand others might think her the most in luck  one set might\\nrecommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield\\nfor the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements\\namong their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious\\nobjection raised except in one habitation the vicaragethere\\nthe surprize was not softened by any satisfaction  mr elton\\ncared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the\\nyoung ladys pride would now be contented and supposed she had\\nalways meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point\\nof living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than i\\nbut mrs elton was very much discomposed indeedpoor knightley\\npoor fellowsad business for himshe was extremely concerned\\nfor though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities\\nhow could he be so taken indid not think him at all in love\\nnot in the leastpoor knightleythere would be an end of all\\npleasant intercourse with himhow happy he had been to come and dine\\nwith them whenever they asked him  but that would be all over now\\npoor fellowno more exploring parties to donwell made for her\\noh no there would be a mrs knightley to throw cold water on\\nevery

who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end\\nof the first quarter\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xviii\\n\\n\\ntime passed on  a few more tomorrows and the party from london\\nwould be arriving  it was an alarming change and emma was thinking\\nof it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and\\ngrieve her when mr knightley came in and distressing thoughts\\nwere put by  after the first chat of pleasure he was silent\\nand then in a graver tone began with\\n\\ni have something to tell you emma some news\\n\\ngood or bad said she quickly looking up in his face\\n\\ni do not know which it ought to be called\\n\\noh good i am surei see it in your countenance  you are trying\\nnot to smile\\n\\ni am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid\\nmy dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it\\n\\nindeed but why soi can hardly imagine that any thing which\\npleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too\\n\\nthere is one subject he replied i hope but one on which\\nwe do not think alike  he paused a moment again smiling\\nwith his eyes fixed on her face  does nothing occur to you\\ndo not you recollectharriet smith\\n\\nher cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something\\nthough she knew not what\\n\\nhave you heard from her yourself this morning cried he\\nyou have i believe and know the whole\\n\\nno i have not i know nothing pray tell me\\n\\nyou are prepared for the worst i seeand very bad it is\\nharriet smith marries robert martin\\n\\nemma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared\\nand her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible\\nbut her lips were closed\\n\\nit is so indeed continued mr knightley i have it from robert\\nmartin himself  he left me not half an hour ago\\n\\nshe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement\\n\\nyou like it my emma as little as i fearedi wish our opinions were\\nthe same  but in time they will  time you may be sure will make\\none or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile\\nwe need not talk much on the subject\\n\\nyou mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself\\nit is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy\\nbut i cannot believe it  it seems an impossibilityyou cannot mean\\nto say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin  you cannot\\nmean that he has even proposed to her againyet  you only mean\\nthat he intends it\\n\\ni mean that he has done it answered mr knightley with smiling\\nbut determined decision and been accepted\\n\\ngood god she criedwellthen having recourse to her workbasket\\nin excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the\\nexquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she\\nmust be expressing she added well now tell me every thing\\nmake this intelligible to me  how where whenlet me know it all\\ni never was more surprizedbut it does not make me unhappy\\ni assure youhowhow has it been possible\\n\\nit is a very simple story  he went to town on business three days ago\\nand i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting\\nto send to johnhe delivered these papers to john at his chambers\\nand was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astleys\\nthey were going to take the two eldest boys to astleys the party\\nwas to be our brother and sister henry johnand miss smith\\nmy friend robert could not resist  they called for him in their way\\nwere all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with\\nthem the next daywhich he didand in the course of that visit\\nas i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet\\nand certainly did not speak in vainshe made him by her acceptance\\nas happy even as he is deserving  he came down by yesterdays coach\\nand was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report\\nhis proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own\\nthis is all that i can relate of the how where and when\\nyour friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her\\nshe will give you all the minute particulars which only womans\\nlanguage can make interestingin our communications we deal only\\nin the greathowever i must say that robert martins heart seemed\\nfor him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention\\nwithout its being much to the purpose that on quitting their\\nbox at astleys my brother took charge of mrs john knightley\\nand little john and he followed with miss smith and henry\\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith\\nrather uneasy\\n\\nhe stoppedemma dared not attempt any immediate reply  to speak\\nshe was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree\\nof happiness  she must wait a moment or he would think her mad\\nher silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while\\nhe added\\n\\nemma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make\\nyou unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected\\nhis situation is an evilbut you must consider it as what satisfies\\nyour friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better\\nof him as you know him more  his good sense and good principles would\\ndelight youas far as the man is concerned you could not wish your\\nfriend in better hands  his rank in society i would alter if i could\\nwhich is saying a great deal i assure you emmayou laugh at me\\nabout william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin\\n\\nhe wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself\\nnot to smile too broadlyshe didcheerfully answering\\n\\nyou need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match  i think\\nharriet is doing extremely well  her connexions may be worse than his\\nin respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are\\ni have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize\\nyou cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly\\nunprepared i wasfor i had reason to believe her very lately more\\ndetermined against him much more than she was before\\n\\nyou ought to know your friend best replied mr knightley\\nbut i should say she was a goodtempered softhearted girl\\nnot likely to be very very determined against any young man who told\\nher he loved her\\n\\nemma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word\\ni believe you know her quite as well as i dobut mr knightley\\nare you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright\\naccepted him  i could suppose she might in timebut can she already\\ndid not you misunderstand himyou were both talking of other things\\nof business shows of cattle or new drillsand might not you\\nin the confusion of so many subjects mistake himit was not\\nharriets hand that he was certain ofit was the dimensions of some\\nfamous ox\\n\\nthe contrast between the countenance and air of mr knightley and\\nrobert martin was at this moment so strong to emmas feelings\\nand so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently\\npassed on harriets side so fresh the sound of those words\\nspoken with such emphasis no i hope i know better than to think\\nof robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence\\nto prove in some measure premature  it could not be otherwise\\n\\ndo you dare say this cried mr knightley  do you dare to suppose\\nme so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of\\nwhat do you deserve\\n\\noh  i always deserve the best treatment because i never put\\nup with any other and therefore you must give me a plain\\ndirect answer  are you quite sure that you understand the terms\\non which mr martin and harriet now are\\n\\ni am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he\\ntold me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity\\nnothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you\\na proof that it must be so  he asked my opinion as to what he\\nwas now to do  he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he\\ncould apply for information of her relations or friends  could i\\nmention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard\\ni assured him that i could not  then he said he would endeavour\\nto see her in the course of this day\\n\\ni am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles\\nand most sincerely wish them happy\\n\\nyou are materially changed since we talked on this subject before\\n\\ni hope sofor at that time i was a fool\\n\\nand i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all\\nharriets good qualities  i have taken some pains for your sake\\nand for robert martins sake whom i have always had reason to believe\\nas much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her\\ni have often talked to her a good deal  you must have seen that\\ni did  sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me\\nof pleading poor martins cause which was never the case but from all\\nmy observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl\\nwith very good notions very seriously good principles and placing\\nher happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life\\nmuch of this i have no doubt she may thank you for\\n\\nme cried emma shaking her headah poor harriet\\n\\nshe checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little\\nmore praise than she deserved\\n\\ntheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of\\nher father  she was not sorry  she wanted to be alone  her mind\\nwas in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her\\nto be collected  she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits\\nand till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed\\nand reflected she could be fit for nothing rational\\n\\nher fathers business was to announce jamess being gone out to put\\nthe horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls\\nand she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing\\n\\nthe joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations\\nmay be imagined  the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the\\nprospect of harriets welfare she was really in danger of becoming\\ntoo happy for securitywhat had she to wish for  nothing but to\\ngrow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been\\never so superior to her own  nothing but that the lessons\\nof her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future\\n\\nserious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions\\nand yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst\\nof them  she must laugh at such a close  such an end of the doleful\\ndisappointment of five weeks back  such a heartsuch a harriet\\n\\nnow there would be pleasure in her returningevery thing would\\nbe a pleasure  it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin\\n\\nhigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities\\nwas the reflection that all necessity of concealment from\\nmr knightley would soon be over  the disguise equivocation\\nmystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over\\nshe could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\\nconfidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty\\n\\nin the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father\\nnot always listening but always agreeing to what he said\\nand whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable\\npersuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day\\nor poor mrs weston would be disappointed\\n\\nthey arrivedmrs weston was alone in the drawingroom\\nbut hardly had they been told of the baby and mr woodhouse\\nreceived the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse\\nwas caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window\\n\\nit is frank and miss fairfax said mrs weston  i was just\\ngoing to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive\\nthis morning  he stays till tomorrow and miss fairfax has been\\npersuaded to spend the day with usthey are coming in i hope\\n\\nin half a minute they were in the room  emma was extremely glad\\nto see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of\\nembarrassing recollections on each side  they met readily and smiling\\nbut with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said\\nand having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank\\nin the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged\\nwhich she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more\\nand of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure\\nwhen mr weston joined the party however and when the baby\\nwas fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation\\nor of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her\\nand say\\n\\ni have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving\\nmessage in one of mrs westons letters  i hope time has not made\\nyou less willing to pardon  i hope you do not retract what you\\nthen said\\n\\nno indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least\\ni am particularly glad to see and shake hands with youand to give\\nyou joy in person\\n\\nhe thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak\\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness\\n\\nis not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane\\nbetter than she ever used to doyou see how my father and\\nmrs weston doat upon her\\n\\nbut his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes\\nafter mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named\\nthe name of dixonemma blushed and forbade its being pronounced\\nin her hearing\\n\\ni can never think of it she cried without extreme shame\\n\\nthe shame he answered is all mine or ought to be  but is it\\npossible that you had no suspicioni mean of late  early i know\\nyou had none\\n\\ni never had the smallest i assure you\\n\\nthat appears quite wonderful  i was once very nearand i wish i had\\nit would have been better  but though i was always doing wrong things\\nthey were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service\\nit would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond\\nof secrecy and told you every thing\\n\\nit is not now worth a regret said emma\\n\\ni have some hope resumed he of my uncles being persuaded\\nto pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her\\nwhen the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london\\nand continue there i trust till we may carry her northwardbut now\\ni am at such a distance from heris not it hard miss woodhouse\\ntill this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation\\ndo not you pity me\\n\\nemma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession\\nof gay thought he cried\\n\\nah by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for\\nthe momenti hope mr knightley is well  he pausedshe coloured\\nand laughedi know you saw my letter and think you may remember\\nmy wish in your favour  let me return your congratulations\\ni assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest\\nand satisfactionhe is a man whom i cannot presume to praise\\n\\nemma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style\\nbut his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his\\nown jane and his next words were\\n\\ndid you ever see such a skinsuch smoothness such delicacy\\nand yet without being actually fairone cannot call her fair\\nit is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eyelashes and hair\\na most distinguishing complexion  so peculiarly the lady in it\\njust colour enough for beauty\\n\\ni have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do not\\ni remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale\\nwhen we first began to talk of herhave you quite forgotten\\n\\noh nowhat an impudent dog i washow could i dare\\n\\nbut he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could\\nnot help saying\\n\\ni do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time\\nyou had very great amusement in tricking us alli am sure you had\\ni am sure it was a consolation to you\\n\\noh no no nohow can you suspect me of such a thing\\ni was the most miserable wretch\\n\\nnot quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth  i am sure it\\nwas a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking\\nus all inperhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell\\nyou the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself\\nin the same situation  i think there is a little likeness between us\\n\\nhe bowed\\n\\nif not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of\\ntrue sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny\\nwhich bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior\\nto our own\\n\\ntrue true he answered warmly  no not true on your side  you can\\nhave no superior but most true on mineshe is a complete angel\\nlook at her  is not she an angel in every gesture  observe the turn\\nof her throat  observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father\\nyou will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously\\nthat my uncle means to give her all my aunts jewels  they are to be\\nnew set  i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head\\nwill not it be beautiful in her dark hair\\n\\nvery beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly\\nthat he gratefully burst out\\n\\nhow delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such\\nexcellent looksi would not have missed this meeting for the world\\ni should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come\\n\\nthe others had been talking of the child mrs weston giving an\\naccount of a little alarm she had been under the evening before\\nfrom the infants appearing not quite well  she believed she had\\nbeen foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half\\na minute of sending for mr perry  perhaps she ought to be ashamed\\nbut mr weston had been almost as uneasy as herselfin ten minutes\\nhowever the child had been perfectly well again  this was\\nher history and particularly interesting it was to mr woodhouse\\nwho commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry\\nand only regretted that she had not done it  she should always send\\nfor perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered\\nwere it only for a moment  she could not be too soon alarmed\\nnor send for perry too often  it was a pity perhaps that he\\nhad not come last night for though the child seemed well now\\nvery well considering it would probably have been better if perry\\nhad seen it\\n\\nfrank churchill caught the name\\n\\nperry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss\\nfairfaxs eye  my friend mr perry  what are they saying\\nabout mr perryhas he been here this morningand how does\\nhe travel nowhas he set up his carriage\\n\\nemma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined\\nin the laugh it was evident from janes countenance that she\\ntoo was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf\\n\\nsuch an extraordinary dream of mine he cried  i can never think\\nof it without laughingshe hears us she hears us miss woodhouse\\ni see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown\\nlook at her  do not you see that at this instant the very passage\\nof her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye\\nthat the whole blunder is spread before herthat she can attend to\\nnothing else though pretending to listen to the others\\n\\njane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile\\npartly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious\\nlow yet steady voice\\n\\nhow you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me\\nthey will sometimes obtrudebut how you can court them\\n\\nhe had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly\\nbut emmas feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on\\nleaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men\\nshe felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill\\nand really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never\\nbeen more sensible of mr knightleys high superiority of character\\nthe happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the\\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xix\\n\\n\\nif emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet\\na momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured\\nof her attachment to mr knightley and really able to accept\\nanother man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she\\nhad to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty\\na very few days brought the party from london and she had no\\nsooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet\\nthan she became perfectly satisfiedunaccountable as it was\\nthat robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr knightley\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness\\n\\nharriet was a little distresseddid look a little foolish at first\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly\\nand selfdeceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die\\naway with the words and leave her without a care for the past\\nand with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to\\nher friends approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of\\nthat nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations\\nharriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at\\nastleys and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all\\nwith the utmost delight  but what did such particulars explain\\nthe fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had\\nalways liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had\\nbeen irresistiblebeyond this it must ever be unintelligible\\nto emma\\n\\nthe event however was most joyful and every day was giving her\\nfresh reason for thinking soharriets parentage became known\\nshe proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford\\nher the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent\\nenough to have always wished for concealmentsuch was the blood\\nof gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for\\nit was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many\\na gentleman  but what a connexion had she been preparing for\\nmr knightleyor for the churchillsor even for mr elton\\nthe stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth\\nwould have been a stain indeed\\n\\nno objection was raised on the fathers side the young man was\\ntreated liberally it was all as it should be  and as emma became\\nacquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield\\nshe fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth\\nwhich could bid fairest for her little friend  she had no doubt\\nof harriets happiness with any goodtempered man but with him\\nand in the home he offered there would be the hope of more\\nof security stability and improvement  she would be placed in the\\nmidst of those who loved her and who had better sense than herself\\nretired enough for safety and occupied enough for cheerfulness\\nshe would be never led into temptation nor left for it to find her out\\nshe would be respectable and happy and emma admitted her to be\\nthe luckiest creature in the world to have created so steady and\\npersevering an affection in such a manor if not quite the luckiest\\nto yield only to herself\\n\\nharriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins\\nwas less and less at hartfield which was not to be regretted\\nthe intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must\\nchange into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought\\nto be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual\\nnatural manner\\n\\nbefore the end of september emma attended harriet to church and saw\\nher hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction\\nas no remembrances

blessings\\nof existence and had lived nearly twentyone years in the world\\nwith very little to distress or vex her\\n\\nshe was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate\\nindulgent father and had in consequence of her sisters marriage\\nbeen mistress of his house from a very early period  her mother\\nhad died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct\\nremembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied\\nby an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short\\nof a mother in affection\\n\\nsixteen years had miss taylor been in mr woodhouses family\\nless as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters\\nbut particularly of emma  between them it was more the intimacy\\nof sisters  even before miss taylor had ceased to hold the nominal\\noffice of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed\\nher to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being\\nnow long passed away they had been living together as friend and\\nfriend very mutually attached and emma doing just what she liked\\nhighly esteeming miss taylors judgment but directed chiefly by\\nher own\\n\\nthe real evils indeed of emmas situation were the power of having\\nrather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little\\ntoo well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened\\nalloy to her many enjoyments  the danger however was at present\\nso unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes\\nwith her\\n\\nsorrow camea gentle sorrowbut not at all in the shape of any\\ndisagreeable consciousnessmiss taylor married  it was miss\\ntaylors loss which first brought grief  it was on the weddingday\\nof this beloved friend that emma first sat in mournful thought\\nof any continuance  the wedding over and the bridepeople gone\\nher father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect\\nof a third to cheer a long evening  her father composed himself\\nto sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit\\nand think of what she had lost\\n\\nthe event had every promise of happiness for her friend  mr weston\\nwas a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age\\nand pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering\\nwith what selfdenying generous friendship she had always wished\\nand promoted the match but it was a black mornings work for her\\nthe want of miss taylor would be felt every hour of every day\\nshe recalled her past kindnessthe kindness the affection of sixteen\\nyearshow she had taught and how she had played with her from five\\nyears oldhow she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse\\nher in healthand how nursed her through the various illnesses\\nof childhood  a large debt of gratitude was owing here but the\\nintercourse of the last seven years the equal footing and perfect\\nunreserve which had soon followed isabellas marriage on their\\nbeing left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection\\nshe had been a friend and companion such as few possessed intelligent\\nwellinformed useful gentle knowing all the ways of the family\\ninterested in all its concerns and peculiarly interested in herself\\nin every pleasure every scheme of hersone to whom she could speak\\nevery thought as it arose and who had such an affection for her\\nas could never find fault\\n\\nhow was she to bear the changeit was true that her friend was\\ngoing only half a mile from them but emma was aware that great must\\nbe the difference between a mrs weston only half a mile from them\\nand a miss taylor in the house and with all her advantages\\nnatural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering\\nfrom intellectual solitude  she dearly loved her father but he\\nwas no companion for her  he could not meet her in conversation\\nrational or playful\\n\\nthe evil of the actual disparity in their ages and mr woodhouse had\\nnot married early was much increased by his constitution and habits\\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life without activity\\nof mind or body he was a much older man in ways than in years\\nand though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart\\nand his amiable temper his talents could not have recommended him\\nat any time\\n\\nher sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony\\nbeing settled in london only sixteen miles off was much beyond\\nher daily reach and many a long october and november evening must\\nbe struggled through at hartfield before christmas brought the next\\nvisit from isabella and her husband and their little children\\nto fill the house and give her pleasant society again\\n\\nhighbury the large and populous village almost amounting to a town\\nto which hartfield in spite of its separate lawn and shrubberies\\nand name did really belong afforded her no equals  the woodhouses\\nwere first in consequence there  all looked up to them  she had\\nmany acquaintance in the place for her father was universally civil\\nbut not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of miss\\ntaylor for even half a day  it was a melancholy change and emma\\ncould not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things\\ntill her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful\\nhis spirits required support  he was a nervous man easily depressed\\nfond of every body that he was used to and hating to part with them\\nhating change of every kind  matrimony as the origin of change\\nwas always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled\\nto his own daughters marrying nor could ever speak of her but\\nwith compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection\\nwhen he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from\\nhis habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to\\nsuppose that other people could feel differently from himself\\nhe was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad\\na thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal\\nhappier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield\\nemma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him\\nfrom such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him\\nnot to say exactly as he had said at dinner\\n\\npoor miss taylori wish she were here again  what a pity it\\nis that mr weston ever thought of her\\n\\ni cannot agree with you papa you know i cannot  mr weston is such\\na goodhumoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves\\na good wifeand you would not have had miss taylor live with us\\nfor ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own\\n\\na house of her ownbut where is the advantage of a house of her own\\nthis is three times as largeand you have never any odd humours\\nmy dear\\n\\nhow often we shall be going to see them and they coming to see\\nuswe shall be always meeting we must begin we must go and pay\\nwedding visit very soon\\n\\nmy dear how am i to get so far randalls is such a distance\\ni could not walk half so far\\n\\nno papa nobody thought of your walking  we must go in the carriage\\nto be sure\\n\\nthe carriage but james will not like to put the horses to for\\nsuch a little wayand where are the poor horses to be while we\\nare paying our visit\\n\\nthey are to be put into mr westons stable papa  you know we\\nhave settled all that already  we talked it all over with mr weston\\nlast night  and as for james you may be very sure he will always like\\ngoing to randalls because of his daughters being housemaid there\\ni only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else  that was\\nyour doing papa  you got hannah that good place  nobody thought\\nof hannah till you mentioned herjames is so obliged to you\\n\\ni am very glad i did think of her  it was very lucky for i would\\nnot have had poor james think himself slighted upon any account\\nand i am sure she will make a very good servant she is a civil\\nprettyspoken girl i have a great opinion of her  whenever i see her\\nshe always curtseys and asks me how i do in a very pretty manner\\nand when you have had her here to do needlework i observe she\\nalways turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it\\ni am sure she will be an excellent servant and it will be a great\\ncomfort to poor miss taylor to have somebody about her that she is\\nused to see  whenever james goes over to see his daughter you know\\nshe will be hearing of us  he will be able to tell her how we\\nall are\\n\\nemma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas\\nand hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably\\nthrough the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own\\nthe backgammontable was placed but a visitor immediately afterwards\\nwalked in and made it unnecessary\\n\\nmr knightley a sensible man about seven or eightandthirty was not\\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family but particularly\\nconnected with it as the elder brother of isabellas husband\\nhe lived about a mile from highbury was a frequent visitor\\nand always welcome and at this time more welcome than usual\\nas coming directly from their mutual connexions in london  he had\\nreturned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked\\nup to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square\\nit was a happy circumstance and animated mr woodhouse for some time\\nmr knightley had a cheerful manner which always did him good\\nand his many inquiries after poor isabella and her children were\\nanswered most satisfactorily  when this was over mr woodhouse\\ngratefully observed it is very kind of you mr knightley to come\\nout at this late hour to call upon us  i am afraid you must have\\nhad a shocking walk\\n\\nnot at all sir  it is a beautiful moonlight night and so mild\\nthat i must draw back from your great fire\\n\\nbut you must have found it very damp and dirty  i wish you may\\nnot catch cold\\n\\ndirty sir look at my shoes  not a speck on them\\n\\nwell that is quite surprising for we have had a vast deal\\nof rain here  it rained dreadfully hard for half an hour\\nwhile we were at breakfast  i wanted them to put off the wedding\\n\\nby the byei have not wished you joy  being pretty well aware\\nof what sort of joy you must both be feeling i have been in no hurry\\nwith my congratulations but i hope it all went off tolerably well\\nhow did you all behave who cried most\\n\\nah poor miss taylor tis a sad business\\n\\npoor mr and miss woodhouse if you please but i cannot possibly\\nsay poor miss taylor i have a great regard for you and emma\\nbut when it comes to the question of dependence or independenceat\\nany rate it must be better to have only one to please than two\\n\\nespecially when one of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature\\nsaid emma playfully  that is what you have in your head\\ni knowand what you would certainly say if my father were not by\\n\\ni believe it is very true my dear indeed said mr woodhouse\\nwith a sigh  i am afraid i am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome\\n\\nmy dearest papa you do not think i could mean you or suppose\\nmr knightley to mean you  what a horrible idea oh no i meant\\nonly myself  mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know\\nin a jokeit is all a joke  we always say what we like to one another\\n\\nmr knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see\\nfaults in emma woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them\\nand though this was not particularly agreeable to emma herself\\nshe knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would\\nnot have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being\\nthought perfect by every body\\n\\nemma knows i never flatter her said mr knightley but i\\nmeant no reflection on any body  miss taylor has been used\\nto have two persons to please she will now have but one\\nthe chances are that she must be a gainer\\n\\nwell said emma willing to let it passyou want to hear\\nabout the wedding and i shall be happy to tell you for we all\\nbehaved charmingly  every body was punctual every body in their\\nbest looks not a tear and hardly a long face to be seen  oh no\\nwe all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart\\nand were sure of meeting every day\\n\\ndear emma bears every thing so well said her father\\nbut mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor\\nand i am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for\\n\\nemma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles\\nit is impossible that emma should not miss such a companion\\nsaid mr knightley  we should not like her so well as we do sir\\nif we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to\\nmiss taylors advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be\\nat miss taylors time of life to be settled in a home of her own\\nand how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision\\nand therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure\\nevery friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happily\\nmarried\\n\\nand you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma\\nand a very considerable onethat i made the match myself\\ni made the match you know four years ago and to have it take place\\nand be proved in the right when so many people said mr weston would\\nnever marry again may comfort me for any thing\\n\\nmr knightley shook his head at her  her father fondly replied\\nah my dear i wish you would not make matches and foretell things\\nfor whatever you say always comes to pass  pray do not make any\\nmore matches\\n\\ni promise you to make none for myself papa but i must indeed\\nfor other people  it is the greatest amusement in the world and\\nafter such success you knowevery body said that mr weston would\\nnever marry again  oh dear no mr weston who had been a widower\\nso long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife\\nso constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his\\nfriends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful\\nmr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did\\nnot like it  oh no mr weston certainly would never marry again\\nsome people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed\\nand others of the son and the uncle not letting him  all manner\\nof solemn nonsense was talked on the subject but i believed none\\nof it\\n\\never since the dayabout four years agothat miss taylor and i\\nmet with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle\\nhe darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas\\nfor us from farmer mitchells i made up my mind on the subject\\ni planned the match from that hour and when such success has blessed\\nme in this instance dear papa you cannot think that i shall leave\\noff matchmaking\\n\\ni do not understand what you mean by success said mr knightley\\nsuccess supposes endeavour  your time has been properly and\\ndelicately spent if you have been endeavouring for the last four\\nyears to bring about this marriage  a worthy employment for a young\\nladys mind but if which i rather imagine your making the match\\nas you call it means only your planning it your saying to yourself\\none idle day i think it would be a very good thing for miss taylor\\nif mr weston were to marry her and saying it again to yourself\\nevery now and then afterwards why do you talk of success where\\nis your merit what are you proud of you made a lucky guess\\nand that is all that can be said\\n\\nand have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess\\ni pity youi thought you clevererfor depend upon it a lucky\\nguess is never merely luck  there is always some talent in it\\nand as to my poor word success which you quarrel with i do not\\nknow that i am so entirely without any claim to it  you have drawn\\ntwo pretty pictures but i think there may be a thirda something\\nbetween the donothing and the doall if i had not promoted mr westons\\nvisits here and given many little encouragements and smoothed\\nmany little matters it might not have come to any thing after all\\ni think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that\\n\\na straightforward openhearted man like weston and a rational\\nunaffected woman like miss taylor may be safely left to manage their\\nown concerns  you are more likely to have done harm to yourself\\nthan good to them by interference\\n\\nemma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others\\nrejoined mr woodhouse understanding but in part  but my dear\\npray do not make any more matches they are silly things and break up\\nones family circle grievously\\n\\nonly one more papa only for mr elton  poor mr elton you\\nlike mr elton papai must look about for a wife for him\\nthere is nobody in highbury who deserves himand he has been\\nhere a whole year and has fitted up his house so comfortably\\nthat it would be a shame to have him single any longerand i thought\\nwhen he was joining their hands today he looked so very much as if\\nhe would like to have the same kind office done for him i think\\nvery well of mr elton and this is the only way i have of doing\\nhim a service\\n\\nmr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very\\ngood young man and i have a great regard for him  but if you\\nwant to shew him any attention my dear ask him to come\\nand dine with us some day  that will be a much better thing\\ni dare say mr knightley will be so kind as to meet him\\n\\nwith a great deal of pleasure sir at any time said mr knightley\\nlaughing and i agree with you entirely that it will be a much\\nbetter thing  invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best\\nof the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife\\ndepend upon it a man of six or sevenandtwenty can take care\\nof himself\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii\\n\\n\\nmr weston was a native of highbury and born of a respectable family\\nwhich for the last two or three generations had been rising into\\ngentility and property  he had received a good education but\\non succeeding early in life to a small independence had become\\nindisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers\\nwere engaged and had satisfied an active cheerful mind and social\\ntemper by entering into the militia of his county then embodied\\n\\ncaptain weston was a general favourite and when the chances\\nof his military life had introduced him to miss churchill\\nof a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love\\nwith him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife\\nwho had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance\\nwhich the connexion would offend\\n\\nmiss churchill however being of age and with the full command\\nof her fortunethough her fortune bore no proportion to the\\nfamilyestatewas not to be dissuaded from the marriage and it\\ntook place to the infinite mortification of mr and mrs churchill\\nwho threw her off with due decorum  it was an unsuitable connexion\\nand did not produce much happiness  mrs weston ought to have found\\nmore in it for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper\\nmade him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness\\nof being in love with him but though she had one sort of spirit\\nshe had not the best  she had resolution enough to pursue\\nher own will in spite of her brother but not enough to refrain\\nfrom unreasonable regrets at that brothers unreasonable anger\\nnor from missing the luxuries of her former home  they lived beyond\\ntheir income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe\\nshe did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once\\nto be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe\\n\\ncaptain weston who had been considered especially by the churchills\\nas making such an amazing match was proved to have much the worst\\nof the bargain for when his wife died after a three years marriage\\nhe was rather a poorer man than at first and with a child to maintain\\nfrom the expense of the child however he was soon relieved\\nthe boy had with the additional softening claim of a lingering\\nillness of his mothers been the means of a sort of reconciliation\\nand mr and mrs churchill having no children of their own\\nnor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for offered to\\ntake the whole charge of the little frank soon after her decease\\nsome scruples and some reluctance the widowerfather may be supposed\\nto have felt but as they were overcome by other considerations\\nthe child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills\\nand he had only his own comfort to seek and his own situation to\\nimprove as he could\\n\\na complete change of life became desirable  he quitted the militia\\nand engaged in trade having brothers already established in a\\ngood way in london which afforded him a favourable opening\\nit was a concern which brought just employment enough  he had still\\na small house in highbury where most of his leisure days were spent\\nand between useful occupation and the pleasures of society\\nthe next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away\\nhe had by that time realised an easy competenceenough to secure\\nthe purchase of a little estate adjoining highbury which he had\\nalways longed forenough to marry a woman as portionless even\\nas miss taylor and to live according to the wishes of his own\\nfriendly and social disposition\\n\\nit was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence\\nhis schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth\\non youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling\\ntill he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long\\nlooked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects\\nin view till they were accomplished  he had made his fortune\\nbought his house and obtained his wife and was beginning a new\\nperiod of existence with every probability of greater happiness\\nthan in any yet passed through  he had never been an unhappy man\\nhis own temper had secured him from that even in his first marriage\\nbut his second must shew him how delightful a welljudging and truly\\namiable woman could be and must give him the pleasantest proof\\nof its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen\\nto excite gratitude than to feel it\\n\\nhe had only himself to please in his choice his fortune was\\nhis own for as to frank it was more than being tacitly brought\\nup as his uncles heir it had become so avowed an adoption\\nas to have him assume the name of churchill on coming of age\\nit was most unlikely therefore that he should ever want his\\nfathers assistance  his father had no apprehension of it\\nthe aunt was a capricious woman and governed her husband entirely\\nbut it was not in mr westons nature to imagine that any caprice\\ncould be strong enough to affect one so dear and as he believed\\nso deservedly dear  he saw his son every year in london\\nand was proud of him and his fond report of him as a very fine\\nyoung man had made highbury feel a sort of pride in him too\\nhe was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his\\nmerits and prospects a kind of common concern\\n\\nmr frank churchill was one of the boasts of highbury and a lively\\ncuriosity to see him prevailed though the compliment was so little\\nreturned that he had never been there in his life  his coming\\nto visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved\\n\\nnow upon his fathers marriage it was very generally proposed\\nas a most proper attention that the visit should take place\\nthere was not a dissentient voice on the subject either when\\nmrs perry drank tea with mrs and miss bates or when mrs and\\nmiss bates returned the visit  now was the time for mr frank\\nchurchill to come among them and the hope strengthened when it was\\nunderstood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion\\nfor a few days every morning visit in highbury included some mention\\nof the handsome letter mrs weston had received  i suppose you\\nhave heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written\\nto mrs weston i understand it was a very handsome letter indeed\\nmr woodhouse told me of it  mr woodhouse saw the letter and he\\nsays he never saw such a handsome letter in his life\\n\\nit was indeed a highly prized letter  mrs weston had of course\\nformed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing\\nattention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense\\nand a most welcome addition to every source and every expression\\nof congratulation which her marriage had already secured  she felt\\nherself a most fortunate woman and she had lived long enough\\nto know how fortunate she might well be thought where the only\\nregret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship\\nfor her had never cooled and who could ill bear to part with her\\n\\nshe knew that at times she must be missed and could not think\\nwithout pain of emmas losing a single pleasure or suffering\\nan hours ennui from the want of her companionableness but dear\\nemma was of no feeble character she was more equal to her situation\\nthan most girls would have been and had sense and energy\\nand spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily\\nthrough its little difficulties and privations  and then there was\\nsuch comfort in the very easy distance of randalls from hartfield\\nso convenient for even solitary female walking and in mr westons\\ndisposition and circumstances which would make the approaching\\nseason no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the\\nweek together\\n\\nher situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude\\nto mrs weston and of moments only of regret and her\\nsatisfactionher more than satisfactionher cheerful enjoyment\\nwas so just and so apparent that emma well as she knew her father\\nwas sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity\\npoor miss taylor when they left her at randalls in the centre\\nof every domestic comfort or saw her go away in the evening\\nattended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own\\nbut never did she go without mr woodhouses giving a gentle sigh\\nand saying ah poor miss taylor she would be very glad to stay\\n\\nthere was no recovering miss taylornor much likelihood of\\nceasing to pity her but a few weeks brought some alleviation\\nto mr woodhouse  the compliments of his neighbours were over\\nhe was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event\\nand the weddingcake which had been a great distress to him\\nwas all eat up  his own stomach could bear nothing rich and he\\ncould never believe other people to be different from himself\\nwhat was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body\\nand he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having\\nany weddingcake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly\\ntried to prevent any bodys eating it  he had been at the pains\\nof consulting mr perry the apothecary on the subject  mr perry\\nwas an intelligent gentlemanlike man whose frequent visits were one\\nof the comforts of mr woodhouses life and upon being applied to\\nhe could not but acknowledge though it seemed rather against the\\nbias of inclination that weddingcake might certainly disagree\\nwith manyperhaps with most people unless taken moderately\\nwith such an opinion in confirmation of his own mr woodhouse hoped\\nto influence every visitor of the newly married pair but still the\\ncake was eaten and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till\\nit was all gone\\n\\nthere was a strange rumour in highbury of all the little perrys\\nbeing seen with a slice of mrs westons weddingcake in their\\nhands but mr woodhouse would never believe it\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii\\n\\n\\nmr woodhouse was fond of society in his own way  he liked very much\\nto have his friends come and see him and from various united causes\\nfrom his long residence at hartfield and his good nature\\nfrom his fortune his house and his daughter he could command the\\nvisits of his own little circle in a great measure as he liked\\nhe had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle\\nhis horror of late hours and large dinnerparties made him unfit\\nfor any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms\\nfortunately for him highbury including randalls in the same parish\\nand donwell abbey in the parish adjoining the seat of mr knightley\\ncomprehended many such  not unfrequently through emmas persuasion\\nhe had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening\\nparties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any\\ntime unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week\\nin which emma could not make up a cardtable for him\\n\\nreal longstanding regard brought the westons and mr knightley\\nand by mr elton a young man living alone without liking it\\nthe privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude\\nfor the elegancies and society of mr woodhouses drawingroom\\nand the smiles of his lovely daughter was in no danger of being\\nthrown away\\n\\nafter these came a second set among the most comeatable\\nof whom were mrs and miss bates and mrs goddard three ladies\\nalmost always at the service of an invitation from hartfield\\nand who were fetched and carried home so often that mr woodhouse\\nthought it no hardship for either james or the horses  had it\\ntaken place only once a year it would have been a grievance\\n\\nmrs bates the widow of a former vicar of highbury was a\\nvery old lady almost past every thing but tea and quadrille\\nshe lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was\\nconsidered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady\\nunder such untoward circumstances can excite  her daughter enjoyed\\na most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young\\nhandsome rich nor married  miss bates stood in the very worst\\npredicament in the world for having much of the public favour\\nand she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself\\nor frighten those who might hate her into outward respect\\nshe had never boasted either beauty or cleverness  her youth\\nhad passed without distinction and her middle of life was devoted\\nto the care of a failing mother and the endeavour to make a small\\nincome go as far as possible  and yet she was a happy woman\\nand a woman whom no one named without goodwill  it was her own\\nuniversal goodwill and contented temper which worked such wonders\\nshe loved every body was interested in every bodys happiness\\nquicksighted to every bodys merits thought herself a most fortunate\\ncreature and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother\\nand so many good neighbours and friends and a home that wanted\\nfor nothing  the simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature\\nher contented and grateful spirit were a recommendation to every body\\nand a mine of felicity to herself  she was a great talker upon\\nlittle matters which exactly suited mr woodhouse full of trivial\\ncommunications and harmless gossip\\n\\nmrs goddard was the mistress of a schoolnot of a seminary\\nor an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of\\nrefined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality\\nupon new principles and new systemsand where young ladies for\\nenormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanitybut\\na real honest oldfashioned boardingschool where a reasonable\\nquantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price\\nand where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble\\nthemselves into a little education without any danger of coming\\nback prodigies  mrs goddards school was in high reputeand\\nvery deservedly for highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy\\nspot she had an ample house and garden gave the children plenty\\nof wholesome food let them run about a great deal in the summer\\nand in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands\\nit was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\\nafter her to church  she was a plain motherly kind of woman\\nwho had worked hard in her youth and now thought herself entitled\\nto the occasional holiday of a teavisit and having formerly\\nowed much to mr woodhouses kindness felt his particular claim\\non her to leave her neat parlour hung round with fancywork\\nwhenever she could and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside\\n\\nthese were the ladies whom emma found herself very frequently\\nable to collect and happy was she for her fathers sake\\nin the power though as far as she was herself concerned\\nit was no remedy for the absence of mrs weston  she was delighted\\nto see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with\\nherself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings\\nof three such women made her feel that every evening so spent\\nwas indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated\\n\\nas she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close\\nof the present day a note was brought from mrs goddard requesting\\nin most respectful terms to be allowed to bring miss smith with her\\na most welcome request for miss smith was a girl of seventeen\\nwhom emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in\\non account of her beauty  a very gracious invitation was returned\\nand the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion\\n\\nharriet smith was the natural daughter of somebody  somebody had\\nplaced her several years back at mrs goddards school\\nand somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar\\nto that of parlourboarder this was all that was generally known\\nof her history  she had no visible friends but what had been\\nacquired at highbury and was now just returned from a long visit\\nin the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her\\n\\nshe was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort\\nwhich emma particularly admired  she was short plump and fair\\nwith a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features\\nand a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening\\nemma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite\\ndetermined to continue the acquaintance\\n\\nshe was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in miss smiths\\nconversation but she found her altogether very engagingnot\\ninconveniently shy not unwilling to talkand yet so far from pushing\\nshewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly\\ngrateful for being admitted to hartfield and so artlessly\\nimpressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style\\nto what she had been used to that she must have good sense\\nand deserve encouragement  encouragement should be given\\nthose soft blue eyes and all those natural graces should not be\\nwasted on the inferior society of highbury and its connexions\\nthe acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her\\nthe friends from whom she had just parted though very good sort\\nof people must be doing her harm  they were a family of the name\\nof martin whom emma well knew by character as renting a large farm\\nof mr knightley and residing in the parish of donwellvery creditably\\nshe believedshe knew mr knightley thought highly of thembut they\\nmust be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates\\nof a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\\nto be quite perfect  she would notice her she would improve her\\nshe would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her\\ninto good society she would form her opinions and her manners\\nit would be an interesting and certainly a very kind undertaking\\nhighly becoming her own situation in life her leisure and powers\\n\\nshe was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes in talking\\nand listening and forming all these schemes in the inbetweens that\\nthe evening flew away at a very unusual rate and the suppertable\\nwhich always closed such parties and for which she had been\\nused to sit and watch the due time was all set out and ready\\nand moved forwards to the fire before she was aware  with an\\nalacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never\\nindifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively\\nwith the real goodwill of a mind delighted with its own ideas\\ndid she then do all the honours of the meal and help and recommend\\nthe minced chicken and scalloped oysters with an urgency which she\\nknew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests\\n\\nupon such occasions poor mr woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare\\nhe loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion\\nof his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome\\nmade him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his\\nhospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing\\nhis care for their health made him grieve that they would eat\\n\\nsuch another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that\\nhe could with thorough selfapprobation recommend though he\\nmight constrain himself while the ladies were comfortably clearing\\nthe nicer things to say\\n\\nmrs bates let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs\\nan egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome  serle understands boiling\\nan egg better than any body  i would not recommend an egg boiled\\nby any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small\\nyou seeone of our small eggs will not hurt you  miss bates\\nlet emma help you to a little bit of tarta very little bit\\nours are all appletarts you need not be afraid of unwholesome\\npreserves here  i do not advise the custard  mrs goddard what say\\nyou to half a glass of wine a small halfglass put into a tumbler\\nof water i do not think it could disagree with you\\n\\nemma allowed her father to talkbut supplied her visitors in\\na much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had\\nparticular pleasure in sending them away happy  the happiness\\nof miss smith was quite equal to her intentions  miss woodhouse\\nwas so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the\\nintroduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble\\ngrateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings\\ndelighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated\\nher all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv\\n\\n\\nharriet smiths intimacy at hartfield was soon a settled thing\\nquick and decided in her ways emma lost no time in inviting encouraging\\nand telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased\\nso did their satisfaction in each other  as a walking companion\\nemma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her\\nin that respect mrs westons loss had been important  her father\\nnever went beyond the shrubbery where two divisions of the ground\\nsufficed him for his long walk or his short as the year varied\\nand since mrs westons marriage her exercise had been too much confined\\nshe had ventured once alone to randalls but it was not pleasant\\nand a harriet smith therefore one whom she could summon at any\\ntime to a walk would be a valuable addition to her privileges\\nbut in every respect as she saw more of her she approved her\\nand was confirmed in all her kind designs\\n\\nharriet certainly was not clever but she had a sweet docile\\ngrateful disposition was totally free from conceit and only desiring\\nto be guided by any one she looked up to  her early attachment\\nto herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company\\nand power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that\\nthere was no want of taste though strength of understanding must\\nnot be expected  altogether she was quite convinced of harriet\\nsmiths being exactly the young friend she wantedexactly the\\nsomething which her home required  such a friend as mrs weston\\nwas out of the question  two such could never be granted\\ntwo such she did not want  it was quite a different sort of thing\\na sentiment distinct and independent  mrs weston was the object\\nof a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem\\nharriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful\\nfor mrs weston there was nothing to be done for harriet every thing\\n\\nher first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\\nwere the parents but harriet could not tell  she was ready to tell\\nevery thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain\\nemma was obliged to fancy what she likedbut she could never\\nbelieve that in the same situation she should not have discovered\\nthe truth  harriet had no penetration  she had been satisfied\\nto hear and believe just what mrs goddard chose to tell her\\nand looked no farther\\n\\nmrs goddard and the teachers and the girls and the affairs of the\\nschool in general formed naturally a great part of the conversationand\\nbut for her acquaintance with the martins of abbeymill farm\\nit must have been the whole  but the martins occupied her thoughts\\na good deal she had spent two very happy months with them\\nand now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe\\nthe many comforts and wonders of the place  emma encouraged her\\ntalkativenessamused by such a picture of another set of beings\\nand enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\\nexultation of mrs martins having two parlours two very good parlours\\nindeed one of them quite as large as mrs goddards drawingroom\\nand of her having an upper maid who had lived fiveandtwenty years\\nwith her and of their having eight cows two of them alderneys\\nand one a little welch cow a very pretty little welch cow indeed\\nand of mrs martins saying as she was so fond of it it should be\\ncalled her cow and of their having a very handsome summerhouse\\nin their garden where some day next year they were all to drink\\nteaa very handsome summerhouse large enough to hold a dozen people\\n\\nfor some time she was amused without thinking beyond the immediate cause\\nbut as she came to understand the family better other feelings arose\\nshe had taken up a wrong idea fancying it was a mother and daughter\\na son and sons wife who all lived together but when it appeared\\nthat the mr martin who bore a part in the narrative and was always\\nmentioned with approbation for his great goodnature in doing something\\nor other was a single man that there was no young mrs martin\\nno wife in the case she did suspect danger to her poor little\\nfriend from all this hospitality and kindness and that if she\\nwere not taken care of she might be required to sink herself forever\\n\\nwith this inspiriting notion her questions increased in number\\nand meaning and she particularly led harriet to talk more of mr martin\\nand there was evidently no dislike to it  harriet was very ready\\nto speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry\\nevening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very goodhumoured\\nand obliging  he had gone three miles round one day in order to bring\\nher some walnuts because she had said how fond she was of them\\nand in every thing else he was so very obliging  he had his\\nshepherds son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her\\nshe was very fond of singing  he could sing a little himself\\nshe believed he was very clever and understood every thing\\nhe had a very fine flock and while she was with them\\nhe had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country\\nshe believed every body spoke well of him  his mother and sisters\\nwere very fond of him  mrs martin had told her one day and there\\nwas a blush as she said it that it was impossible for any body\\nto be a better son and therefore she was sure whenever he married\\nhe would make a good husband  not that she wanted him to marry\\nshe was in no hurry at all\\n\\nwell done mrs martin thought emma  you know what you are about\\n\\nand when she had come away mrs martin was so very kind as to send\\nmrs goddard a beautiful goosethe finest goose mrs goddard had\\never seen  mrs goddard had dressed it on a sunday and asked all\\nthe three teachers miss nash and miss prince and miss richardson\\nto sup with her\\n\\nmr martin i suppose is not a man of information beyond the line\\nof his own business he does not read\\n\\noh yesthat is noi do not knowbut i believe he has\\nread a good dealbut not what you would think any thing of\\nhe reads the agricultural reports and some other books that lay\\nin one of the window seatsbut he reads all them to himself\\nbut sometimes of an evening before we went to cards he would read\\nsomething aloud out of the elegant extracts very entertaining\\nand i know he has read the vicar of wakefield  he never read the\\nromance of the forest nor the children of the abbey  he had never\\nheard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined\\nto get them now as soon as ever he can\\n\\nthe next question was\\n\\nwhat sort of looking man is mr martin\\n\\noh not handsomenot at all handsome  i thought him very plain\\nat first but i do not think him so plain now  one does not you know\\nafter a time  but did you never see him he is in highbury every\\nnow and then and he is sure to ride through every week in his way\\nto kingston  he has passed you very often\\n\\nthat may be and i may have seen him fifty times but without\\nhaving any idea of his name  a young farmer whether on horseback\\nor on foot is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity\\nthe yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom i feel i\\ncan have nothing to do  a degree or two lower and a creditable\\nappearance might interest me i might hope to be useful to their\\nfamilies in some way or other  but a farmer can need none of my help\\nand is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every\\nother he is below it\\n\\nto be sure  oh yes it is not likely you should ever have\\nobserved him but he knows you very well indeedi mean by sight\\n\\ni have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man\\ni know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well\\nwhat do you imagine his age to be\\n\\nhe was fourandtwenty the 8th of last june and my birthday is\\nthe 23rd just a fortnight and a days differencewhich is very odd\\n\\nonly fourandtwenty that is too young to settle  his mother is\\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry  they seem very comfortable\\nas they are and if she were to take any pains to marry him\\nshe would probably repent it  six years hence if he could meet\\nwith a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own\\nwith a little money it might be very desirable\\n\\nsix years hence dear miss woodhouse he would be thirty years old\\n\\nwell and that is as early as most men can afford to marry\\nwho are not born to an independence  mr martin i imagine\\nhas his fortune entirely to makecannot be at all beforehand with\\nthe world  whatever money he might come into when his father died\\nwhatever his share of the family property it is i dare say\\nall afloat all employed in his stock and so forth and though\\nwith diligence and good luck he may be rich in time it is next to\\nimpossible that he should have realised any thing yet\\n\\nto be sure so it is  but they live very comfortably\\nthey have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing\\nand mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year\\n\\ni wish you may not get into a scrape harriet whenever he does\\nmarryi mean as to being acquainted with his wifefor though\\nhis sisters from a superior education are not to be altogether\\nobjected to it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit\\nfor you to notice  the misfortune of your birth ought to make you\\nparticularly careful as to your associates  there can be no doubt\\nof your being a gentlemans daughter and you must support your\\nclaim to that station by every thing within your own power or there\\nwill be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you\\n\\nyes to be sure i suppose there are  but while i visit\\nat hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse\\ni am not afraid of what any body can do\\n\\nyou understand the force of influence pretty well harriet but i\\nwould have you so firmly established in good society as to be\\nindependent even of hartfield and miss woodhouse  i want to see you\\npermanently well connected and to that end it will be advisable\\nto have as few odd acquaintance as may be and therefore i say\\nthat if you should still be in this country when mr martin marries\\ni wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters\\nto be acquainted with the wife who will probably be some mere\\nfarmers daughter without education\\n\\nto be sure  yes  not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body\\nbut what had had some educationand been very well brought up\\nhowever i do not mean to set up my opinion against yoursand i\\nam sure i shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife  i shall\\nalways have a great regard for the miss martins especially elizabeth\\nand should be very sorry to give them up for they are quite as well\\neducated as me  but if he marries a very ignorant vulgar woman\\ncertainly i had better not visit her if i can help it\\n\\nemma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech\\nand saw no alarming symptoms of love  the young man had been\\nthe first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold\\nand that there would be no serious difficulty on harriets side\\nto oppose any friendly arrangement of her own\\n\\nthey met mr martin the very next day as they were walking on the\\ndonwell road  he was on foot and after looking very respectfully\\nat her looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion\\nemma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey\\nand walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made\\nher quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr robert martin\\nhis appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man\\nbut his person had no other advantage and when he came to be\\ncontrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground\\nhe had gained in harriets inclination  harriet was not insensible\\nof manner she had voluntarily noticed her fathers gentleness\\nwith admiration as well as wonder  mr martin looked as if he\\ndid not know what manner was\\n\\nthey remained but a few minutes together as miss woodhouse must\\nnot be kept waiting and harriet then came running to her with a\\nsmiling face and in a flutter of spirits which miss woodhouse\\nhoped very soon to compose\\n\\nonly think of our happening to meet himhow very odd it was\\nquite a chance he said that he had not gone round by randalls\\nhe did not think we ever walked this road  he thought we walked\\ntowards randalls most days  he has not been able to get the\\nromance of the forest yet  he was so busy the last time he was\\nat kingston that he quite forgot it but he goes again tomorrow\\nso very odd we should happen to meet well miss woodhouse is he\\nlike what you expected what do you think of him do you think him\\nso very plain\\n\\nhe is very plain undoubtedlyremarkably plainbut that is\\nnothing compared with his entire want of gentility  i had no\\nright to expect much and i did not expect much but i had no\\nidea that he could be so very clownish so totally without air\\ni had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility\\n\\nto be sure said harriet in a mortified voice he is not\\nso genteel as real gentlemen\\n\\ni think harriet since your acquaintance with us you have been\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen\\nthat you must yourself be struck with the difference in mr martin\\nat hartfield you have had very good specimens of well educated\\nwell bred men  i should be surprized if after seeing them\\nyou could be in company with mr martin again without perceiving\\nhim to be a very inferior creatureand rather wondering at\\nyourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before\\ndo not you begin to feel that now were not you struck i am sure\\nyou must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner\\nand the uncouthness of a voice which i heard to be wholly unmodulated\\nas i stood here\\n\\ncertainly he is not like mr knightley  he has not such a fine\\nair and way of walking as mr knightley  i see the difference\\nplain enough  but mr knightley is so very fine a man\\n\\nmr knightleys air is so remarkably good that it is not fair\\nto compare mr martin with him  you might not see one in a hundred\\nwith gentleman so plainly written as in mr knightley  but he is\\nnot the only gentleman you have been lately used to  what say you\\nto mr weston and mr elton compare mr martin with either of them\\ncompare their manner of carrying themselves of walking of speaking\\nof being silent  you must see the difference\\n\\noh yesthere is a great difference  but mr weston is almost\\nan old man  mr weston must be between forty and fifty\\n\\nwhich makes his good manners the more valuable  the older a\\nperson grows harriet the more important it is that their manners\\nshould not be bad the more glaring and disgusting any loudness\\nor coarseness or awkwardness becomes  what is passable in youth\\nis detestable in later age  mr martin is now awkward and abrupt\\nwhat will he be at mr westons time of life\\n\\nthere is no saying indeed replied harriet rather solemnly\\n\\nbut there may be pretty good guessing  he will be a completely gross\\nvulgar farmer totally inattentive to appearances and thinking\\nof nothing but profit and loss\\n\\nwill he indeed that will be very bad\\n\\nhow much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended\\nhe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\nelsewhich is just as it should be for a thriving man  what has\\nhe to do with books and i have no doubt that he will thrive\\nand be a very rich man in timeand his being illiterate and coarse\\nneed not disturb us\\n\\ni wonder he did not remember the bookwas all harriets answer\\nand spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might\\nbe safely left to itself  she therefore said no more for some time\\nher next beginning was\\n\\nin one respect perhaps mr eltons manners are superior\\nto mr knightleys or mr westons they have more gentleness\\nthey might be more safely held up as a pattern  there is an openness\\na quickness almost a bluntness in mr weston which every body\\nlikes in him because there is so much goodhumour with itbut\\nthat would not do to be copied  neither would mr knightleys\\ndownright decided commanding sort of manner though it suits\\nhim very well his figure and look and situation in life seem\\nto allow it but if any young man were to set about copying him\\nhe would not be sufferable  on the contrary i think a young man\\nmight be very safely recommended to take mr elton as a model\\nmr elton is goodhumoured cheerful obliging and gentle\\nhe seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late  i do not\\nknow whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either\\nof us harriet by additional softness but it strikes me that his\\nmanners are softer than they used to be  if he means any thing\\nit must be to please you  did not i tell you what he said of you\\nthe other day\\n\\nshe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn\\nfrom mr elton and now did full justice to and harriet blushed\\nand smiled and said she had always thought mr elton very agreeable\\n\\nmr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving\\nthe young farmer out of harriets head  she thought it would\\nbe an excellent match and only too palpably desirable natural\\nand probable for her to have much merit in planning it\\nshe feared it was what every body else must think of and predict\\nit was not likely however that any body should have equalled\\nher in the date of the plan as it had entered her brain during\\nthe very first evening of harriets coming to hartfield  the longer\\nshe considered it the greater was her sense of its expediency\\nmr eltons situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself\\nand without low connexions at the same time not of any family\\nthat could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet  he had a\\ncomfortable home for her and emma imagined a very sufficient income\\nfor though the vicarage of highbury was not large he was known\\nto have some independent property and she thought very highly\\nof him as a goodhumoured wellmeaning respectable young man\\nwithout any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world\\n\\nshe had already satisfied herself that he thought harriet a beautiful\\ngirl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at hartfield\\nwas foundation enough on his side and on harriets there could be\\nlittle doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all\\nthe usual weight and efficacy  and he was really a very pleasing\\nyoung man a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like\\nhe was reckoned very handsome his person much admired in general\\nthough not by her there being a want of elegance of feature which\\nshe could not dispense withbut the girl who could be gratified\\nby a robert martins riding about the country to get walnuts\\nfor her might very well be conquered by mr eltons admiration\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v\\n\\n\\ni do not know what your opinion may be mrs weston said mr knightley of\\nthis great intimacy between emma and harriet smith but i think it a bad thing\\n\\na bad thing do you really think it a bad thingwhy so\\n\\ni think they will neither of them do the other any good\\n\\nyou surprize me emma must do harriet good and by supplying her\\nwith a new object of interest harriet may be said to do emma good\\ni have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure\\nhow very differently we feelnot think they will do each other any\\ngood this will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels\\nabout emma mr knightley\\n\\nperhaps you think i am come on purpose to quarrel with you\\nknowing weston to be out and that you must still fight your own battle\\n\\nmr weston would undoubtedly support me if he were here\\nfor he thinks exactly as i do on the subject  we were speaking\\nof it only yesterday and agreeing how fortunate it was for emma\\nthat there should be such a girl in highbury for her to associate with\\nmr knightley i shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case\\nyou are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value\\nof a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort\\na woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used\\nto it all her life  i can imagine your objection to harriet smith\\nshe is not the superior young woman which emmas friend ought to be\\nbut on the other hand as emma wants to see her better informed\\nit will be an inducement to her to read more herself  they will\\nread together  she means it i know\\n\\nemma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve\\nyears old  i have seen a great many lists of her drawingup at\\nvarious times of books that she meant to read regularly throughand\\nvery good lists they werevery well chosen and very neatly\\narrangedsometimes alphabetically and sometimes by some other rule\\nthe list she drew up when only fourteeni remember thinking it\\ndid her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time\\nand i dare say she may have made out a very good list now  but i\\nhave done with expecting any course of steady reading from emma\\nshe will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience\\nand a subjection of the fancy to the understanding  where miss taylor\\nfailed to stimulate i may safely affirm that harriet smith will do\\nnothingyou never could persuade her to read half so much as you\\nwishedyou know you could not\\n\\ni dare say replied mrs weston smiling that i thought\\nso thenbut since we have parted i can never remember emmas\\nomitting to do any thing i wished\\n\\nthere is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as thatsaid\\nmr knightley feelingly and for a moment or two he had done  but i\\nhe soon added who have had no such charm thrown over my senses\\nmust still see hear and remember  emma is spoiled by being the\\ncleverest of her family  at ten years old she had the misfortune of\\nbeing able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen\\nshe was always quick and assured isabella slow and diffident\\nand ever since she was twelve emma has been mistress of the house\\nand of you all  in her mother she lost the only person able to cope\\nwith her  she inherits her mothers talents and must have been\\nunder subjection to her\\n\\ni should have been sorry mr knightley to be dependent on\\nyour recommendation had i quitted mr woodhouses family and wanted\\nanother situation i do not think you would have spoken a good word for\\nme to any body  i am sure you always thought me unfit for the office i held\\n\\nyes said he smiling  you are better placed here very fit\\nfor a wife but not at all for a governess  but you were preparing\\nyourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield\\nyou might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would\\nseem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her\\non the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will\\nand doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend\\nhim a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor\\n\\nthank you  there will be very little merit in making a good wife\\nto such a man as mr weston\\n\\nwhy to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away\\nand that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing\\nto be borne  we will not despair however  weston may grow cross\\nfrom the wantonness of comfort or his son may plague him\\n\\ni hope not thatit is not likely  no mr knightley do not\\nforetell vexation from that quarter\\n\\nnot i indeed  i only name possibilities  i do not pretend to emmas\\ngenius for foretelling and guessing  i hope with all my heart\\nthe young man may be a weston in merit and a churchill in fortunebut\\nharriet smithi have not half done about harriet smith  i think\\nher the very worst sort of companion that emma could possibly have\\nshe knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing\\nshe is a flatterer in all her ways and so much the worse\\nbecause undesigned  her ignorance is hourly flattery  how can\\nemma imagine she has any thing to learn herself while harriet\\nis presenting such a delightful inferiority and as for harriet\\ni will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance\\nhartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places\\nshe belongs to  she will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable\\nwith those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home\\ni am much mistaken if emmas doctrines give any strength of mind\\nor tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties\\nof her situation in lifethey only give a little polish\\n\\ni either depend more upon emmas good sense than you do or am more\\nanxious for her present comfort for i cannot lament the acquaintance\\nhow well she looked last night\\n\\noh you would rather talk of her person than her mind would you\\nvery well i shall not attempt to deny emmas being pretty\\n\\npretty say beautiful rather  can you imagine any thing nearer\\nperfect beauty than emma altogetherface and figure\\n\\ni do not know what i could imagine but i confess that i have\\nseldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers\\nbut i am a partial old friend\\n\\nsuch an eyethe true hazle eyeand so brilliant regular features\\nopen countenance with a complexion oh what a bloom of full health\\nand such a pretty height and size such a firm and upright figure\\nthere is health not merely in her bloom but in her air her head\\nher glance  one hears sometimes of a child being the picture\\nof health now emma always gives me the idea of being the complete\\npicture of grownup health  she is loveliness itself  mr knightley\\nis not she\\n\\ni have not a fault to find with her person he replied\\ni think her all you describe  i love to look at her and i\\nwill add this praise that i do not think her personally vain\\nconsidering how very handsome she is she appears to be little\\noccupied with it her vanity lies another way  mrs weston i am\\nnot to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread\\nof its doing them both harm\\n\\nand i mr knightley am equally stout in my confidence of its\\nnot doing them any harm  with all dear emmas little faults\\nshe is an excellent creature  where shall we see a better daughter\\nor a kinder sister or a truer friend no no she has qualities\\nwhich may be trusted she will never lead any one really wrong\\nshe will make no lasting blunder where emma errs once she is in the\\nright a hundred times\\n\\nvery well i will not plague you any more  emma shall be an angel\\nand i will keep my spleen to myself till christmas brings john\\nand isabella  john loves emma with a reasonable and therefore\\nnot a blind affection and isabella always thinks as he does\\nexcept when he is not quite frightened enough about the children\\ni am sure of having their opinions with me\\n\\ni know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind\\nbut excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself\\nyou know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emmas\\nmother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think\\nany possible good can arise from harriet smiths intimacy being made\\na matter of much discussion among you  pray excuse me but supposing\\nany little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy\\nit cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father\\nwho perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it\\nso long as it is a source of pleasure to herself  it has been so\\nmany years my province to give advice that you cannot be surprized\\nmr knightley at this little remains of office\\n\\nnot at all cried he i am much obliged to you for it\\nit is very good advice and it shall have a better fate than your\\nadvice has often found for it shall be attended to\\n\\nmrs john knightley is easily alarmed and might be made unhappy\\nabout her sister\\n\\nbe satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry  i will keep\\nmy illhumour to myself  i have a very sincere interest in emma\\nisabella does not seem more my sister has never excited a\\ngreater interest perhaps hardly so great  there is an anxiety\\na curiosity in what one feels for emma  i wonder what will become\\nof her\\n\\nso do i said mrs weston gently very much\\n\\nshe always declares she will never marry which of course\\nmeans just nothing at all  but i have no idea that she has yet\\never seen a man she cared for  it would not be a bad thing for her\\nto be very much in love with a proper object  i should like to see\\nemma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good\\nbut there is nobody hereabouts to attach her and she goes so seldom\\nfrom home\\n\\nthere does indeed seem as little to tempt her to break\\nher resolution at present said mrs weston as can well be\\nand while she is so happy at hartfield i cannot wish her to be\\nforming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties\\non poor mr woodhouses account  i do not recommend matrimony\\nat present to emma though i mean no slight to the state i assure you\\n\\npart of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of\\nher own and mr westons on the subject as much as possible\\nthere were wishes at randalls respecting emmas destiny but it\\nwas not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition\\nwhich mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston\\nthink of the weather shall we have rain convinced her that he\\nhad nothing more to say or surmise about hartfield\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi\\n\\n\\nemma could not feel a doubt of having given harriets fancy\\na proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity\\nto a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible\\nthan before of mr eltons being a remarkably handsome man with most\\nagreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up\\nthe assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon\\npretty confident of creating as much liking on harriets side\\nas there could be any occasion for  she was quite convinced\\nof mr eltons being in the fairest way of falling in love\\nif not in love already  she had no scruple with regard to him\\nhe talked of harriet and praised her so warmly that she could\\nnot suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add\\nhis perception of the striking improvement of harriets manner\\nsince her introduction at hartfield was not one of the least\\nagreeable proofs of his growing attachment\\n\\nyou have given miss smith all that she required said he\\nyou have made her graceful and easy  she was a beautiful creature\\nwhen she came to you but in my opinion the attractions you have\\nadded are infinitely superior to what she received from nature\\n\\ni am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet\\nonly wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints\\nshe had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness\\nin herself  i have done very little\\n\\nif it were admissible to contradict a lady said the gallant\\nmr elton\\n\\ni have perhaps given her a little more decision of character\\nhave taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her\\nway before\\n\\nexactly so that is what principally strikes me  so much superadded\\ndecision of character skilful has been the hand\\n\\ngreat has been the pleasure i am sure  i never met with\\na disposition more truly amiable\\n\\ni have no doubt of it and it was spoken with a sort\\nof sighing animation which had a vast deal of the lover\\nshe was not less pleased another day with the manner\\nin which he seconded a sudden wish of hers to have harriets picture\\n\\ndid you ever have your likeness taken harriet said she did\\nyou ever sit for your picture\\n\\nharriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say\\nwith a very interesting naivete\\n\\noh dear no never\\n\\nno sooner was she out of sight than emma exclaimed\\n\\nwhat an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be i would\\ngive any money for it  i almost long to attempt her likeness myself\\nyou do not know it i dare say but two or three years ago i had\\na great passion for taking likenesses and attempted several of\\nmy friends and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general\\nbut from one cause or another i gave it up in disgust\\nbut really i could almost venture if harriet would sit to me\\nit would be such a delight to have her picture\\n\\nlet me entreat you cried mr elton it would indeed be a delight\\nlet me entreat you miss woodhouse to exercise so charming a\\ntalent in favour of your friend  i know what your drawings are\\nhow could you suppose me ignorant is not this room rich in\\nspecimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston\\nsome inimitable figurepieces in her drawingroom at randalls\\n\\nyes good manthought emmabut what has all that to do with taking\\nlikenesses you know nothing of drawing  dont pretend to be\\nin raptures about mine  keep your raptures for harriets face\\nwell if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe\\ni shall try what i can do  harriets features are very delicate\\nwhich makes a likeness difficult and yet there is a peculiarity\\nin the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought\\nto catch\\n\\nexactly sothe shape of the eye and the lines about the mouthi\\nhave not a doubt of your success  pray pray attempt it\\nas you will do it it will indeed to use your own words\\nbe an exquisite possession\\n\\nbut i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit\\nshe thinks so little of her own beauty  did not you observe her\\nmanner of answering me how completely it meant why should my\\npicture be drawn\\n\\noh yes i observed it i assure you  it was not lost on me\\nbut still i cannot imagine she would not be persuaded\\n\\nharriet was soon back again and the proposal almost immediately made\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest\\npressing of both the others  emma wished to go to work directly\\nand therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts\\nat portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they\\nmight decide together on the best size for harriet  her many\\nbeginnings were displayed  miniatures halflengths wholelengths\\npencil crayon and watercolours had been all tried in turn\\nshe had always wanted to do every thing and had made more progress\\nboth in drawing and music than many might have done with so little\\nlabour as she would ever submit to  she played and sangand drew\\nin almost every style but steadiness had always been wanting\\nand in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she\\nwould have been glad to command and ought not to have failed of\\nshe was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist\\nor a musician but she was not unwilling to have others deceived\\nor sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher\\nthan it deserved\\n\\nthere was merit in every drawingin the least finished perhaps the most\\nher style was spirited but had there been much less or had there\\nbeen ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions\\nwould have been the same  they were both in ecstasies  a likeness\\npleases every body and miss woodhouses performances must be capital\\n\\nno great variety of faces for you said emma  i had only my\\nown family to study from  there is my fatheranother of my\\nfatherbut the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous\\nthat i could only take him by stealth neither of them very\\nlike therefore  mrs weston again and again and again you see\\ndear mrs weston always my kindest friend on every occasion\\nshe would sit whenever i asked her  there is my sister and really\\nquite her own little elegant figureand the face not unlike\\ni should have made a good likeness of her if she would have\\nsat longer but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four\\nchildren that she would not be quiet  then here come all my\\nattempts at three of those four childrenthere they are\\nhenry and john and bella from one end of the sheet to the other\\nand any one of them might do for any one of the rest  she was so\\neager to have them drawn that i could not refuse but there is no\\nmaking children of three or four years old stand still you know\\nnor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them beyond the\\nair and complexion unless they are coarser featured than any\\nof mamas children ever were  here is my sketch of the fourth\\nwho was a baby  i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it\\nis as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see\\nhe had nestled down his head most conveniently  thats very like\\ni am rather proud of little george  the corner of the sofa is very good\\nthen here is my lastunclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\\nin small size wholelengthmy last and my bestmy brother\\nmr john knightleythis did not want much of being finished when i\\nput it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness\\ni could not help being provoked for after all my pains and when i\\nhad really made a very good likeness of itmrs weston and i\\nwere quite agreed in thinking it very likeonly too handsometoo\\nflatteringbut that was a fault on the right sideafter\\nall this came poor dear isabellas cold approbation ofyes\\nit was a little likebut to be sure it did not do him justice\\nwe had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all\\nit was made a great favour of and altogether it was more than i\\ncould bear and so i never would finish it to have it apologised\\nover as an unfavourable likeness to every morning visitor in\\nbrunswick squareand as i said i did then forswear ever drawing\\nany body again  but for harriets sake or rather for my own\\nand as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present\\ni will break my resolution now\\n\\nmr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea\\nand was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present\\nindeed as you observe  exactly so  no husbands and wives\\nwith so interesting a consciousness that emma began to consider\\nwhether she had not better leave them together at once  but as she\\nwanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer\\n\\nshe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait\\nit was to be a wholelength in watercolours like mr john\\nknightleys and was destined if she could please herself\\nto hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece\\n\\nthe sitting began and harriet smiling and blushing and afraid\\nof not keeping her attitude and countenance presented a very sweet\\nmixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist\\nbut there was no doing any thing with mr elton fidgeting behind\\nher and watching every touch  she gave him credit for stationing\\nhimself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence\\nbut was really obliged to put an end to it and request him to\\nplace himself elsewhere  it then occurred to her to employ him\\nin reading\\n\\nif he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness\\nindeed it would amuse away the difficulties of her part and lessen\\nthe irksomeness of miss smiths\\n\\nmr elton was only too happy  harriet listened and emma drew\\nin peace  she must allow him to be still frequently coming to look\\nany thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover\\nand he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil\\nto jump up and see the progress and be charmedthere was no\\nbeing displeased with such an encourager for his admiration\\nmade him discern a likeness almost before it was possible\\nshe could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance\\nwere unexceptionable\\n\\nthe sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite\\nenough pleased with the first days sketch to wish to go on\\nthere was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude\\nand as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure\\nto give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had\\ngreat confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last\\nand of its filling its destined place with credit to them botha\\nstanding memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other\\nand the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations\\nas mr eltons very promising attachment was likely to add\\n\\nharriet was to sit again the next day and mr elton just as he ought\\nentreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again\\n\\nby all means  we shall be most happy to consider you as one\\nof the party\\n\\nthe same civilities and courtesies the same success and satisfaction\\ntook place on the morrow and accompanied the whole progress\\nof the picture which was rapid and happy  every body who saw it\\nwas pleased but mr elton was in continual raptures and defended\\nit through every criticism\\n\\nmiss woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\\nwantedobserved mrs weston to himnot in the least suspecting\\nthat she was addressing a loverthe expression of the eye is\\nmost correct but miss smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes\\nit is the fault of her face that she has them not\\n\\ndo you think so replied he  i cannot agree with you\\nit appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature\\ni never saw such a likeness in my life  we must allow for the effect\\nof shade you know\\n\\nyou have made her too tall emma said mr knightley\\n\\nemma knew that she had but would not own it and mr elton warmly added\\n\\noh no certainly not too tall not in the least too tall  consider\\nshe is sitting downwhich naturally presents a differentwhich\\nin short gives exactly the ideaand the proportions must\\nbe preserved you know  proportions foreshorteningoh no it\\ngives one exactly the idea of such a height as miss smiths exactly so indeed\\n\\nit is very pretty said mr woodhouse  so prettily done just\\nas your drawings always are my dear  i do not know any body who draws\\nso well as you do  the only thing i do not thoroughly like is\\nthat she seems to be sitting out of doors with only a little shawl\\nover her shouldersand it makes one think she must catch cold\\n\\nbut my dear papa it is supposed to be summer a warm day in summer\\nlook at the tree\\n\\nbut it is never safe to sit out of doors my dear\\n\\nyou sir may say any thing cried mr elton but i must confess\\nthat i regard it as a most happy thought the placing of miss\\nsmith out of doors and the tree is touched with such inimitable\\nspirit any other situation would have been much less in character\\nthe naivete of miss smiths mannersand altogetheroh it is\\nmost admirable i cannot keep my eyes from it  i never saw such\\na likeness\\n\\nthe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed and here were a\\nfew difficulties  it must be done directly it must be done in london\\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\\ncould be depended on and isabella the usual doer of all commissions\\nmust not be applied to because it was december and mr woodhouse\\ncould not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs\\nof december  but no sooner was the distress known to mr elton\\nthan it was removed  his gallantry was always on the alert\\nmight he be trusted with the commission what infinite pleasure\\nshould he have in executing it he could ride to london at any time\\nit was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being\\nemployed on such an errand\\n\\nhe was too goodshe could not endure the thoughtshe would\\nnot give him such a troublesome office for the worldbrought\\non the desired repetition of entreaties and assurancesand\\na very few minutes settled the business\\n\\nmr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame\\nand give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it\\nas to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he\\nseemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough\\n\\nwhat a precious deposit said he with a tender sigh as he\\nreceived it\\n\\nthis man is almost too gallant to be in love thought emma\\ni should say so but that i suppose there may be a hundred different\\nways of being in love  he is an excellent young man and will suit\\nharriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself\\nbut he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more\\nthan i could endure as a principal  i come in for a pretty good\\nshare as a second  but it is his gratitude on harriets account\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii\\n\\n\\nthe very day of mr eltons going to london produced a fresh occasion\\nfor emmas services towards her friend  harriet had been at hartfield\\nas usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home\\nto return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been\\ntalked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something\\nextraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell\\nhalf a minute brought it all out  she had heard as soon as she got\\nback to mrs goddards that mr martin had been there an hour before\\nand finding she was not at home nor particularly expected had left\\na little parcel for her from one of his sisters and gone away\\nand on opening this parcel she had actually found besides the two\\nsongs which she had lent elizabeth to copy a letter to herself\\nand this letter was from him from mr martin and contained a direct\\nproposal of marriage  who could have thought it she was so surprized\\nshe did not know what to do  yes quite a proposal of marriage\\nand a very good letter at least she thought so  and he wrote\\nas if he really loved her very muchbut she did not knowand so\\nshe was come as fast as she could to ask miss woodhouse what she\\nshould do emma was halfashamed of her friend for seeming so\\npleased and so doubtful\\n\\nupon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose\\nany thing for want of asking  he will connect himself well if he can\\n\\nwill you read the letter cried harriet  pray do  id rather\\nyou would\\n\\nemma was not sorry to be pressed  she read and was surprized\\nthe style of the letter was much above her expectation\\nthere were not merely no grammatical errors but as a composition it\\nwould not have disgraced a gentleman the language though plain\\nwas strong and unaffected and the sentiments it conveyed very much\\nto the credit of the writer  it was short but expressed good sense\\nwarm attachment liberality propriety even delicacy of feeling\\nshe paused over it while harriet stood anxiously watching for\\nher opinion with a well well and was at last forced to add\\nis it a good letter or is it too short\\n\\nyes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowlyso\\ngood a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of\\nhis sisters must have helped him  i can hardly imagine the young\\nman whom i saw talking with you the other day could express himself\\nso well if left quite to his own powers and yet it is not the\\nstyle of a woman no certainly it is too strong and concise\\nnot diffuse enough for a woman  no doubt he is a sensible man\\nand i suppose may have a natural talent forthinks strongly and\\nclearlyand when he takes a pen in hand his thoughts naturally find\\nproper words  it is so with some men  yes i understand the sort\\nof mind  vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point\\nnot coarse  a better written letter harriet returning it\\nthan i had expected\\n\\nwell said the still waiting harrietwellandand what\\nshall i do\\n\\nwhat shall you do in what respect do you mean with regard\\nto this letter\\n\\nyes\\n\\nbut what are you in doubt of you must answer it of courseand speedily\\n\\nyes but what shall i say dear miss woodhouse do advise me\\n\\noh no no the letter had much better be all your own  you will\\nexpress yourself very properly i am sure  there is no danger of your\\nnot being intelligible which is the first thing  your meaning must\\nbe unequivocal no doubts or demurs and such expressions of gratitude\\nand concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires\\nwill present themselves unbidden to your mind i am persuaded\\nyou need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow\\nfor his disappointment\\n\\nyou think i ought to refuse him then said harriet looking down\\n\\nought to refuse him my dear harriet what do you mean are you\\nin any doubt as to that i thoughtbut i beg your pardon perhaps i\\nhave been under a mistake  i certainly have been misunderstanding\\nyou if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer\\ni had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it\\n\\nharriet was silent  with a little reserve of manner emma continued\\n\\nyou mean to return a favourable answer i collect\\n\\nno i do not that is i do not meanwhat shall i do what would\\nyou advise me to do pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i\\nought to do\\n\\ni shall not give you any advice harriet  i will have nothing to\\ndo with it  this is a point which you must settle with your feelings\\n\\ni had no notion that he liked me so very much said harriet\\ncontemplating the letter  for a little while emma persevered\\nin her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery\\nof that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say\\n\\ni lay it down as a general rule harriet that if a woman doubts\\nas to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought\\nto refuse him  if she can hesitate as to yes she ought to say\\nno directly  it is not a state to be safely entered into\\nwith doubtful feelings with half a heart  i thought it my duty\\nas a friend and older than yourself to say thus much to you\\nbut do not imagine that i want to influence you\\n\\noh no i am sure you are a great deal too kind tobut if you\\nwould just advise me what i had best dono no i do not mean\\nthatas you say ones mind ought to be quite made upone should\\nnot be hesitatingit is a very serious thingit will be safer\\nto say no perhapsdo you think i had better say no\\n\\nnot for the world said emma smiling graciously would i advise\\nyou either way  you must be the best judge of your own happiness\\nif you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him\\nthe most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should\\nyou hesitate you blush harrietdoes any body else occur to you\\nat this moment under such a definition harriet harriet do not\\ndeceive yourself do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion\\nat this moment whom are you thinking of\\n\\nthe symptoms were favourableinstead of answering harriet turned\\naway confused and stood thoughtfully by the fire and though\\nthe letter was still in her hand it was now mechanically twisted\\nabout without regard  emma waited the result with impatience\\nbut not without strong hopes  at last with some hesitation\\nharriet said\\n\\nmiss woodhouse as you will not give me your opinion i must\\ndo as well as i can by myself and i have now quite determined\\nand really almost made up my mindto refuse mr martin  do you\\nthink i am right\\n\\nperfectly perfectly right my dearest harriet you are doing just\\nwhat you ought  while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings\\nto myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no\\nhesitation in approving  dear harriet i give myself joy of this\\nit would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance which must have\\nbeen the consequence of your marrying mr martin  while you were in\\nthe smallest degree wavering i said nothing about it because i would\\nnot influence but it would have been the loss of a friend to me\\ni could not have visited mrs robert martin of abbeymill farm\\nnow i am secure of you for ever\\n\\nharriet had not surmised her own danger but the idea of it struck\\nher forcibly\\n\\nyou could not have visited me she cried looking aghast\\nno to be sure you could not but i never thought of that before\\nthat would have been too dreadfulwhat an escapedear miss woodhouse\\ni would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you\\nfor any thing in the world\\n\\nindeed harriet it would have been a severe pang to lose you\\nbut it must have been  you would have thrown yourself out of all\\ngood society  i must have given you up\\n\\ndear mehow should i ever have borne it it would have killed\\nme never to come to hartfield any more\\n\\ndear affectionate creatureyou banished to abbeymill farmyou\\nconfined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life\\ni wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it\\nhe must have a pretty good opinion of himself\\n\\ni do not think he is conceited either in general said harriet\\nher conscience opposing such censure at least he is very good natured\\nand i shall always feel much obliged to him and have a great regard\\nforbut that is quite a different thing fromand you know\\nthough he may like me it does not follow that i shouldand\\ncertainly i must confess that since my visiting here i have seen\\npeopleand if one comes to compare them person and manners\\nthere is no comparison at all one is so very handsome and agreeable\\nhowever i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man\\nand have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached\\nto meand his writing such a letterbut as to leaving you\\nit is what i would not do upon any consideration\\n\\nthank you thank you my own sweet little friend  we will not\\nbe parted  a woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked\\nor because he is attached to her and can write a tolerable letter\\n\\noh noand it is but a short letter too\\n\\nemma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a\\nvery true and it would be a small consolation to her for the\\nclownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day\\nto know that her husband could write a good letter\\n\\noh yes very  nobody cares for a letter the thing is to be always\\nhappy with pleasant companions  i am quite determined to refuse him\\nbut how shall i do what shall i say\\n\\nemma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer\\nand advised its being written directly which was agreed to\\nin the hope of her assistance and though emma continued to protest\\nagainst any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the\\nformation of every sentence  the looking over his letter again\\nin replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was\\nparticularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions\\nand she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy\\nand thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say\\nand was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful\\nthat emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment\\nhe would have been accepted after all\\n\\nthis letter however was written and sealed and sent\\nthe business was finished and harriet safe  she was rather low\\nall the evening but emma could allow for her amiable regrets\\nand sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection\\nsometimes by bringing forward the idea of mr elton\\n\\ni shall never be invited to abbeymill again was said in rather\\na sorrowful tone\\n\\nnor if you were could i ever bear to part with you my harriet\\nyou are a great deal too necessary at hartfield to be spared\\nto abbeymill\\n\\nand i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy\\nbut at hartfield\\n\\nsome time afterwards it was i think mrs goddard would be very\\nmuch surprized if she knew what had happened  i am sure miss nash\\nwouldfor miss nash thinks her own sister very well married\\nand it is only a linendraper\\n\\none should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the\\nteacher of a school harriet  i dare say miss nash would envy you\\nsuch an opportunity as this of being married  even this conquest\\nwould appear valuable in her eyes  as to any thing superior for you\\ni suppose she is quite in the dark  the attentions of a certain\\nperson can hardly be among the tittletattle of highbury yet\\nhitherto i fancy you and i are the only people to whom his looks\\nand manners have explained themselves\\n\\nharriet blushed and smiled and said something about wondering\\nthat people should like her so much  the idea of mr elton was\\ncertainly cheering but still after a time she was tenderhearted\\nagain towards the rejected mr martin\\n\\nnow he has got my letter said she softly  i wonder what they\\nare all doingwhether his sisters knowif he is unhappy\\nthey will be unhappy too  i hope he will not mind it so very much\\n\\nlet us think of those among our absent friends who are more\\ncheerfully employed cried emma  at this moment perhaps mr elton\\nis shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much\\nmore beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five\\nor six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name\\n\\nmy picturebut he has left my picture in bondstreet\\n\\nhas he sothen i know nothing of mr elton  no my dear\\nlittle modest harriet depend upon it the picture will not be\\nin bondstreet till just before he mounts his horse tomorrow\\nit is his companion all this evening his solace his delight\\nit opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them\\nit diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature\\neager curiosity and warm prepossession  how cheerful how animated\\nhow suspicious how busy their imaginations all are\\n\\nharriet smiled again and her smiles grew stronger\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii\\n\\n\\nharriet slept at hartfield that night  for some weeks past she\\nhad been spending more than half her time there and gradually\\ngetting to have a bedroom appropriated to herself and emma\\njudged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her\\nwith them as much as possible just at present  she was obliged\\nto go the next morning for an hour or two to mrs goddards\\nbut it was then to be settled that she should return to hartfield\\nto make a regular visit of some days\\n\\nwhile she was gone mr knightley called and sat some time with\\nmr woodhouse and emma till mr woodhouse who had previously made up\\nhis mind to walk out was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it\\nand was induced by the entreaties of both though against the scruples\\nof his own civility to leave mr knightley for that purpose\\nmr knightley who had nothing of ceremony about him was offering\\nby his short decided answers an amusing contrast to the protracted\\napologies and civil hesitations of the other\\n\\nwell i believe if you will excuse me mr knightley if you\\nwill not consider me as doing a very rude thing i shall take\\nemmas advice and go out for a quarter of an hour  as the sun\\nis out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can\\ni treat you without ceremony mr knightley  we invalids think we\\nare privileged people\\n\\nmy dear sir do not make a stranger of me\\n\\ni leave an excellent substitute in my daughter  emma will be happy\\nto entertain you  and therefore i think i will beg your excuse\\nand take my three turnsmy winter walk\\n\\nyou cannot do better sir\\n\\ni would ask for the pleasure of your company mr knightley\\nbut i am a very slow walker and my pace would be tedious to you\\nand besides you have another long walk before you to donwell abbey\\n\\nthank you sir thank you i am going this moment myself and i\\nthink the sooner you go the better  i will fetch your greatcoat\\nand open the garden door for you\\n\\nmr woodhouse at last was off but mr knightley instead of being\\nimmediately off likewise sat down again seemingly inclined\\nfor more chat  he began speaking of harriet and speaking\\nof her with more voluntary praise than emma had ever heard before\\n\\ni cannot rate her beauty as you do said he but she is a\\npretty little creature and i am inclined to think very well of\\nher disposition  her character depends upon those she is with\\nbut in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman\\n\\ni am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting\\n\\ncome said he you are anxious for a compliment so i will\\ntell you that you have improved her  you have cured her of her\\nschoolgirls giggle she really does you credit\\n\\nthank you  i should be mortified indeed if i did not believe i\\nhad been of some use but it is not every body who will bestow\\npraise where they may  you do not often overpower me with it\\n\\nyou are expecting her again you say this morning\\n\\nalmost every moment  she has been gone longer already than\\nshe intended\\n\\nsomething has happened to delay her some visitors perhaps\\n\\nhighbury gossipstiresome wretches\\n\\nharriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would\\n\\nemma knew this was too true for contradiction and therefore\\nsaid nothing  he presently added with a smile\\n\\ni do not pretend to fix on times or places but i must tell you\\nthat i have good reason to believe your little friend will soon\\nhear of something to her advantage\\n\\nindeed how so of what sort\\n\\na very serious sort i assure you still smiling\\n\\nvery serious i can think of but one thingwho is in love\\nwith her who makes you their confidant\\n\\nemma was more than half in hopes of mr eltons having dropt a hint\\nmr knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser and she knew\\nmr elton looked up to him\\n\\ni have reason to think he replied that harriet smith will\\nsoon have an offer of marriage and from a most unexceptionable\\nquarterrobert martin is the man  her visit to abbeymill\\nthis summer seems to have done his business  he is desperately\\nin love and means to marry her\\n\\nhe is very obliging said emma but is he sure that harriet\\nmeans to marry him\\n\\nwell well means to make her an offer then  will that do he came\\nto the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it\\nhe knows i have a thorough regard for him and all his family and\\ni believe considers me as one of his best friends  he came to ask\\nme whether i thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early\\nwhether i thought her too young in short whether i approved his\\nchoice altogether having some apprehension perhaps of her being\\nconsidered especially since your making so much of her as in a line\\nof society above him  i was very much pleased with all that he said\\ni never hear better sense from any one than robert martin\\nhe always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very\\nwell judging  he told me every thing his circumstances and plans\\nand what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage  he is\\nan excellent young man both as son and brother  i had no hesitation\\nin advising him to marry  he proved to me that he could afford it\\nand that being the case i was convinced he could not do better\\ni praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy\\nif he had never esteemed my opinion before he would have thought\\nhighly of me then and i dare say left the house thinking me the\\nbest friend and counsellor man ever had  this happened the night\\nbefore last  now as we may fairly suppose he would not allow\\nmuch time to pass before he spoke to the lady and as he does not\\nappear to have spoken yesterday it is not unlikely that he should\\nbe at mrs goddards today and she may be detained by a visitor\\nwithout thinking him at all a tiresome wretch\\n\\npray mr knightley said emma who had been smiling to herself\\nthrough a great part of this speech how do you know that mr martin\\ndid not speak yesterday\\n\\ncertainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it\\nbut it may be inferred  was not she the whole day with you\\n\\ncome said she i will tell you something in return for what\\nyou have told me  he did speak yesterdaythat is he wrote\\nand was refused\\n\\nthis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed\\nand mr knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure\\nas he stood up in tall indignation and said\\n\\nthen she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her\\nwhat is the foolish girl about\\n\\noh to be sure cried emma it is always incomprehensible\\nto a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage\\na man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her\\n\\nnonsense a man does not imagine any such thing  but what is\\nthe meaning of this harriet smith refuse robert martin madness\\nif it is so but i hope you are mistaken\\n\\ni saw her answernothing could be clearer\\n\\nyou saw her answeryou wrote her answer too  emma this is\\nyour doing  you persuaded her to refuse him\\n\\nand if i did which however i am far from allowing i should\\nnot feel that i had done wrong  mr martin is a very respectable\\nyoung man but i cannot admit him to be harriets equal and am\\nrather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her\\nby your account he does seem to have had some scruples  it is\\na pity that they were ever got over\\n\\nnot harriets equal exclaimed mr knightley loudly and warmly\\nand with calmer asperity added a few moments afterwards no he\\nis not her equal indeed for he is as much her superior in sense\\nas in situation  emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you\\nwhat are harriet smiths claims either of birth nature or education\\nto any connexion higher than robert martin she is the natural\\ndaughter of nobody knows whom with probably no settled provision\\nat all and certainly no respectable relations  she is known only\\nas parlourboarder at a common school  she is not a sensible girl\\nnor a girl of any information  she has been taught nothing useful\\nand is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself\\nat her age she can have no experience and with her little wit\\nis not very likely ever to have any that can avail her\\nshe is pretty and she is good tempered and that is all\\nmy only scruple in advising the match was on his account as being\\nbeneath his deserts and a bad connexion for him  i felt that\\nas to fortune in all probability he might do much better and that as\\nto a rational companion or useful helpmate he could not do worse\\nbut i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing\\nto trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort\\nof disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led\\naright and turn out very well  the advantage of the match i felt\\nto be all on her side and had not the smallest doubt nor have i now\\nthat there would be a general cryout upon her extreme good luck\\neven your satisfaction i made sure of  it crossed my mind immediately\\nthat you would not regret your friends leaving highbury for the\\nsake of her being settled so well  i remember saying to myself\\neven emma with all her partiality for harriet will think this a\\ngood match\\n\\ni cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say\\nany such thing  what think a farmer and with all his sense and all\\nhis merit mr martin is nothing more a good match for my intimate\\nfriend not regret her leaving highbury for the sake of marrying\\na man whom i could never admit as an acquaintance of my own i\\nwonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings\\ni assure you mine are very different  i must think your statement\\nby no means fair  you are not just to harriets claims\\nthey would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself\\nmr martin may be the richest of the two but he is undoubtedly\\nher inferior as to rank in societythe sphere in which she moves\\nis much above hisit would be a degradation\\n\\na degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance to be married\\nto a respectable intelligent gentlemanfarmer\\n\\nas to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense\\nshe may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense\\nshe is not to pay for the offence of others by being held below\\nthe level of those with whom she is brought upthere can scarcely\\nbe a doubt that her father is a gentlemanand a gentleman of\\nfortuneher allowance is very liberal nothing has ever been grudged\\nfor her improvement or comfortthat she is a gentlemans daughter\\nis indubitable to me that she associates with gentlemens daughters\\nno one i apprehend will denyshe is superior to mr robert martin\\n\\nwhoever might be her parents said mr knightley whoever may\\nhave had the charge of her it does not appear to have been any part\\nof their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society\\nafter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in\\nmrs goddards hands to shift as she canto move in short\\nin mrs goddards line to have mrs goddards acquaintance\\nher friends evidently thought this good enough for her and it was\\ngood enough  she desired nothing better herself  till you chose\\nto turn her into a friend her mind had no distaste for her own set\\nnor any ambition beyond it  she was as happy as possible with the\\nmartins in the summer  she had no sense of superiority then\\nif she has it now you have given it  you have been no friend to\\nharriet smith emma  robert martin would never have proceeded so far\\nif he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him\\ni know him well  he has too much real feeling to address any\\nwoman on the haphazard of selfish passion  and as to conceit\\nhe is the farthest from it of any man i know  depend upon it he\\nhad encouragement\\n\\nit was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this\\nassertion she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again\\n\\nyou are a very warm friend to mr martin but as i said before\\nare unjust to harriet  harriets claims to marry well are not\\nso contemptible as you represent them  she is not a clever girl\\nbut she has better sense than you are aware of and does not\\ndeserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly\\nwaiving that point however and supposing her to be as you\\ndescribe her only pretty and goodnatured let me tell you that in\\nthe degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations\\nto the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl\\nand must be thought so by ninetynine people out of an hundred\\nand till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject\\nof beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall\\nin love with wellinformed minds instead of handsome faces a girl\\nwith such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired\\nand sought after of having the power of chusing from among many\\nconsequently a claim to be nice  her goodnature too is not so very\\nslight a claim comprehending as it does real thorough sweetness\\nof temper and manner a very humble opinion of herself and a great\\nreadiness to be pleased with other people  i am very much mistaken\\nif your sex in general would not think such beauty and such temper\\nthe highest claims a woman could possess\\n\\nupon my word emma to hear you abusing the reason you have\\nis almost enough to make me think so too  better be without sense\\nthan misapply it as you do\\n\\nto be sure cried she playfully  i know that is the feeling\\nof you all  i know that such a girl as harriet is exactly\\nwhat every man delights inwhat at once bewitches his senses\\nand satisfies his judgment  oh harriet may pick and chuse\\nwere you yourself ever to marry she is the very woman for you\\nand is she at seventeen just entering into life just beginning\\nto be known to be wondered at because she does not accept the first\\noffer she receives nopray let her have time to look about her\\n\\ni have always thought it a very foolish intimacy said mr knightley\\npresently though i have kept my thoughts to myself but i now\\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for harriet\\nyou will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what\\nshe has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her\\nreach will be good enough for her  vanity working on a weak head\\nproduces every sort of mischief  nothing so easy as for a young lady\\nto raise her expectations too high  miss harriet smith may not find\\noffers of marriage flow in so fast though she is a very pretty girl\\nmen of sense whatever you may chuse to say do not want silly wives\\nmen of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves\\nwith a girl of such obscurityand most prudent men would be\\nafraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in\\nwhen the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed  let her marry\\nrobert martin and she is safe respectable and happy for ever\\nbut if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly and teach\\nher to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence\\nand large fortune she may be a parlourboarder at mrs goddards\\nall the rest of her lifeor at least for harriet smith is a\\ngirl who will marry somebody or other till she grow desperate\\nand is glad to catch at the old writingmasters son\\n\\nwe think so very differently on this point mr knightley\\nthat there can be no use in canvassing it  we shall only be making\\neach other more angry  but as to my letting her marry robert martin\\nit is impossible she has refused him and so decidedly i think\\nas must prevent any second application  she must abide by the evil\\nof having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself\\ni will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little\\nbut i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do\\nhis appearance is so much against him and his manner so bad\\nthat if she ever were disposed to favour him she is not now\\ni can imagine that before she had seen any body superior\\nshe might tolerate him  he was the brother of her friends\\nand he took pains to please her and altogether having seen\\nnobody better that must have been his great assistant\\nshe might not while she was at abbeymill find him disagreeable\\nbut the case is altered now  she knows now what gentlemen are\\nand nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance\\nwith harriet\\n\\nnonsense errant nonsense as ever was talked cried mr knightleyrobert\\nmartins manners have sense sincerity and goodhumour to recommend\\nthem and his mind has more true gentility than harriet smith could understand\\n\\nemma made no answer and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned but was\\nreally feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone\\nshe did not repent what she had done she still thought herself\\na better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he\\ncould be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment\\nin general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her\\nand to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state\\nwas very disagreeable  some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence\\nwith only one attempt on emmas side to talk of the weather\\nbut he made no answer  he was thinking  the result of his thoughts\\nappeared at last in these words\\n\\nrobert martin has no great lossif he can but think so and i\\nhope it will not be long before he does  your views for harriet\\nare best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love\\nof matchmaking it is fair to suppose that views and plans\\nand projects you haveand as a friend i shall just hint to you\\nthat if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain\\n\\nemma laughed and disclaimed  he continued\\n\\ndepend upon it elton will not do  elton is a very good sort of man\\nand a very respectable vicar of highbury but not at all likely\\nto make an imprudent match  he knows the value of a good income\\nas well as any body  elton may talk sentimentally but he will\\nact rationally  he is as well acquainted with his own claims as you\\ncan be with harriets he knows that he is a very handsome young man\\nand a great favourite wherever he goes and from his general way\\nof talking in unreserved moments when there are only men present\\ni am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away\\ni have heard him speak with great animation of a large family\\nof young ladies that his sisters are intimate with who have all\\ntwenty thousand pounds apiece\\n\\ni am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again\\nif i had set my heart on mr eltons marrying harriet it would\\nhave been very kind to open my eyes but at present i only want\\nto keep harriet to myself  i have done with matchmaking indeed\\ni could never hope to equal my own doings at randalls  i shall leave\\noff while i am well\\n\\ngood morning to yousaid he rising and walking off abruptly\\nhe was very much vexed  he felt the disappointment of the young man\\nand was mortified to have been the means of promoting it by the\\nsanction he had given and the part which he was persuaded emma had\\ntaken in the affair was provoking him exceedingly\\n\\nemma remained in a state of vexation too but there was more\\nindistinctness in the causes of hers than in his  she did not always\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself so entirely convinced that\\nher opinions were right and her adversarys wrong as mr knightley\\nhe walked off in more complete selfapprobation than he left for her\\nshe was not so materially cast down however but that a little\\ntime and the return of harriet were very adequate restoratives\\nharriets staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy\\nthe possibility of the young mans coming to mrs goddards\\nthat morning and meeting with harriet and pleading his own cause\\ngave alarming ideas  the dread of such a failure after all became the\\nprominent uneasiness and when harriet appeared and in very good spirits\\nand without having any such reason to give for her long absence\\nshe felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind\\nand convinced her that let mr knightley think or say what he would\\nshe had done nothing which womans friendship and womans feelings\\nwould not justify\\n\\nhe had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered\\nthat mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done\\nneither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself\\nin spite of mr knightleys pretensions with the skill of such\\nan observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it\\nhastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather\\nsaid what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew\\nany thing about  he certainly might have heard mr elton speak\\nwith more unreserve than she had ever done and mr elton might not\\nbe of an imprudent inconsiderate disposition as to money matters\\nhe might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them\\nbut then mr knightley did not make due allowance for the influence\\nof a strong passion at war with all interested motives  mr knightley\\nsaw no such passion and of course thought nothing of its effects\\nbut she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any\\nhesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest\\nand more than a reasonable becoming degree of prudence she was very\\nsure did not belong to mr elton\\n\\nharriets cheerful look and manner established hers she came back\\nnot to think of mr martin but to talk of mr elton  miss nash\\nhad been telling her something which she repeated immediately\\nwith great delight  mr perry had been to mrs goddards to attend\\na sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash\\nthat as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met\\nmr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was\\nactually on his road to london and not meaning to return till\\nthe morrow though it was the whistclub night which he had been\\nnever known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him\\nabout it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player\\nto absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off\\nhis journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been\\ndetermined to go on and had said in a very particular way indeed\\nthat he was going on business which he would not put off for any\\ninducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission\\nand being the bearer of something exceedingly precious  mr perry\\ncould not quite understand him but he was very sure there must\\nbe a lady in the case and he told him so and mr elton only\\nlooked very conscious and smiling and rode off in great spirits\\nmiss nash had told her all this and had talked a great deal more\\nabout mr elton and said looking so very significantly at her\\nthat she did not pretend to understand what his business might be\\nbut she only knew that any woman whom mr elton could prefer\\nshe should think the luckiest woman in the world for beyond a doubt\\nmr elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix\\n\\n\\nmr knightley might quarrel with her but emma could not quarrel\\nwith herself  he was so much displeased that it was longer than\\nusual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet\\nhis grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven  she was sorry\\nbut could not repent  on the contrary her plans and proceedings\\nwere more and more justified and endeared to her by the general\\nappearances of the next few days\\n\\nthe picture elegantly framed came safely to hand soon after\\nmr eltons return and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\\nsittingroom he got up to look at it and sighed out his half sentences\\nof admiration just as he ought and as for harriets feelings they were\\nvisibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment\\nas her youth and sort of mind admitted  emma was soon perfectly\\nsatisfied of mr martins being no otherwise remembered than as\\nhe furnished a contrast with mr elton of the utmost advantage to the latter\\n\\nher views of improving her little friends mind by a great deal\\nof useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than\\na few first chapters and the intention of going on tomorrow\\nit was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let\\nher imagination range and work at harriets fortune than to be\\nlabouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts\\nand the only literary pursuit which engaged harriet at present\\nthe only mental provision she was making for the evening of life\\nwas the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort\\nthat she could meet with into a thin quarto of hotpressed paper\\nmade up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies\\n\\nin this age of literature such collections on a very grand scale\\nare not uncommon  miss nash headteacher at mrs goddards\\nhad written out at least three hundred and harriet who had taken\\nthe first hint of it from her hoped with miss woodhouses help\\nto get a great many more  emma assisted with her invention\\nmemory and taste and as harriet wrote a very pretty hand\\nit was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form\\nas well as quantity\\n\\nmr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls\\nand tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in\\nso many clever riddles as there used to be when he was younghe\\nwondered he could not remember them but he hoped he should in time\\nand it always ended in kitty a fair but frozen maid\\n\\nhis good friend perry too whom he had spoken to on the subject\\ndid not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind\\nbut he had desired perry to be upon the watch and as he went about\\nso much something he thought might come from that quarter\\n\\nit was by no means his daughters wish that the intellects of\\nhighbury in general should be put under requisition  mr elton\\nwas the only one whose assistance she asked  he was invited\\nto contribute any really good enigmas charades or conundrums\\nthat he might recollect and she had the pleasure of seeing him\\nmost intently at work with his recollections and at the same time\\nas she could perceive most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant\\nnothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass\\nhis lips  they owed to him their two or three politest puzzles\\nand the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled\\nand rather sentimentally recited that wellknown charade\\n\\n    my first doth affliction denote\\n      which my second is destind to feel\\n    and my whole is the best antidote\\n      that affliction to soften and heal\\n\\nmade her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it\\nsome pages ago already\\n\\nwhy will not you write one yourself for us mr elton said she\\nthat is the only security for its freshness and nothing could be\\neasier to you\\n\\noh no he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind\\nin his life  the stupidest fellow he was afraid not even miss\\nwoodhousehe stopt a momentor miss smith could inspire him\\n\\nthe very next day however produced some proof of inspiration\\nhe called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the\\ntable containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had\\naddressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which\\nfrom his manner emma was immediately convinced must be his own\\n\\ni do not offer it for miss smiths collection said he\\nbeing my friends i have no right to expose it in any degree\\nto the public eye but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it\\n\\nthe speech was more to emma than to harriet which emma\\ncould understand  there was deep consciousness about him\\nand he found it easier to meet her eye than her friends\\nhe was gone the next momentafter another moments pause\\n\\ntake it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards\\nharrietit is for you  take your own\\n\\nbut harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and

break off from these very pleasant observations\\nwhich were otherwise of a sort to run into great length by the\\neagerness of harriets wondering questions\\n\\nwhat can it be miss woodhousewhat can

inquiry of well my dears\\nhow does your book go onhave you got any thing fresh\\n\\nyes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh\\na piece of paper was found on the table this morningdropt\\nwe suppose by a fairycontaining a very pretty charade and we\\nhave just copied it in\\n\\nshe read it to him just as he liked to have any thing read\\nslowly and distinctly and two or three times over with explanations\\nof every part as she proceededand he was very much pleased and\\nas she had foreseen especially struck with the complimentary conclusion\\n\\naye thats very just indeed thats very properly said\\nvery true  woman lovely woman it is such a pretty charade\\nmy dear that i can easily guess what fairy brought itnobody\\ncould have written so prettily but you emma\\n\\nemma only nodded and smiledafter a little thinking\\nand a very tender sigh he added\\n\\nah it is no difficulty to see who you take after your dear mother\\nwas so clever at all those things if i had but her memory but i\\ncan remember nothingnot even that particular riddle which you\\nhave heard me mention i can only recollect the first stanza\\nand there are several\\n\\n    kitty a fair but frozen maid\\n      kindled a flame i yet deplore\\n    the hoodwinkd boy i called to aid\\n    though of his near approach afraid\\n      so fatal to my suit before\\n\\nand that is all that i can recollect of itbut it is very clever\\nall the way through  but i think my dear you said you had got it\\n\\nyes papa it is written out in our second page  we copied it\\nfrom the elegant extracts  it was garricks you know\\n\\naye very truei wish i could recollect more of it\\n\\n    kitty a fair but frozen maid\\n\\nthe name makes me think of poor isabella for she was very near\\nbeing christened catherine after her grandmama  i hope we shall\\nhave her here next week  have you thought my dear where you\\nshall put herand what room there will be for the children\\n\\noh yesshe will have her own room of course the room she always\\nhasand there is the nursery for the childrenjust as usual\\nyou know  why should there be any change\\n\\ni do not know my dearbut it is so long since she was herenot\\nsince last easter and then only for a few daysmr john knightleys\\nbeing a lawyer is very inconvenientpoor isabellashe is sadly\\ntaken away from us alland how sorry she will be when she comes\\nnot to see miss taylor here\\n\\nshe will not be surprized papa at least\\n\\ni do not know my dear  i am sure i was very much surprized\\nwhen i first heard she was going to be married\\n\\nwe must ask mr and mrs weston to dine with us while isabella\\nis here\\n\\nyes my dear if there is timebutin a very depressed toneshe\\nis coming for only one week  there will not be time for any thing\\n\\nit is unfortunate that they cannot stay longerbut it seems a case\\nof necessity  mr john knightley must be in town again on the 28th\\nand we ought to be thankful papa that we are to have the whole\\nof the time they can give to the country that two or three days\\nare not to be taken out for the abbey  mr knightley promises\\nto give up his claim this christmasthough you know it is longer\\nsince they were with him than with us\\n\\nit would be very hard indeed my dear if poor isabella were\\nto be anywhere but at hartfield\\n\\nmr woodhouse could never allow for mr knightleys claims on\\nhis brother or any bodys claims on isabella except his own\\nhe sat musing a little while and then said\\n\\nbut i do not see why poor isabella should be obliged to go back\\nso soon though he does  i think emma i shall try and persuade\\nher to stay longer with us  she and the children might stay very well\\n\\nah papathat is what you never have been able to accomplish\\nand i do not think you ever will  isabella cannot bear to stay\\nbehind her husband\\n\\nthis was too true for contradiction  unwelcome as it was mr woodhouse\\ncould only give a submissive sigh and as emma saw his spirits\\naffected by the idea of his daughters attachment to her husband\\nshe immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them\\n\\nharriet must give us as much of her company as she can while\\nmy brother and sister are here  i am sure she will be pleased\\nwith the children  we are very proud of the children are not we\\npapa i wonder which she will think the handsomest henry or john\\n\\naye i wonder which she will  poor little dears how glad they\\nwill be to come  they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet\\n\\ni dare say they are sir  i am sure i do not know who is not\\n\\nhenry is a fine boy but john is very like his mama  henry is the eldest\\nhe was named after me not after his father  john the second\\nis named after his father  some people are surprized i believe\\nthat the eldest was not but isabella would have him called henry\\nwhich i thought very pretty of her  and he is a very clever boy\\nindeed  they are all remarkably clever and they have so many\\npretty ways  they will come and stand by my chair and say\\ngrandpapa can you give me a bit of string and once henry asked me\\nfor a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas\\ni think their father is too rough with them very often\\n\\nhe appears rough to you said emma because you are so very\\ngentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas\\nyou would not think him rough  he wishes his boys to be active and hardy\\nand if they misbehave can give them a sharp word now and then\\nbut he is an affectionate fathercertainly mr john knightley\\nis an affectionate father  the children are all fond of him\\n\\nand then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling\\nin a very frightful way\\n\\nbut they like it papa there is nothing they like so much\\nit is such enjoyment to them that if their uncle did not lay down\\nthe rule of their taking turns whichever began would never give way\\nto the other\\n\\nwell i cannot understand it\\n\\nthat is the case with us all papa  one half of the world cannot\\nunderstand the pleasures of the other\\n\\nlater in the morning and just as the girls were going to separate\\nin preparation for the regular four oclock dinner the hero\\nof this inimitable charade walked in again  harriet turned away\\nbut emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye\\nsoon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a pushof\\nhaving thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it\\nmight turn up  his ostensible reason however was to ask whether\\nmr woodhouses party could be made up in the evening without him\\nor whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at hartfield\\nif he were every thing else must give way but otherwise his friend\\ncole had been saying so much about his dining with himhad made\\nsuch a point of it that he had promised him conditionally to come\\n\\nemma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his\\nfriend on their account her father was sure of his rubber\\nhe reurgedshe redeclined and he seemed then about to make\\nhis bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it\\n\\noh here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us\\nthank you for the sight of it  we admired it so much that i have\\nventured to write it into miss smiths collection  your friend\\nwill not take it amiss i hope  of course i have not transcribed\\nbeyond the first eight lines\\n\\nmr elton certainly did not very well know what to say\\nhe looked rather doubtinglyrather confused said something about\\nhonourglanced at emma and at harriet and then seeing the book\\nopen on the table took it up and examined it very attentively\\nwith the view of passing off an awkward moment emma smilingly said\\n\\nyou must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade\\nmust not be confined to one or two  he may be sure of every womans\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry\\n\\ni have no hesitation in saying replied mr elton though hesitating\\na good deal while he spoke i have no hesitation in sayingat\\nleast if my friend feels at all as i doi have not the smallest\\ndoubt that could he see his little effusion honoured as i see it\\nlooking at the book again and replacing it on the table he\\nwould consider it as the proudest moment of his life\\n\\nafter this speech he was gone as soon as possible  emma could not\\nthink it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities\\nthere was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt\\nto incline her to laugh  she ran away to indulge the inclination\\nleaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriets share\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x\\n\\n\\nthough now the middle of december there had yet been no weather\\nto prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise\\nand on the morrow emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor\\nsick family who lived a little way out of highbury\\n\\ntheir road to this detached cottage was down vicarage lane a lane\\nleading at right angles from the broad though irregular main street\\nof the place and as may be inferred containing the blessed abode\\nof mr elton  a few inferior dwellings were first to be passed\\nand then about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the vicarage\\nan old and not very good house almost as close to the road as it\\ncould be  it had no advantage of situation but had been very much\\nsmartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was\\nthere could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without\\na slackened pace and observing eyesemmas remark was\\n\\nthere it is  there go you and your riddlebook one of these days\\nharriets was\\n\\noh what a sweet househow very beautifulthere are the yellow\\ncurtains that miss nash admires so much\\n\\ni do not often walk this way now said emma as they proceeded\\nbut then there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get\\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards\\nof this part of highbury\\n\\nharriet she found had never in her life been within side the vicarage\\nand her curiosity to see it was so extreme that considering exteriors\\nand probabilities emma could only class it as a proof of love\\nwith mr eltons seeing ready wit in her\\n\\ni wish we could contrive it said she but i cannot think\\nof any tolerable pretence for going inno servant that i want\\nto inquire about of his housekeeperno message from my father\\n\\nshe pondered but could think of nothing  after a mutual silence\\nof some minutes harriet thus began again\\n\\ni do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married\\nor going to be married so charming as you are\\n\\nemma laughed and replied\\n\\nmy being charming harriet is not quite enough to induce me to marry\\ni must find other people charmingone other person at least\\nand i am not only not going to be married at present but have\\nvery little intention of ever marrying at all\\n\\nahso you say but i cannot believe it\\n\\ni must see somebody very superior to any one i have seen yet\\nto be tempted mr elton you know recollecting herself\\nis out of the question  and i do not wish to see any such person\\ni would rather not be tempted  i cannot really change for the better\\nif i were to marry i must expect to repent it\\n\\ndear meit is so odd to hear a woman talk so\\n\\ni have none of the usual inducements of women to marry\\nwere i to fall in love indeed it would be a different thing\\nbut i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature\\nand i do not think i ever shall  and without love i am sure i\\nshould be a fool to change such a situation as mine  fortune i\\ndo not want employment i do not want consequence i do not want\\ni believe few married women are half as much mistress of their\\nhusbands house as i am of hartfield and never never could i expect\\nto be so truly beloved and important so always first and always\\nright in any mans eyes as i am in my fathers\\n\\nbut then to be an old maid at last like miss bates\\n\\nthat is as formidable an image as you could present harriet and if i\\nthought i should ever be like miss bates so sillyso satisfied\\nso smilingso prosingso undistinguishing and unfastidious\\nand so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me\\ni would marry tomorrow but between us i am convinced there never\\ncan be any likeness except in being unmarried\\n\\nbut still you will be an old maid and thats so dreadful\\n\\nnever mind harriet i shall not be a poor old maid and it is\\npoverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public\\na single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous\\ndisagreeable old maid the proper sport of boys and girls\\nbut a single woman of good fortune is always respectable\\nand may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else  and the\\ndistinction is not quite so much against the candour and common\\nsense of the world as appears at first for a very narrow income\\nhas a tendency to contract the mind and sour the temper\\nthose who can barely live and who live perforce in a very small\\nand generally very inferior society may well be illiberal and cross\\nthis does not apply however to miss bates she is only too good\\nnatured and too silly to suit me but in general she is very\\nmuch to the taste of every body though single and though poor\\npoverty certainly has not contracted her mind  i really believe\\nif she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely\\nto give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her  that is a\\ngreat charm\\n\\ndear me but what shall you do how shall you employ yourself\\nwhen you grow old\\n\\nif i know myself harriet mine is an active busy mind with a great\\nmany independent resources and i do not perceive why i should be\\nmore in want of employment at forty or fifty than oneandtwenty\\nwomans usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then\\nas they are now or with no important variation  if i draw less\\ni shall read more if i give up music i shall take to carpetwork\\nand as for objects of interest objects for the affections\\nwhich is in truth the great point of inferiority the want of which\\nis really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying i shall\\nbe very well off with all the children of a sister i love so much\\nto care about  there will be enough of them in all probability\\nto supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need\\nthere will be enough for every hope and every fear and though my\\nattachment to none can equal that of a parent it suits my ideas\\nof comfort better than what is warmer and blinder  my nephews\\nand niecesi shall often have a niece with me\\n\\ndo you know miss batess niece  that is i know you must have\\nseen her a hundred timesbut are you acquainted\\n\\noh yes we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes\\nto highbury  by the bye that is almost enough to put one out\\nof conceit with a niece  heaven forbid at least that i should\\never bore people half so much about all the knightleys together\\nas she does about jane fairfax  one is sick of the very name\\nof jane fairfax  every letter from her is read forty times over\\nher compliments to all friends go round and round again and if she\\ndoes but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher or knit a pair\\nof garters for her grandmother one hears of nothing else for a month\\ni wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death\\n\\nthey were now approaching the cottage and all idle topics\\nwere superseded  emma was very compassionate and the distresses\\nof the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention\\nand kindness her counsel and her patience as from her purse\\nshe understood their ways could allow for their ignorance and\\ntheir temptations had no romantic expectations of extraordinary\\nvirtue from those for whom education had done so little entered into\\ntheir troubles with ready sympathy and always gave her assistance\\nwith as much intelligence as goodwill  in the present instance\\nit was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit\\nand after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice\\nshe quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene\\nas made her say to harriet as they walked away\\n\\nthese are the sights harriet to do one good  how trifling they\\nmake every thing else appeari feel now as if i could think of\\nnothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day and yet\\nwho can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind\\n\\nvery true said harriet  poor creatures one can think\\nof nothing else\\n\\nand really i do not think the impression will soon be over\\nsaid emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep\\nwhich ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden\\nand brought them into the lane again  i do not think it will\\nstopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place\\nand recall the still greater within\\n\\noh dear no said her companion\\n\\nthey walked on  the lane made a slight bend and when that bend\\nwas passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near\\nas to give emma time only to say farther\\n\\nah  harriet here comes a very sudden trial of our stability\\nin good thoughts  well smiling i hope it may be allowed that\\nif compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers\\nit has done all that is truly important  if we feel for the wretched\\nenough to do all we can for them the rest is empty sympathy\\nonly distressing to ourselves\\n\\nharriet could just answer oh dear yes before the gentleman\\njoined them  the wants and sufferings of the poor family however\\nwere the first subject on meeting  he had been going to call\\non them  his visit he would now defer but they had a very\\ninteresting parley about what could be done and should be done\\nmr elton then turned back to accompany them\\n\\nto fall in with each other on such an errand as this thought emma\\nto meet in a charitable scheme this will bring a great increase\\nof love on each side  i should not wonder if it were to bring\\non the declaration  it must if i were not here  i wish i were\\nanywhere else\\n\\nanxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised\\non one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road\\nbut she had not been there two minutes when she found that harriets\\nhabits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too and that\\nin short they would both be soon after her  this would not do\\nshe immediately stopped under pretence of having some alteration\\nto make in the lacing of her halfboot and stooping down in complete\\noccupation of the footpath begged them to have the goodness to walk on\\nand she would follow in half a minute  they did as they were desired\\nand by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot\\nshe had the comfort of farther delay in her power being overtaken\\nby a child from the cottage setting out according to orders\\nwith her pitcher to fetch broth from hartfield  to walk by the side\\nof this child and talk to and question her was the most natural\\nthing in the world or would have been the most natural had she been\\nacting just then without design and by this means the others were\\nstill able to keep ahead without any obligation of waiting for her\\nshe gained on them however involuntarily  the childs pace was quick\\nand theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it\\nfrom their being evidently in a conversation which interested them\\nmr elton was speaking with animation harriet listening with a very\\npleased attention and emma having sent the child on was beginning\\nto think how she might draw back a little more when they both\\nlooked around and she was obliged to join them\\n\\nmr elton was still talking still engaged in some interesting detail\\nand emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he\\nwas only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterdays\\nparty at his friend coles and that she was come in herself for\\nthe stilton cheese the north wiltshire the butter the cellery\\nthe beetroot and all the dessert\\n\\nthis would soon have led to something better of course was her\\nconsoling reflection any thing interests between those who love\\nand any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart\\nif i could but have kept longer away\\n\\nthey now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage\\npales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into\\nthe house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot\\nand fall behind to arrange it once more  she then broke the lace\\noff short and dexterously throwing it into a ditch was presently\\nobliged to entreat them to stop and acknowledged her inability to\\nput herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort\\n\\npart of my lace is gone said she and i do not know how i am\\nto contrive  i really am a most troublesome companion to you both\\nbut i hope i am not often so illequipped mr elton i must beg\\nleave to stop at your house and ask your housekeeper for a bit\\nof ribband or string or any thing just to keep my boot on\\n\\nmr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing\\ncould exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into\\nhis house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage\\nthe room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied\\nand looking forwards behind it was another with which it immediately\\ncommunicated the door between them was open and emma passed\\ninto it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most\\ncomfortable manner  she was obliged to leave the door ajar as she\\nfound it but she fully intended that mr elton should close it\\nit was not closed however it still remained ajar but by engaging\\nthe housekeeper in incessant conversation she hoped to make it\\npracticable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room\\nfor ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself  it could\\nbe protracted no longer  she was then obliged to be finished\\nand make her appearance\\n\\nthe lovers were standing together at one of the windows  it had a\\nmost favourable aspect and for half a minute emma felt the glory\\nof having schemed successfully  but it would not do he had not\\ncome to the point  he had been most agreeable most delightful\\nhe had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely\\nfollowed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt\\nbut nothing serious\\n\\ncautious very cautious thought emma he advances inch by inch\\nand will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure\\n\\nstill however though every thing had not been accomplished\\nby her ingenious device she could not but flatter herself\\nthat it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both\\nand must be leading them forward to the great event\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi\\n\\n\\nmr elton must now be left to himself  it was no longer in emmas\\npower to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures\\nthe coming of her sisters family was so very near at hand\\nthat first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth\\nher prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay\\nat hartfield it was not to be expectedshe did not herself expect\\nthat any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could\\nbe afforded by her to the lovers  they might advance rapidly\\nif they would however they must advance somehow or other whether\\nthey would or no  she hardly wished to have more leisure for them\\nthere are people who the more you do for them the less they will\\ndo for themselves\\n\\nmr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual\\nabsent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the\\nusual interest  till this year every long vacation since their\\nmarriage had been divided between hartfield and donwell abbey\\nbut all the holidays of this autumn had been given to seabathing\\nfor the children and it was therefore many months since they had\\nbeen seen in a regular way by their surry connexions or seen at all\\nby mr woodhouse who could not be induced to get so far as london\\neven for poor isabellas sake and who consequently was now most\\nnervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit\\n\\nhe thought much of the evils of the journey for her and not a\\nlittle of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to\\nbring some of the party the last half of the way but his alarms\\nwere needless the sixteen miles being happily accomplished\\nand mr and mrs john knightley their five children and a competent\\nnumber of nurserymaids all reaching hartfield in safety\\nthe bustle and joy of such an arrival the many to be talked to\\nwelcomed encouraged and variously dispersed and disposed of\\nproduced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne\\nunder any other cause nor have endured much longer even for this\\nbut the ways of hartfield and the feelings of her father were\\nso respected by mrs john knightley that in spite of maternal\\nsolicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones\\nand for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance\\nall the eating and drinking and sleeping and playing\\nwhich they could possibly wish for without the smallest delay\\nthe children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him\\neither in themselves or in any restless attendance on them\\n\\nmrs john knightley was a pretty elegant little woman of gentle\\nquiet manners and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate\\nwrapt up in her family a devoted wife a doating mother\\nand so tenderly attached to her father and sister that but for\\nthese higher ties a warmer love might have seemed impossible\\nshe could never see a fault in any of them  she was not a woman\\nof strong understanding or any quickness and with this resemblance\\nof her father she inherited also much of his constitution\\nwas delicate in her own health overcareful of that of her children\\nhad many fears and many nerves and was as fond of her own mr wingfield\\nin town as her father could be of mr perry  they were alike too\\nin a general benevolence of temper and a strong habit of regard\\nfor every old acquaintance\\n\\nmr john knightley was a tall gentlemanlike and very clever man\\nrising in his profession domestic and respectable in his\\nprivate character but with reserved manners which prevented his being\\ngenerally pleasing and capable of being sometimes out of humour\\nhe was not an illtempered man not so often unreasonably cross\\nas to deserve such a reproach but his temper was not his\\ngreat perfection and indeed with such a worshipping wife\\nit was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not\\nbe increased  the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his\\nhe had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted\\nand he could sometimes act an ungracious or say a severe thing\\n\\nhe was not a great favourite with his fair sisterinlaw nothing\\nwrong in him escaped her  she was quick in feeling the little\\ninjuries to isabella which isabella never felt herself\\nperhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been\\nflattering to isabellas sister but they were only those of a calmly\\nkind brother and friend without praise and without blindness\\nbut hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her\\nregardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes\\nfell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father\\nthere he had not always the patience that could have been wished\\nmr woodhouses peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking\\nhim to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally illbestowed\\nit did not often happen for mr john knightley had really a great\\nregard for his fatherinlaw and generally a strong sense of what was\\ndue to him but it was too often for emmas charity especially as\\nthere was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured\\nthough the offence came not  the beginning however of every visit\\ndisplayed none but the properest feelings and this being of necessity\\nso short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality\\nthey had not been long seated and composed when mr woodhouse\\nwith a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughters\\nattention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last\\n\\nah my dear said he poor miss taylorit is a grievous business\\n\\noh yes sir cried she with ready sympathy how you must\\nmiss her  and dear emma toowhat a dreadful loss to you both\\ni have been so grieved for youi could not imagine how you could\\npossibly do without herit is a sad change indeedbut i hope\\nshe is pretty well sir\\n\\npretty well my deari hopepretty welli do not know\\nbut that the place agrees with her tolerably\\n\\nmr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any\\ndoubts of the air of randalls\\n\\noh nonone in the least  i never saw mrs weston better in my life\\nnever looking so well  papa is only speaking his own regret\\n\\nvery much to the honour of both was the handsome reply\\n\\nand do you see her sir tolerably often asked isabella\\nin the plaintive tone which just suited her father\\n\\nmr woodhouse hesitatednot near so often my dear as i could wish\\n\\noh papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since\\nthey married  either in the morning or evening of every day\\nexcepting one have we seen either mr weston or mrs weston\\nand generally both either at randalls or hereand as you\\nmay suppose isabella most frequently here  they are very\\nvery kind in their visits  mr weston is really as kind as herself\\npapa if you speak in that melancholy way you will be giving\\nisabella a false idea of us all  every body must be aware that miss\\ntaylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured\\nthat mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any\\nmeans to the extent we ourselves anticipatedwhich is the exact truth\\n\\njust as it should be said mr john knightley and just as i hoped\\nit was from your letters  her wish of shewing you attention could\\nnot be doubted and his being a disengaged and social man makes it\\nall easy  i have been always telling you my love that i had no idea\\nof the change being so very material to hartfield as you apprehended\\nand now you have emmas account i hope you will be satisfied\\n\\nwhy to be sure said mr woodhouseyes certainlyi cannot deny\\nthat mrs weston poor mrs weston does come and see us pretty often\\nbut thenshe is always obliged to go away again\\n\\nit would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa\\nyou quite forget poor mr weston\\n\\ni think indeed said john knightley pleasantly that mr weston\\nhas some little claim  you and i emma will venture to take the part\\nof the poor husband  i being a husband and you not being a wife\\nthe claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force\\nas for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience\\nof putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can\\n\\nme my love cried his wife hearing and understanding only in part\\nare you talking about mei am sure nobody ought to be or can be\\na greater advocate for matrimony than i am and if it had not been\\nfor the misery of her leaving hartfield i should never have thought\\nof miss taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world\\nand as to slighting mr weston that excellent mr weston i think\\nthere is nothing he does not deserve  i believe he is one of the\\nvery besttempered men that ever existed  excepting yourself\\nand your brother i do not know his equal for temper  i shall\\nnever forget his flying henrys kite for him that very windy day\\nlast easterand ever since his particular kindness last september\\ntwelvemonth in writing that note at twelve oclock at night\\non purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at cobham\\ni have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor\\na better man in existenceif any body can deserve him it must be\\nmiss taylor\\n\\nwhere is the young man said john knightley  has he been here\\non this occasionor has he not\\n\\nhe has not been here yet replied emma  there was a strong\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage but it ended\\nin nothing and i have not heard him mentioned lately\\n\\nbut you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father\\nhe wrote a letter to poor mrs weston to congratulate her\\nand a very proper handsome letter it was  she shewed it to me\\ni thought it very well done of him indeed  whether it was his own idea\\nyou know one cannot tell  he is but young and his uncle perhaps\\n\\nmy dear papa he is threeandtwenty you forget how time passes\\n\\nthreeandtwentyis he indeedwell i could not have thought it\\nand he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother  well\\ntime does fly indeedand my memory is very bad  however it was\\nan exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston\\na great deal of pleasure  i remember it was written from weymouth\\nand dated sept 28thand began my dear madam but i forget\\nhow it went on and it was signed f c weston churchill\\ni remember that perfectly\\n\\nhow very pleasing and proper of him cried the goodhearted mrs john\\nknightley  i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man\\nbut how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father\\nthere is something so shocking in a childs being taken away from his\\nparents and natural home  i never could comprehend how mr weston\\ncould part with him  to give up ones child  i really never\\ncould think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else\\n\\nnobody ever did think well of the churchills i fancy\\nobserved mr john knightley coolly  but you need not imagine\\nmr weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up henry\\nor john  mr weston is rather an easy cheerfultempered man\\nthan a man of strong feelings he takes things as he finds them\\nand makes enjoyment of them somehow or other depending i suspect\\nmuch more upon what is called society for his comforts that is\\nupon the power of eating and drinking and playing whist with his\\nneighbours five times a week than upon family affection or any\\nthing that home affords\\n\\nemma could not like what bordered on a reflection on mr weston\\nand had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let\\nit pass  she would keep the peace if possible and there was\\nsomething honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits\\nthe allsufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brothers\\ndisposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse\\nand those to whom it was importantit had a high claim to forbearance\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xii\\n\\n\\nmr knightley was to dine with themrather against the inclination\\nof mr woodhouse who did not like that any one should share with him\\nin isabellas first day  emmas sense of right however had decided it\\nand besides the consideration of what was due to each brother\\nshe had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late\\ndisagreement between mr knightley and herself in procuring him\\nthe proper invitation\\n\\nshe hoped they might now become friends again  she thought it\\nwas time to make up  makingup indeed would not do  she certainly\\nhad not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had\\nconcession must be out of the question but it was time to appear\\nto forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather\\nassist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room\\nshe had one of the children with herthe youngest a nice little girl\\nabout eight months old who was now making her first visit to hartfield\\nand very happy to be danced about in her aunts arms  it did assist\\nfor though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon\\nled on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child\\nout of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity\\nemma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving\\nher at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness\\nshe could not help saying as he was admiring the baby\\n\\nwhat a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces\\nas to men and women our opinions are sometimes very different\\nbut with regard to these children i observe we never disagree\\n\\nif you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men\\nand women and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your\\ndealings with them as you are where these children are concerned\\nwe might always think alike\\n\\nto be sureour discordancies must always arise from my being\\nin the wrong\\n\\nyes said he smilingand reason good  i was sixteen years\\nold when you were born\\n\\na material difference then she repliedand no doubt you were\\nmuch my superior in judgment at that period of our lives but does\\nnot the lapse of oneandtwenty years bring our understandings\\na good deal nearer\\n\\nyesa good deal nearer\\n\\nbut still not near enough to give me a chance of being right\\nif we think differently\\n\\ni have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by\\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child  come my dear emma\\nlet us be friends and say no more about it  tell your aunt little emma\\nthat she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\\nold grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now\\n\\nthats true she criedvery true  little emma grow up\\na better woman than your aunt  be infinitely cleverer and not\\nhalf so conceited  now mr knightley a word or two more and i\\nhave done  as far as good intentions went we were both right\\nand i must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet\\nproved wrong  i only want to know that mr martin is not very\\nvery bitterly disappointed\\n\\na man cannot be more so was his short full answer\\n\\nahindeed i am very sorrycome shake hands with me\\n\\nthis had just taken place and with great cordiality when john\\nknightley made his appearance and how dye do george and john\\nhow are you succeeded in the true english style burying under\\na calmness that seemed all but indifference the real attachment\\nwhich would have led either of them if requisite to do every thing\\nfor the good of the other\\n\\nthe evening was quiet and conversable as mr woodhouse declined\\ncards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his\\ndear isabella and the little party made two natural divisions\\non one side he and his daughter on the other the two mr knightleys\\ntheir subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixingand emma\\nonly occasionally joining in one or the other\\n\\nthe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally\\nof those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative\\nand who was always the greater talker  as a magistrate he had\\ngenerally some point of law to consult john about or at least\\nsome curious anecdote to give and as a farmer as keeping in hand\\nthe homefarm at donwell he had to tell what every field was to bear\\nnext year and to give all such local information as could not fail\\nof being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been\\nthe longest part of his life and whose attachments were strong\\nthe plan of a drain the change of a fence the felling of a tree\\nand the destination of every acre for wheat turnips or spring corn\\nwas entered into with as much equality of interest by john as his\\ncooler manners rendered possible and if his willing brother ever\\nleft him any thing to inquire about his inquiries even approached\\na tone of eagerness\\n\\nwhile they were thus comfortably occupied mr woodhouse was enjoying\\na full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter\\n\\nmy poor dear isabella said he fondly taking her hand\\nand interrupting for a few moments her busy labours for some one\\nof her five childrenhow long it is how terribly long since you\\nwere here  and how tired you must be after your journey  you must\\ngo to bed early my dearand i recommend a little gruel to you\\nbefore you goyou and i will have a nice basin of gruel together\\nmy dear emma suppose we all have a little gruel\\n\\nemma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did\\nthat both the mr knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article\\nas herselfand two basins only were ordered  after a little\\nmore discourse in praise of gruel with some wondering at its\\nnot being taken every evening by every body he proceeded to say\\nwith an air of grave reflection\\n\\nit was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn\\nat south end instead of coming here  i never had much opinion\\nof the sea air\\n\\nmr wingfield most strenuously recommended it siror we\\nshould not have gone  he recommended it for all the children\\nbut particularly for the weakness in little bellas throat\\nboth sea air and bathing\\n\\nah my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her\\nany good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced\\nthough perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very\\nrarely of use to any body  i am sure it almost killed me once\\n\\ncome come cried emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject i must\\nbeg you not to talk of the sea  it makes me envious and miserable\\ni who have never seen it  south end is prohibited if you please\\nmy dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about\\nmr perry yet and he never forgets you\\n\\noh good mr perryhow is he sir\\n\\nwhy pretty well but not quite well  poor perry is bilious\\nand he has not time to take care of himselfhe tells me he has\\nnot time to take care of himselfwhich is very sadbut he is\\nalways wanted all round the country  i suppose there is not a man\\nin such practice anywhere  but then there is not so clever a man\\nany where\\n\\nand mrs perry and the children how are they do the children grow\\ni have a great regard for mr perry  i hope he will be calling soon\\nhe will be so pleased to see my little ones\\n\\ni hope he will be here tomorrow for i have a question or two to ask\\nhim about myself of some consequence  and my dear whenever he comes\\nyou had better let him look at little bellas throat\\n\\noh my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly\\nany uneasiness about it  either bathing has been of the greatest\\nservice to her or else it is to be attributed to an excellent\\nembrocation of mr wingfields which we have been applying\\nat times ever since august\\n\\nit is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been\\nof use to herand if i had known you were wanting an embrocation\\ni would have spoken to\\n\\nyou seem to me to have forgotten mrs and miss bates said emma\\ni have not heard one inquiry after them\\n\\noh the good batesesi am quite ashamed of myselfbut you\\nmention them in most of your letters  i hope they are quite well\\ngood old mrs batesi will call upon her tomorrow and take\\nmy childrenthey are always so pleased to see my children\\nand that excellent miss batessuch thorough worthy people\\nhow are they sir\\n\\nwhy pretty well my dear upon the whole  but poor mrs bates\\nhad a bad cold about a month ago\\n\\nhow sorry i am  but colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\nthis autumn  mr wingfield told me that he has never known them\\nmore general or heavyexcept when it has been quite an influenza\\n\\nthat has been a good deal the case my dear but not to the degree\\nyou mention  perry says that colds have been very general\\nbut not so heavy as he has very often known them in november\\nperry does not call it altogether a sickly season\\n\\nno i do not know that mr wingfield considers it very sickly except\\n\\nah my poor dear child the truth is that in london it is always\\na sickly season  nobody is healthy in london nobody can be\\nit is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there so far off\\nand the air so bad\\n\\nno indeedwe are not at all in a bad air  our part of london is\\nvery superior to most othersyou must not confound us with london\\nin general my dear sir  the neighbourhood of brunswick square\\nis very different from almost all the rest  we are so very airy\\ni should be unwilling i own to live in any other part of the town\\nthere is hardly any other that i could be satisfied to have my\\nchildren in  but we are so remarkably airymr wingfield thinks\\nthe vicinity of brunswick square decidedly the most favourable as\\nto air\\n\\nah my dear it is not like hartfield  you make the best of it\\nbut after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you\\ndifferent creatures you do not look like the same  now i cannot say\\nthat i think you are any of you looking well at present\\n\\ni am sorry to hear you say so sir but i assure you excepting those\\nlittle nervous headaches and palpitations which i am never entirely\\nfree from anywhere i am quite well myself and if the children were\\nrather pale before they went to bed it was only because they were\\na little more tired than usual from their journey and the happiness\\nof coming  i hope you will think better of their looks tomorrow\\nfor i assure you mr wingfield told me that he did not believe\\nhe had ever sent us off altogether in such good case  i trust\\nat least that you do not think mr knightley looking ill\\nturning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband\\n\\nmiddling my dear i cannot compliment you  i think mr john\\nknightley very far from looking well\\n\\nwhat is the matter sirdid you speak to me cried mr john\\nknightley hearing his own name\\n\\ni am sorry to find my love that my father does not think you\\nlooking wellbut i hope it is only from being a little fatigued\\ni could have wished however as you know that you had seen\\nmr wingfield before you left home\\n\\nmy dear isabellaexclaimed he hastilypray do not concern\\nyourself about my looks  be satisfied with doctoring and coddling\\nyourself and the children and let me look as i chuse\\n\\ni did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother\\ncried emma about your friend mr grahams intending to have a bailiff\\nfrom scotland to look after his new estate  what will it answer\\nwill not the old prejudice be too strong\\n\\nand she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced\\nto give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing\\nworse to hear than isabellas kind inquiry after jane fairfax\\nand jane fairfax though no great favourite with her in general\\nshe was at that moment very happy to assist in praising\\n\\nthat sweet amiable jane fairfax said mrs john knightley\\nit is so long since i have seen her except now and then for a moment\\naccidentally in town  what happiness it must be to her good old\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt when she comes to visit them\\ni always regret excessively on dear emmas account that she cannot\\nbe more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose\\ncolonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all\\nshe would be such a delightful companion for emma\\n\\nmr woodhouse agreed to it all but added\\n\\nour little friend harriet smith however is just such another\\npretty kind of young person  you will like harriet  emma could\\nnot have a better companion than harriet\\n\\ni am most happy to hear itbut only jane fairfax one knows to be\\nso very accomplished and superiorand exactly emmas age\\n\\nthis topic was discussed very happily and others succeeded of\\nsimilar moment and passed away with similar harmony but the evening\\ndid not close without a little return of agitation  the gruel came\\nand supplied a great deal to be saidmuch praise and many comments\\nundoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution\\nand pretty severe philippics upon the many houses where it was\\nnever met with tolerablebut unfortunately among the failures\\nwhich the daughter had to instance the most recent and therefore\\nmost prominent was in her own cook at south end a young woman\\nhired for the time who never had been able to understand what she\\nmeant by a basin of nice smooth gruel thin but not too thin\\noften as she had wished for and ordered it she had never been able\\nto get any thing tolerable  here was a dangerous opening\\n\\nah said mr woodhouse shaking his head and fixing his eyes on\\nher with tender concernthe ejaculation in emmas ear expressed\\nah there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to\\nsouth end  it does not bear talking of  and for a little while\\nshe hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination\\nmight suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel\\nafter an interval of some minutes however he began with\\n\\ni shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn\\ninstead of coming here\\n\\nbut why should you be sorry siri assure you it did the children\\na great deal of good\\n\\nand moreover if you must go to the sea it had better not\\nhave been to south end  south end is an unhealthy place\\nperry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon south end\\n\\ni know there is such an idea with many people but indeed it is\\nquite a mistake sirwe all had our health perfectly well there\\nnever found the least inconvenience from the mud and mr wingfield\\nsays it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy\\nand i am sure he may be depended on for he thoroughly understands\\nthe nature of the air and his own brother and family have been\\nthere repeatedly\\n\\nyou should have gone to cromer my dear if you went anywhere\\nperry was a week at cromer once and he holds it to be the best\\nof all the seabathing places  a fine open sea he says and very\\npure air  and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there\\nquite away from the seaa quarter of a mile offvery comfortable\\nyou should have consulted perry\\n\\nbut my dear sir the difference of the journeyonly consider how\\ngreat it would have beenan hundred miles perhaps instead of forty\\n\\nah my dear as perry says where health is at stake nothing else\\nshould be considered and if one is to travel there is not much\\nto chuse between forty miles and an hundredbetter not move at all\\nbetter stay in london altogether than travel forty miles to get\\ninto a worse air  this is just what perry said  it seemed to him\\na very illjudged measure\\n\\nemmas attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he\\nhad reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her\\nbrotherinlaws breaking out\\n\\nmr perry said he in a voice of very strong displeasure\\nwould do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for\\nwhy does he make it any business of his to wonder at what i do\\nat my taking my family to one part of the coast or anotheri may\\nbe allowed i hope the use of my judgment as well as mr perry\\ni want his directions no more than his drugs  he paused\\nand growing cooler in a moment added with only sarcastic dryness\\nif mr perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children\\na distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense\\nor inconvenience than a distance of forty i should be as willing to\\nprefer cromer to south end as he could himself\\n\\ntrue true cried mr knightley with most ready interposition\\nvery true  thats a consideration indeedbut john as to what i\\nwas telling you of my idea of moving the path to langham of turning\\nit more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows\\ni cannot conceive any difficulty  i should not attempt it\\nif it were to be the means of inconvenience to the highbury people\\nbut if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path   \\nthe only way of proving it however will be to turn to our maps\\ni shall see you at the abbey tomorrow morning i hope and then we\\nwill look them over and you shall give me your opinion\\n\\nmr woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on\\nhis friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously\\nbeen attributing many of his own feelings and expressions\\nbut the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed\\nthe present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother\\nand better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiii\\n\\n\\nthere could hardly be a happier creature in the world than mrs john\\nknightley in this short visit to hartfield going about every morning\\namong her old acquaintance with her five children and talking\\nover what she had done every evening with her father and sister\\nshe had nothing to wish otherwise but that the days did not pass\\nso swiftly  it was a delightful visitperfect in being much too short\\n\\nin general their evenings were less engaged with friends than\\ntheir mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out\\nof the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas\\nmr weston would take no denial they must all dine at randalls\\none dayeven mr woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible\\nthing in preference to a division of the party\\n\\nhow they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty\\nif he could but as his son and daughters carriage and horses\\nwere actually at hartfield he was not able to make more than\\na simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt\\nnor did it occupy emma long to convince him that they might in one\\nof the carriages find room for harriet also\\n\\nharriet mr elton and mr knightley their own especial set\\nwere the only persons invited to meet themthe hours were to be early\\nas well as the numbers few mr woodhouses habits and inclination\\nbeing consulted in every thing\\n\\nthe evening before this great event for it was a very great event\\nthat mr woodhouse should dine out on the 24th of december had been\\nspent by harriet at hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed\\nwith a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed\\nby mrs goddard emma could not have allowed her to leave the house\\nemma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed\\nwith regard to randalls  she was very feverish and had a bad\\nsore throat  mrs goddard was full of care and affection mr perry\\nwas talked of and harriet herself was too ill and low to resist\\nthe authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement\\nthough she could not speak of her loss without many tears\\n\\nemma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in mrs goddards\\nunavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much\\nmr eltons would be depressed when he knew her state and left her\\nat last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having\\na most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much\\nshe had not advanced many yards from mrs goddards door when she\\nwas met by mr elton himself evidently coming towards it and as\\nthey walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid\\nof whom he on the rumour of considerable illness had been going\\nto inquire that he might carry some report of her to hartfield\\nthey were overtaken by mr john knightley returning from the\\ndaily visit to donwell with his two eldest boys whose healthy\\nglowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run and seemed\\nto ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they\\nwere hastening home for  they joined company and proceeded together\\nemma was just describing the nature of her friends complaint\\na throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her\\na quick low pulse c  and she was sorry to find from mrs goddard\\nthat harriet was liable to very bad sorethroats and had often\\nalarmed her with them  mr elton looked all alarm on the occasion\\nas he exclaimed\\n\\na sorethroati hope not infectious  i hope not of a putrid\\ninfectious sort  has perry seen her  indeed you should take care\\nof yourself as well as of your friend  let me entreat you to run\\nno risks  why does not perry see her\\n\\nemma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this\\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of mrs goddards experience\\nand care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness\\nwhich she could not wish to reason away which she would rather\\nfeed and assist than not she added soon afterwardsas if quite\\nanother subject\\n\\nit is so cold so very coldand looks and feels so very much\\nlike snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party\\ni should really try not to go out todayand dissuade my father\\nfrom venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem\\nto feel the cold himself i do not like to interfere as i know it\\nwould be so great a disappointment to mr and mrs weston  but upon\\nmy word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself\\nyou appear to me a little hoarse already and when you consider\\nwhat demand of voice and what fatigues tomorrow will bring\\ni think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home\\nand take care of yourself tonight\\n\\nmr elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make\\nwhich was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind\\ncare of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of\\nhers he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit\\nbut emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions\\nand views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision\\nwas very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its\\nbeing very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in\\nhaving extricated him from randalls and secured him the power\\nof sending to inquire after harriet every hour of the evening\\n\\nyou do quite right said shewe will make your apologies\\nto mr and mrs weston\\n\\nbut hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly\\noffering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr eltons\\nonly objection and mr elton actually accepting the offer with much\\nprompt satisfaction  it was a done thing mr elton was to go\\nand never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than\\nat this moment never had his smile been stronger nor his eyes\\nmore exulting than when he next looked at her\\n\\nwell said she to herself this is most strangeafter i\\nhad got him off so well to chuse to go into company and leave\\nharriet ill behindmost strange indeedbut there is i believe\\nin many men especially single men such an inclination\\nsuch a passion for dining outa dinner engagement is so high in\\nthe class of their pleasures their employments their dignities\\nalmost their duties that any thing gives way to itand this must\\nbe the case with mr elton a most valuable amiable pleasing young\\nman undoubtedly and very much in love with harriet but still\\nhe cannot refuse an invitation he must dine out wherever he is asked\\nwhat a strange thing love is he can see ready wit in harriet\\nbut will not dine alone for her\\n\\nsoon afterwards mr elton quitted them and she could not but do him\\nthe justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment\\nin his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his\\nvoice while assuring her that he should call at mrs goddards\\nfor news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared\\nfor the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be\\nable to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself\\noff in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour\\n\\nafter a few minutes of entire silence between them john knightley\\nbegan with\\n\\ni never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than\\nmr elton  it is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned\\nwith men he can be rational and unaffected but when he has ladies\\nto please every feature works\\n\\nmr eltons manners are not perfect replied emma but where there\\nis a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook\\na great deal  where a man does his best with only moderate powers\\nhe will have the advantage over negligent superiority  there is\\nsuch perfect goodtemper and goodwill in mr elton as one cannot\\nbut value\\n\\nyes said mr john knightley presently with some slyness\\nhe seems to have a great deal of goodwill towards you\\n\\nme she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining\\nme to be mr eltons object\\n\\nsuch an imagination has crossed me i own emma and if it never\\noccurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now\\n\\nmr elton in love with mewhat an idea\\n\\ni do not say it is so but you will do well to consider whether\\nit is so or not and to regulate your behaviour accordingly\\ni think your manners to him encouraging  i speak as a friend\\nemma  you had better look about you and ascertain what you do\\nand what you mean to do\\n\\ni thank you but i assure you you are quite mistaken  mr elton\\nand i are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on\\namusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often\\narise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes\\nwhich people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into\\nand not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind\\nand ignorant and in want of counsel  he said no more\\n\\nmr woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit\\nthat in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea\\nof shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually\\nwith his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent\\nconsciousness of the weather than either of the others too full\\nof the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at\\nrandalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it\\nthe cold however was severe and by the time the second carriage\\nwas in motion a few flakes of snow were finding their way down\\nand the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only\\na milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time\\n\\nemma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour\\nthe preparing and the going abroad in such weather with the sacrifice\\nof his children after dinner were evils were disagreeables at least\\nwhich mr john knightley did not by any means like he anticipated\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase\\nand the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in\\nexpressing his discontent\\n\\na man said he must have a very good opinion of himself when\\nhe asks people to leave their own fireside and encounter such\\na day as this for the sake of coming to see him  he must think\\nhimself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing\\nit is the greatest absurdityactually snowing at this moment\\nthe folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at homeand the\\nfolly of peoples not staying comfortably at home when they can\\nif we were obliged to go out such an evening as this by any call of\\nduty or business what a hardship we should deem itand here are we\\nprobably with rather thinner clothing than usual setting forward\\nvoluntarily without excuse in defiance of the voice of nature\\nwhich tells man in every thing given to his view or his feelings\\nto stay at home himself and keep all under shelter that he can\\nhere are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another\\nmans house with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\nand heard yesterday and may not be said and heard again tomorrow\\ngoing in dismal weather to return probably in worsefour horses\\nand four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle\\nshivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they\\nmight have had at home\\n\\nemma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt\\nhe was in the habit of receiving to emulate the very true my love\\nwhich must have been usually administered by his travelling companion\\nbut she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer\\nat all  she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome\\nher heroism reached only to silence  she allowed him to talk\\nand arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening\\nher lips\\n\\nthey arrived the carriage turned the step was let down\\nand mr elton spruce black and smiling was with them instantly\\nemma thought with pleasure of some change of subject  mr elton\\nwas all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful\\nin his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have\\nreceived a different account of harriet from what had reached her\\nshe had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same\\nnot better\\n\\nmy report from mrs goddards said she presently was not\\nso pleasant as i had hopednot better was my answer\\n\\nhis face lengthened immediately and his voice was the voice\\nof sentiment as he answered\\n\\noh noi am grieved to findi was on the point of telling you that\\nwhen i called at mrs goddards door which i did the very last thing\\nbefore i returned to dress i was told that miss smith was not better\\nby no means better rather worse  very much grieved and concerned\\ni had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial\\nas i knew had been given her in the morning\\n\\nemma smiled and answeredmy visit was of use to the nervous part\\nof her complaint i hope but not even i can charm away a sore throat\\nit is a most severe cold indeed  mr perry has been with her\\nas you probably heard\\n\\nyesi imaginedthat isi did not\\n\\nhe has been used to her in these complaints and i hope tomorrow\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report  but it is\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness  such a sad loss to our party today\\n\\ndreadfulexactly so indeedshe will be missed every moment\\n\\nthis was very proper the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable\\nbut it should have lasted longer  emma was rather in dismay when\\nonly half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment\\n\\nwhat an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin\\nfor carriages  how very comfortable they make itimpossible to\\nfeel cold with such precautions  the contrivances of modern days\\nindeed have rendered a gentlemans carriage perfectly complete\\none is so fenced and guarded from the weather that not a breath\\nof air can find its way unpermitted  weather becomes absolutely\\nof no consequence  it is a very cold afternoonbut in this carriage\\nwe know nothing of the matterha snows a little i see\\n\\nyes said john knightley and i think we shall have a good deal\\nof it\\n\\nchristmas weather observed mr elton  quite seasonable\\nand extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not\\nbegin yesterday and prevent this days party which it might very\\npossibly have done for mr woodhouse would hardly have ventured had\\nthere been much snow on the ground but now it is of no consequence\\nthis is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings  at christmas\\nevery body invites their friends about them and people think little\\nof even the worst weather  i was snowed up at a friends house once\\nfor a week  nothing could be pleasanter  i went for only one night\\nand could not get away till that very day sennight\\n\\nmr john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure\\nbut said only coolly\\n\\ni cannot wish to be snowed up a week at randalls\\n\\nat another time emma might have been amused but she was too\\nmuch astonished now at mr eltons spirits for other feelings\\nharriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party\\n\\nwe are sure of excellent fires continued he and every thing\\nin the greatest comfort  charming people mr and mrs weston\\nmrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly\\nwhat one values so hospitable and so fond of society\\nit will be a small party but where small parties are select\\nthey are perhaps the most agreeable of any  mr westons diningroom\\ndoes not accommodate more than ten comfortably and for my part\\ni would rather under such circumstances fall short by two than\\nexceed by two  i think you will agree with me turning with a soft\\nair to emma i think i shall certainly have your approbation\\nthough mr knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties\\nof london may not quite enter into our feelings\\n\\ni know nothing of the large parties of london siri never dine\\nwith any body\\n\\nindeed in a tone of wonder and pity i had no idea that the\\nlaw had been so great a slavery  well sir the time must come\\nwhen you will be paid for all this when you will have little\\nlabour and great enjoyment\\n\\nmy first enjoyment replied john knightley as they passed through\\nthe sweepgate will be to find myself safe at hartfield again\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiv\\n\\n\\nsome change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman\\nas they walked into mrs westons drawingroommr elton must\\ncompose his joyous looks and mr john knightley disperse his\\nillhumour mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more\\nto fit them for the placeemma only might be as nature prompted\\nand shew herself just as happy as she was  to her it was real\\nenjoyment to be with the westons  mr weston was a great favourite\\nand there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with\\nsuch unreserve as to his wife not any one to whom she related\\nwith such conviction of being listened to and understood of being\\nalways interesting and always intelligible the little affairs\\narrangements perplexities and pleasures of her father and herself\\nshe could tell nothing of hartfield in which mrs weston had not\\na lively concern and half an hours uninterrupted communication\\nof all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private\\nlife depends was one of the first gratifications of each\\n\\nthis was a pleasure which perhaps the whole days visit might\\nnot afford which certainly did not belong to the present halfhour\\nbut the very sight of mrs weston her smile her touch her voice\\nwas grateful to emma and she determined to think as little as\\npossible of mr eltons oddities or of any thing else unpleasant\\nand enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost\\n\\nthe misfortune of harriets cold had been pretty well gone through\\nbefore her arrival  mr woodhouse had been safely seated long\\nenough to give the history of it besides all the history of his own\\nand isabellas coming and of emmas being to follow and had indeed\\njust got to the end of his satisfaction that james should come\\nand see his daughter when the others appeared and mrs weston\\nwho had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him\\nwas able to turn away and welcome her dear emma\\n\\nemmas project of forgetting mr elton for a while made her rather\\nsorry to find when they had all taken their places that he was\\nclose to her  the difficulty was great of driving his strange\\ninsensibility towards harriet from her mind while he not only sat\\nat her elbow but was continually obtruding his happy countenance\\non her notice and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion\\ninstead of forgetting him his behaviour was such that she could\\nnot avoid the internal suggestion of can it really be as my brother\\nimagined can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer\\nhis affections from harriet to meabsurd and insufferable\\nyet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm would be\\nso interested about her father and so delighted with mrs weston\\nand at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal\\nand so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a wouldbe lover\\nand made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners\\nfor her own sake she could not be rude and for harriets in the hope\\nthat all would yet turn out right she was even positively civil\\nbut it was an effort especially as something was going on amongst\\nthe others in the most overpowering period of mr eltons nonsense\\nwhich she particularly wished to listen to  she heard enough\\nto know that mr weston was giving some information about his son\\nshe heard the words my son and frank and my son\\nrepeated several times over and from a few other halfsyllables\\nvery much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from\\nhis son but before she could quiet mr elton the subject was\\nso completely past that any reviving question from her would have\\nbeen awkward\\n\\nnow it so happened that in spite of emmas resolution of never marrying\\nthere was something in the name in the idea of mr frank churchill\\nwhich always interested her  she had frequently thoughtespecially since\\nhis fathers marriage with miss taylorthat if she were to marry\\nhe was the very person to suit her in age character and condition\\nhe seemed by this connexion between the families quite to belong to her\\nshe could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew\\nthem must think of  that mr and mrs weston did think of it she was\\nvery strongly persuaded and though not meaning to be induced by him\\nor by any body else to give up a situation which she believed more\\nreplete with good than any she could change it for she had a great\\ncuriosity to see him a decided intention of finding him pleasant\\nof being liked by him to a certain degree and a sort of pleasure\\nin the idea of their being coupled in their friends imaginations\\n\\nwith such sensations mr eltons civilities were dreadfully illtimed\\nbut she had the comfort of appearing very polite while feeling\\nvery crossand of thinking that the rest of the visit could not\\npossibly pass without bringing forward the same information again\\nor the substance of it from the openhearted mr westonso it proved\\nfor when happily released from mr elton and seated by mr weston\\nat dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares\\nof hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton\\nto say to her\\n\\nwe want only two more to be just the right number  i should\\nlike to see two more hereyour pretty little friend miss smith\\nand my sonand then i should say we were quite complete\\ni believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawingroom\\nthat we are expecting frank  i had a letter from him this morning\\nand he will be with us within a fortnight\\n\\nemma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented\\nto his proposition of mr frank churchill and miss smith making\\ntheir party quite complete\\n\\nhe has been wanting to come to us continued mr weston\\never since september  every letter has been full of it\\nbut he cannot command his own time  he has those to please\\nwho must be pleased and who between ourselves are sometimes\\nto be pleased only by a good many sacrifices  but now\\ni have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in january\\n\\nwhat a very great pleasure it will be to you and mrs weston\\nis so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost\\nas happy as yourself\\n\\nyes she would be but that she thinks there will be another\\nputoff she does not depend upon his coming so much as i do\\nbut she does not know the parties so well as i do  the case\\nyou see isbut this is quite between ourselves  i did not mention\\na syllable of it in the other room  there are secrets in all families\\nyou knowthe case is that a party of friends are invited to pay\\na visit at enscombe in january and that franks coming depends upon\\ntheir being put off  if they are not put off he cannot stir\\nbut i know they will because it is a family that a certain lady\\nof some consequence at enscombe has a particular dislike to\\nand though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or\\nthree years they always are put off when it comes to the point\\ni have not the smallest doubt of the issue  i am as confident\\nof seeing frank here before the middle of january as i am\\nof being here myself  but your good friend there nodding\\ntowards the upper end of the table has so few vagaries herself\\nand has been so little used to them at hartfield that she cannot\\ncalculate on their effects as i have been long in the practice\\nof doing\\n\\ni am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case\\nreplied emma but am disposed to side with you mr weston  if you\\nthink he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe\\n\\nyesi have some right to that knowledge though i have never been\\nat the place in my lifeshe is an odd womanbut i never allow\\nmyself to speak ill of her on franks account for i do believe\\nher to be very fond of him  i used to think she was not capable\\nof being fond of any body except herself  but she has always been\\nkind to him in her wayallowing for little whims and caprices\\nand expecting every thing to be as she likes and it is no small credit\\nin my opinion to him that he should excite such an affection\\nfor though i would not say it to any body else she has no more\\nheart than a stone to people in general and the devil of a temper\\n\\nemma liked the subject so well that she began upon it to mrs weston\\nvery soon after their moving into the drawingroom wishing her joy\\nyet observing that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming\\nmrs weston agreed to it but added that she should be very\\nglad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting\\nat the time talked of  for i cannot depend upon his coming\\ni cannot be so sanguine as mr weston  i am very much afraid\\nthat it will all end in nothing  mr weston i dare say has been\\ntelling you exactly how the matter stands\\n\\nyesit seems to depend upon nothing but the illhumour\\nof mrs churchill which i imagine to be the most certain\\nthing in the world\\n\\nmy emma replied mrs weston smiling what is the certainty\\nof caprice  then turning to isabella who had not been\\nattending beforeyou must know my dear mrs knightley\\nthat we are by no means so sure of seeing mr frank churchill\\nin my opinion as his father thinks  it depends entirely upon\\nhis aunts spirits and pleasure in short upon her temper\\nto youto my two daughtersi may venture on the truth\\nmrs churchill rules at enscombe and is a very oddtempered woman\\nand his coming now depends upon her being willing to spare him\\n\\noh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill\\nreplied isabella  and i am sure i never think of that poor young\\nman without the greatest compassion  to be constantly living\\nwith an illtempered person must be dreadful  it is what we\\nhappily have never known any thing of but it must be a life\\nof misery  what a blessing that she never had any children\\npoor little creatures how unhappy she would have made them\\n\\nemma wished she had been alone with mrs weston  she should then have\\nheard more  mrs weston would speak to her with a degree of unreserve\\nwhich she would not hazard with isabella and she really believed\\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the churchills\\nfrom her excepting those views on the young man of which her own\\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge\\nbut at present there was nothing more to be said  mr woodhouse\\nvery soon followed them into the drawingroom to be sitting\\nlong after dinner was a confinement that he could not endure\\nneither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did\\nhe move to those with whom he was always comfortable\\n\\nwhile he talked to isabella however emma found an opportunity\\nof saying\\n\\nand so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any\\nmeans certain  i am sorry for it  the introduction must be unpleasant\\nwhenever it takes place and the sooner it could be over the better\\n\\nyes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays\\neven if this family the braithwaites are put off i am still\\nafraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us\\ni cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side but i am sure\\nthere is a great wish on the churchills to keep him to themselves\\nthere is jealousy  they are jealous even of his regard for his father\\nin short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston\\nwere less sanguine\\n\\nhe ought to come said emma  if he could stay only a couple\\nof days he ought to come and one can hardly conceive a young mans\\nnot having it in his power to do as much as that  a young woman\\nif she fall into bad hands may be teazed and kept at a distance\\nfrom those she wants to be with but one cannot comprehend a young\\nmans being under such restraint as not to be able to spend a week\\nwith his father if he likes it\\n\\none ought to be at enscombe and know the ways of the family\\nbefore one decides upon what he can do replied mrs weston\\none ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the\\nconduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe\\ni believe certainly must not be judged by general rules\\nshe is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her\\n\\nbut she is so fond of the nephew  he is so very great a favourite\\nnow according to my idea of mrs churchill it would be most natural\\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband\\nto whom she owes every thing while she exercises incessant caprice\\ntowards him she should frequently be governed by the nephew\\nto whom she owes nothing at all\\n\\nmy dearest emma do not pretend with your sweet temper\\nto understand a bad one or to lay down rules for it  you must\\nlet it go its own way  i have no doubt of his having at times\\nconsiderable influence but it may be perfectly impossible for him\\nto know beforehand when it will be\\n\\nemma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied\\nunless he comes\\n\\nhe may have a great deal of influence on some points\\ncontinued mrs weston and on others very little  and among those\\non which she is beyond his reach it is but too likely may be\\nthis very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xv\\n\\n\\nmr woodhouse was soon ready for his tea and when he had drank his\\ntea he was quite ready to go home and it was as much as his three\\ncompanions could do to entertain away his notice of the lateness\\nof the hour before the other gentlemen appeared  mr weston was\\nchatty and convivial and no friend to early separations of any sort\\nbut at last the drawingroom party did receive an augmentation\\nmr elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in\\nmrs weston and emma were sitting together on a sofa  he joined\\nthem immediately and with scarcely an invitation seated himself\\nbetween them\\n\\nemma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind\\nby the expectation of mr frank churchill was willing to forget\\nhis late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before\\nand on his making harriet his very first subject was ready to listen\\nwith most friendly smiles\\n\\nhe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend\\nher fair lovely amiable friend  did she knowhad she\\nheard any thing about her since their being at randalls\\nhe felt much anxietyhe must confess that the nature of her\\ncomplaint alarmed him considerably  and in this style he talked\\non for some time very properly not much attending to any answer\\nbut altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat\\nand emma was quite in charity with him\\n\\nbut at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if\\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account\\nthan on harrietsmore anxious that she should escape the infection\\nthan that there should be no infection in the complaint  he began\\nwith great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting\\nthe sickchamber again for the presentto entreat her to promise\\nhim not to venture into such hazard till he had seen mr perry\\nand learnt his opinion and though she tried to laugh it off\\nand bring the subject back into its proper course there was no\\nputting an end to his extreme solicitude about her  she was vexed\\nit did appearthere was no concealing itexactly like the pretence\\nof being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy\\nif real the most contemptible and abominable and she had difficulty\\nin behaving with temper  he turned to mrs weston to implore\\nher assistance would not she give him her supportwould not she\\nadd her persuasions to his to induce miss woodhouse not to go\\nto mrs goddards till it were certain that miss smiths disorder\\nhad no infection  he could not be satisfied without a promise\\nwould not she give him her influence in procuring it\\n\\nso scrupulous for others he continued and yet so careless\\nfor herself  she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home today\\nand yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated\\nsore throat herself  is this fair mrs westonjudge between us\\nhave not i some right to complain  i am sure of your kind support\\nand aid\\n\\nemma saw mrs westons surprize and felt that it must be great\\nat an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself\\nthe right of first interest in her and as for herself she was\\ntoo much provoked and offended to have the power of directly\\nsaying any thing to the purpose  she could only give him a look\\nbut it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses\\nand then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving\\nher all her attention\\n\\nshe had not time to know how mr elton took the reproof so rapidly\\ndid another subject succeed for mr john knightley now came\\ninto the room from examining the weather and opened on them\\nall with the information of the ground being covered with snow\\nand of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind\\nconcluding with these words to mr woodhouse\\n\\nthis will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements\\nsir  something new for your coachman and horses to be making\\ntheir way through a storm of snow\\n\\npoor mr woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else\\nhad something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized\\nand had some question to ask or some comfort to offer  mrs weston\\nand emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention\\nfrom his soninlaw who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly\\n\\ni admired your resolution very much sir said he in venturing\\nout in such weather for of course you saw there would be snow\\nvery soon  every body must have seen the snow coming on\\ni admired your spirit and i dare say we shall get home very well\\nanother hour or twos snow can hardly make the road impassable\\nand we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part\\nof the common field there will be the other at hand  i dare say we\\nshall be all safe at hartfield before midnight\\n\\nmr weston with triumph of a different sort was confessing that he\\nhad known it to be snowing some time but had not said a word\\nlest it should make mr woodhouse uncomfortable and be an excuse\\nfor his hurrying away  as to there being any quantity of snow fallen\\nor likely to fall to impede their return that was a mere joke\\nhe was afraid they would find no difficulty  he wished the road might\\nbe impassable that he might be able to keep them all at randalls\\nand with the utmost goodwill was sure that accommodation might\\nbe found for every body calling on his wife to agree with him\\nthat with a little contrivance every body might be lodged\\nwhich she hardly knew how to do from the consciousness of there\\nbeing but two spare rooms in the house\\n\\nwhat is to be done my dear emmawhat is to be done\\nwas mr woodhouses first exclamation and all that he could say\\nfor some time  to her he looked for comfort and her assurances\\nof safety her representation of the excellence of the horses\\nand of james and of their having so many friends about them\\nrevived him a little\\n\\nhis eldest daughters alarm was equal to his own  the horror of\\nbeing blocked up at randalls while her children were at hartfield\\nwas full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just\\npassable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay\\nshe was eager to have it settled that her father and emma should remain\\nat randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through\\nall the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them\\n\\nyou had better order the carriage directly my love said she\\ni dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly\\nand if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk\\ni am not at all afraid  i should not mind walking half the way\\ni could change my shoes you know the moment i got home and it is not\\nthe sort of thing that gives me cold\\n\\nindeed replied he  then my dear isabella it is the most\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world for in general every\\nthing does give you cold  walk homeyou are prettily shod\\nfor walking home i dare say  it will be bad enough for the horses\\n\\nisabella turned to mrs weston for her approbation of the plan\\nmrs weston could only approve  isabella then went to emma\\nbut emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being\\nall able to get away and they were still discussing the point\\nwhen mr knightley who had left the room immediately after his\\nbrothers first report of the snow came back again and told them\\nthat he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there\\nnot being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they\\nliked it either now or an hour hence  he had gone beyond the sweep\\nsome way along the highbury roadthe snow was nowhere above half\\nan inch deepin many places hardly enough to whiten the ground\\na very few flakes were falling at present but the clouds were parting\\nand there was every appearance of its being soon over  he had seen\\nthe coachmen and they both agreed with him in there being nothing\\nto apprehend\\n\\nto isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they\\nwere scarcely less acceptable to emma on her fathers account\\nwho was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\nconstitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not\\nbe appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued\\nat randalls  he was satisfied of there being no present danger in\\nreturning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\\nto stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending\\nmr knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences  thus\\n\\nyour father will not be easy why do not you go\\n\\ni am ready if the others are\\n\\nshall i ring the bell\\n\\nyes do\\n\\nand the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for  a few\\nminutes more and emma hoped to see one troublesome companion\\ndeposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other\\nrecover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over\\n\\nthe carriage came  and mr woodhouse always the first object on\\nsuch occasions was carefully attended to his own by mr knightley\\nand mr weston but not all that either could say could prevent some\\nrenewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen\\nand the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for\\nhe was afraid they should have a very bad drive  he was afraid\\npoor isabella would not like it  and there would be poor emma\\nin the carriage behind  he did not know what they had best do\\nthey must keep as much together as they could and james was talked to\\nand given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage\\n\\nisabella stept in after her father john knightley forgetting that he\\ndid not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally\\nso that emma found on being escorted and followed into the second\\ncarriage by mr elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them\\nand that they were to have a teteatete drive  it would not have been\\nthe awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure\\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked\\nto him of harriet and the threequarters of a mile would have\\nseemed but one  but now she would rather it had not happened\\nshe believed he had been drinking too much of mr westons good wine\\nand felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense\\n\\nto restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity\\nof the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had\\nthey passed the sweepgate and joined the other carriage than she\\nfound her subject cut upher hand seizedher attention demanded\\nand mr elton actually making violent love to her  availing himself\\nof the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already\\nwell known hopingfearingadoringready to die if she refused him\\nbut flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled\\nlove and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect\\nand in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon\\nas possible  it really was so  without scruplewithout apology\\nwithout much apparent diffidence mr elton the lover of harriet\\nwas professing himself her lover  she tried to stop him but vainly\\nhe would go on and say it all  angry as she was the thought of\\nthe moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak\\nshe felt that half this folly must be drunkenness and therefore\\ncould hope that it might belong only to the passing hour\\naccordingly with a mixture of the serious and the playful which she\\nhoped would best suit his half and half state she replied\\n\\ni am very much astonished mr elton  this to me you forget yourself\\nyou take me for my friendany message to miss smith i shall\\nbe happy to deliver but no more of this to me if you please\\n\\nmiss smithmessage to miss smithwhat could she possibly mean\\nand he repeated her words with such assurance of accent such boastful\\npretence of amazement that she could not help replying with quickness\\n\\nmr elton this is the most extraordinary conduct and i can account\\nfor it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak\\neither to me or of harriet in such a manner  command yourself\\nenough to say no more and i will endeavour to forget it\\n\\nbut mr elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits\\nnot at all to confuse his intellects  he perfectly knew his own meaning\\nand having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious\\nand slightly touched upon his respect for miss smith as her friend\\nbut acknowledging his wonder that miss smith should be mentioned\\nat allhe resumed the subject of his own passion and was very\\nurgent for a favourable answer\\n\\nas she thought less of his inebriety she thought more of his inconstancy\\nand presumption and with fewer struggles for politeness replied\\n\\nit is impossible for me to doubt any longer  you have made\\nyourself too clear  mr elton my astonishment is much beyond\\nany thing i can express  after such behaviour as i have witnessed\\nduring the last month to miss smithsuch attentions as i\\nhave been in the daily habit of observingto be addressing me\\nin

cried mr elton what can be the meaning of this\\nmiss smithi never thought of miss smith in the whole course\\nof my existencenever paid her any attentions but as your friend\\nnever cared whether she were dead or alive but as your friend\\nif she has fancied otherwise her own wishes have misled her\\nand i am very sorryextremely sorrybut miss smith indeedoh\\nmiss woodhouse who can think of miss smith when miss woodhouse\\nis near  no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character\\ni have thought only of you  i protest against having paid the smallest\\nattention to any one else  every

am sure you have seen\\nand understood me\\n\\nit would be impossible to say what emma felt on hearing this\\nwhich of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost  she was\\ntoo completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply\\nand two moments of silence being ample encouragement for mr eltons\\nsanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he\\njoyously exclaimed\\n\\ncharming miss woodhouse allow me to interpret this interesting silence\\nit confesses that you have long understood me\\n\\nno sir cried emma it confesses no such thing  so far from\\nhaving long understood you i have been in a most complete error\\nwith respect to your views till this moment  as to myself i am\\nvery sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings\\nnothing could be farther from my wishesyour attachment to my\\nfriend harrietyour pursuit of her pursuit it appeared gave me\\ngreat pleasure and i have been very earnestly wishing you success\\nbut had i supposed that she

not\\ni think quite so much at a loss  i need not so totally despair\\nof an equal alliance as to be addressing myself to miss smith\\nno madam my visits to hartfield have been for yourself only\\nand the encouragement i received\\n\\nencouragementi give you encouragementsir you have been entirely\\nmistaken in supposing it  i have seen you only as the admirer\\nof my friend  in no other light could you have been more to me than\\na common acquaintance  i am exceedingly sorry  but it is well that\\nthe mistake ends where it does  had the same behaviour continued\\nmiss smith might have been led into a misconception of your views\\nnot being aware probably any more than myself of the very\\ngreat inequality which you are so sensible of  but as it is\\nthe disappointment is single and i trust will not be lasting\\ni have no thoughts of matrimony at present\\n\\nhe was too angry to say another word her manner too decided\\nto invite supplication and in this state of swelling resentment\\nand mutually deep mortification they had to continue together a few\\nminutes longer for the fears of mr woodhouse had confined them\\nto a footpace if there had not been so much anger there would have\\nbeen desperate awkwardness but their straightforward emotions left\\nno room for the little zigzags of embarrassment  without knowing\\nwhen the carriage turned into vicarage lane or when it stopped\\nthey found themselves all at once at the door of his house\\nand he was out before another syllable passedemma then felt it\\nindispensable to wish him a good night  the

overthrow\\nof every thing she had been wishing forsuch a development of every\\nthing most unwelcomesuch a blow for harrietthat was the worst\\nof all  every part of it brought pain and humiliation of some sort\\nor other but compared with the evil to harriet all was light\\nand she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken\\nmore in errormore disgraced by misjudgment than she actually was\\ncould the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself\\n\\nif i had not persuaded harriet into liking the man i could have\\nborne any thing  he might have doubled his presumption to me\\nbut poor harriet\\n\\nhow she could have been so deceivedhe protested that he\\nhad never thought seriously of harrietnever  she looked back\\nas well as she could but it was all confusion  she had taken\\nup the idea she supposed and made every thing bend to it\\nhis manners however must have been unmarked wavering dubious\\nor she could not have been so misled\\n\\nthe picturehow eager he had been about the picture\\nand the charadeand an hundred other circumstances\\nhow clearly they had seemed to point at harriet  to be sure\\nthe charade with its ready witbut then the soft eyes\\nin fact it suited neither it was a jumble without taste or truth\\nwho could have seen through such thickheaded nonsense\\n\\ncertainly she had often especially of late thought his manners\\nto herself unnecessarily gallant but it had passed as his way\\nas a mere error of judgment of knowledge of taste as one proof\\namong others that he had not always lived in the best society\\nthat with all the gentleness of his address true elegance\\nwas sometimes wanting but till this very day she had never\\nfor an instant suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect\\nto her as harriets friend\\n\\nto mr john knightley was she indebted for her first idea on\\nthe subject for the first start of its possibility  there was\\nno denying that those brothers had penetration  she remembered\\nwhat mr knightley had once said to her about mr elton the caution\\nhe had given the conviction he had professed that mr elton would\\nnever marry indiscreetly and blushed to think how much truer\\na knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she\\nhad reached herself  it was dreadfully mortifying but mr elton\\nwas proving himself in many respects the very reverse of what she\\nhad meant and believed him proud assuming conceited very full\\nof his own claims and little concerned about the feelings of others\\n\\ncontrary to the usual course of things mr eltons wanting\\nto pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion\\nhis professions and his proposals did him no service  she thought\\nnothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes\\nhe wanted to marry well and having the arrogance to raise his\\neyes to her pretended to be in love but she was perfectly easy\\nas to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for\\nthere had been no real affection either in his language or manners\\nsighs and fine words had been given in abundance but she could\\nhardly devise any set of expressions or fancy any tone of voice\\nless allied with real love  she need not trouble herself to pity him\\nhe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse\\nof hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite\\nso easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss\\nsomebody else with twenty or with ten\\n\\nbutthat he should talk of encouragement should consider her as\\naware of his views accepting his attentions meaning in short\\nto marry himshould suppose himself her equal in connexion\\nor mindlook down upon her friend so well understanding the\\ngradations of rank below him and be so blind to what rose above\\nas to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her\\nit was most provoking\\n\\nperhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he\\nwas her inferior in talent and all the elegancies of mind\\nthe very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it\\nbut he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly\\nhis superior  he must know that the woodhouses had been settled\\nfor several generations at hartfield the younger branch\\nof a very ancient familyand that the eltons were nobody\\nthe landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable\\nbeing but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all\\nthe rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources\\nwas such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself\\nin every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long\\nheld a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which\\nmr elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way\\nas he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing\\nto recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility\\nbut he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must\\nhave been his dependence and after raving a little about the\\nseeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head\\nemma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own\\nbehaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of\\ncourtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived\\nmight warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy\\nlike mr elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite  if she\\nhad so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder\\nthat he with selfinterest to blind him should have mistaken hers\\n\\nthe first error and the worst lay at her door  it was foolish\\nit was wrong to take so active a part in bringing any two\\npeople together  it was adventuring too far assuming too much\\nmaking light of what ought to be serious a trick of what ought\\nto be simple  she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved\\nto do such things no more\\n\\nhere have i said she actually talked poor harriet into being\\nvery much attached to this man  she might never have thought of him\\nbut for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope\\nif i had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest\\nand humble as i used to think him  oh that i had been satisfied with\\npersuading her not to accept young martin  there i was quite right\\nthat was well done of me but there i should have stopped and left\\nthe rest to time and chance  i was introducing her into good company\\nand giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having\\ni ought not to have attempted more  but now poor girl her peace\\nis cut up for some time  i have been but half a friend to her\\nand if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much i am\\nsure i have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable\\nfor herwilliam coxeoh no i could not endure william coxe\\na pert young lawyer\\n\\nshe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse and then resumed\\na more serious more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been\\nand might be and must be  the distressing explanation she had\\nto make to harriet and all that poor harriet would be suffering\\nwith the awkwardness of future meetings the difficulties of\\ncontinuing or discontinuing the acquaintance of subduing feelings\\nconcealing resentment and avoiding eclat were enough to occupy\\nher in most unmirthful reflections some time longer and she went\\nto bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having\\nblundered most dreadfully\\n\\nto youth and natural cheerfulness like emmas though under\\ntemporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail\\nto bring return of spirits  the youth and cheerfulness of morning\\nare in happy analogy and of powerful operation and if the\\ndistress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed they\\nwill be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope\\n\\nemma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had\\ngone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her\\nand to depend on getting tolerably out of it\\n\\nit was a great consolation that mr elton should not be really\\nin love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking\\nto disappoint himthat harriets nature should not be of that\\nsuperior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive\\nand that there could be no necessity for any bodys knowing\\nwhat had passed except the three principals and especially\\nfor her fathers being given a moments uneasiness about it\\n\\nthese were very cheering thoughts and the sight of a great deal\\nof snow on the ground did her further service for any thing was\\nwelcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder\\nat present\\n\\nthe weather was most favourable for her though christmas day\\nshe could not go to church  mr woodhouse would have been miserable\\nhad his daughter attempted it and she was therefore safe from\\neither exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas\\nthe ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled\\nstate between frost and thaw which is of all others the most\\nunfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow\\nand every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most\\nhonourable prisoner  no intercourse with harriet possible but by note\\nno church for her on sunday any more than on christmas day and no\\nneed to find excuses for mr eltons absenting himself\\n\\nit was weather which might fairly confine every body at home\\nand though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort\\nin some society or other it was very pleasant to have her father\\nso well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house\\ntoo wise to stir out and to hear him say to mr knightley whom no\\nweather could keep entirely from them\\n\\nah  mr knightley why do not you stay at home like poor mr elton\\n\\nthese days of confinement would have been but for her private\\nperplexities remarkably comfortable as such seclusion exactly\\nsuited her brother whose feelings must always be of great importance\\nto his companions and he had besides so thoroughly cleared off\\nhis illhumour at randalls that his amiableness never failed him\\nduring the rest of his stay at hartfield  he was always agreeable\\nand obliging and speaking pleasantly of every body  but with all\\nthe hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay\\nthere was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation\\nwith harriet as made it impossible for emma to be ever perfectly at ease\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvii\\n\\n\\nmr and mrs john knightley were not detained long at hartfield\\nthe weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move\\nand mr woodhouse having as usual tried to persuade his daughter\\nto stay behind with all her children was obliged to see the whole\\nparty set off and return to his lamentations over the destiny\\nof poor isabellawhich poor isabella passing her life with\\nthose she doated on full of their merits blind to their faults\\nand always innocently busy might have been a model of right\\nfeminine happiness\\n\\nthe evening of the very day on which they went brought a note\\nfrom mr elton to mr woodhouse a long civil ceremonious note\\nto say with mr eltons best compliments that he was proposing\\nto leave highbury the following morning in his way to bath\\nwhere in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends\\nhe had engaged to spend a few weeks and very much regretted\\nthe impossibility he was under from various circumstances of\\nweather and business of taking a personal leave of mr woodhouse\\nof whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense\\nand had mr woodhouse any commands should be happy to attend to them\\n\\nemma was most agreeably surprizedmr eltons absence just\\nat this time was the very thing to be desired  she admired\\nhim for contriving it though not able to give him much credit\\nfor the manner in which it was announced  resentment could not\\nhave been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father\\nfrom which she was so pointedly excluded  she had not even a\\nshare in his opening complimentsher name was not mentioned\\nand there was so striking a change in all this and such an\\nilljudged solemnity of leavetaking in his graceful acknowledgments\\nas she thought at first could not escape her fathers suspicion\\n\\nit did howeverher father was quite taken up with the surprize\\nof so sudden a journey and his fears that mr elton might never get\\nsafely to the end of it and saw nothing extraordinary in his language\\nit was a very useful note for it supplied them with fresh matter\\nfor thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening\\nmr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits\\nto persuade them away with all her usual promptitude\\n\\nshe now resolved to keep harriet no longer in the dark  she had\\nreason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold and it was\\ndesirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting\\nthe better of her other complaint before the gentlemans return\\nshe went to mrs goddards accordingly the very next day to undergo\\nthe necessary penance of communication and a severe one it was\\nshe had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously\\nfeedingto appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred\\nand acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and misjudging in all her\\nideas on one subject all her observations all her convictions\\nall her prophecies for the last six weeks\\n\\nthe confession completely renewed her first shameand the sight\\nof harriets tears made her think that she should never be in charity\\nwith herself again\\n\\nharriet bore the intelligence very wellblaming nobody\\nand in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition\\nand lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular\\nadvantage at that moment to her friend\\n\\nemma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost\\nand all that was amiable all that ought to be attaching\\nseemed on harriets side not her own  harriet did not consider\\nherself as having any thing to complain of  the affection of such\\na man as mr elton would have been too great a distinction\\nshe never could have deserved himand nobody but so partial\\nand kind a friend as miss woodhouse would have thought it possible\\n\\nher tears fell abundantlybut her grief was so truly artless\\nthat no dignity could have made it more respectable in emmas eyes\\nand she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart\\nand understandingreally for the time convinced that harriet was\\nthe superior creature of the twoand that to resemble her would\\nbe more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or\\nintelligence could do\\n\\nit was rather too late in the day to set about being simpleminded\\nand ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution\\nconfirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination\\nall the rest of her life  her second duty now inferior only to her\\nfathers claims was to promote harriets comfort and endeavour\\nto prove her own affection in some better method than by matchmaking\\nshe got her to hartfield and shewed her the most unvarying kindness\\nstriving to occupy and amuse her and by books and conversation\\nto drive mr elton from her thoughts\\n\\ntime she knew must be allowed for this being thoroughly done and she\\ncould suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general\\nand very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to mr elton\\nin particular but it seemed to her reasonable that at harriets age\\nand with the entire extinction of all hope such a progress might be\\nmade towards a state of composure by the time of mr eltons return\\nas to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance\\nwithout any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them\\n\\nharriet did think him all perfection and maintained the nonexistence\\nof any body equal to him in person or goodnessand did in truth\\nprove herself more resolutely in love than emma had foreseen\\nbut yet it appeared to her so natural so inevitable to strive\\nagainst an inclination of that sort unrequited that she could not\\ncomprehend its continuing very long in equal force\\n\\nif mr elton on his return made his own indifference as evident\\nand indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do\\nshe could not imagine harriets persisting to place her happiness\\nin the sight or the recollection of him\\n\\ntheir being fixed so absolutely fixed in the same place was bad\\nfor each for all three  not one of them had the power of removal\\nor of effecting any material change of society  they must encounter\\neach other and make the best of it\\n\\nharriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at\\nmrs goddards mr elton being the adoration of all the teachers\\nand great girls in the school and it must be at hartfield only\\nthat she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling\\nmoderation or repellent truth  where the wound had been given\\nthere must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that\\ntill she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace\\nfor herself\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xviii\\n\\n\\nmr frank churchill did not come  when the time proposed\\ndrew near mrs westons fears were justified in the arrival\\nof a letter of excuse  for the present he could not be spared\\nto his very great mortification and regret but still he looked\\nforward with the hope of coming to randalls at no distant period\\n\\nmrs weston was exceedingly disappointedmuch more disappointed\\nin fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the\\nyoung man had been so much more sober  but a sanguine temper\\nthough for ever expecting more good than occurs does not\\nalways pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression\\nit soon flies over the present failure and begins to hope again\\nfor half an hour mr weston was surprized and sorry but then he\\nbegan to perceive that franks coming two or three months later\\nwould be a much better plan better time of year better weather\\nand that he would be able without any doubt to stay considerably\\nlonger with them than if he had come sooner\\n\\nthese feelings rapidly restored his comfort while mrs weston\\nof a more apprehensive disposition foresaw nothing but a repetition\\nof excuses and delays and after all her concern for what her husband\\nwas to suffer suffered a great deal more herself\\n\\nemma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really\\nabout mr frank churchills not coming except as a disappointment\\nat randalls  the acquaintance at present had no charm for her\\nshe wanted rather to be quiet and out of temptation but still as it\\nwas desirable that she should appear in general like her usual self\\nshe took care to express as much interest in the circumstance\\nand enter as warmly into mr and mrs westons disappointment\\nas might naturally belong to their friendship\\n\\nshe was the first to announce it to mr knightley and exclaimed\\nquite as much as was necessary or being acting a part perhaps\\nrather more at the conduct of the churchills in keeping him away\\nshe then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt of the\\nadvantage of such an addition to their confined society in surry\\nthe pleasure of looking at somebody new the galaday to highbury entire\\nwhich the sight of him would have made and ending with reflections\\non the churchills again found herself directly involved in a\\ndisagreement with mr knightley and to her great amusement\\nperceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her\\nreal opinion and making use of mrs westons arguments against herself\\n\\nthe churchills are very likely in fault said mr knightley\\ncoolly but i dare say he might come if he would\\n\\ni do not know why you should say so  he wishes exceedingly to come\\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him\\n\\ni cannot believe that he has not the power of coming if he made\\na point of it  it is too unlikely for me to believe it without proof\\n\\nhow odd you are  what has mr frank churchill done to make you\\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature\\n\\ni am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature in suspecting\\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions and to care\\nvery little for any thing but his own pleasure from living with\\nthose who have always set him the example of it  it is a great deal\\nmore natural than one could wish that a young man brought up\\nby those who are proud luxurious and selfish should be proud\\nluxurious and selfish too  if frank churchill had wanted to see\\nhis father he would have contrived it between september and january\\na man at his agewhat is hethree or fourandtwentycannot be\\nwithout the means of doing as much as that  it is impossible\\n\\nthats easily said and easily felt by you who have always\\nbeen your own master  you are the worst judge in the world\\nmr knightley of the difficulties of dependence  you do not know\\nwhat it is to have tempers to manage\\n\\nit is not to be conceived that a man of three or fourandtwenty\\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount  he cannot\\nwant moneyhe cannot want leisure  we know on the contrary\\nthat he has so much of both that he is glad to get rid of them at\\nthe idlest haunts in the kingdom  we hear of him for ever at some\\nwateringplace or other  a little while ago he was at weymouth\\nthis proves that he can leave the churchills\\n\\nyes sometimes he can\\n\\nand those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while\\nwhenever there is any temptation of pleasure\\n\\nit is very unfair to judge of any bodys conduct without an\\nintimate knowledge of their situation  nobody who has not been\\nin the interior of a family can say what the difficulties\\nof any individual of that family may be  we ought to be\\nacquainted with enscombe and with mrs churchills temper\\nbefore we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do\\nhe may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others\\n\\nthere is one thing emma which a man can always do if he chuses\\nand that is his duty not by manoeuvring and finessing but by vigour\\nand resolution  it is frank churchills duty to pay this attention\\nto his father  he knows it to be so by his promises and messages\\nbut if he wished to do it it might be done  a man who felt rightly\\nwould say at once simply and resolutely to mrs churchill\\nevery sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make\\nto your convenience but i must go and see my father immediately\\ni know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him\\non the present occasion  i shall therefore set off tomorrow\\nif he would say so to her at once in the tone of decision becoming\\na man there would be no opposition made to his going\\n\\nno said emma laughing but perhaps there might be some made to his\\ncoming back again  such language for a young man entirely dependent\\nto usenobody but you mr knightley would imagine it possible\\nbut you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly\\nopposite to your own  mr frank churchill to be making such\\na speech as that to the uncle and aunt who have brought him up\\nand are to provide for himstanding up in the middle of the room\\ni suppose and speaking as loud as he couldhow can you imagine\\nsuch conduct practicable\\n\\ndepend upon it emma a sensible man would find no difficulty in it\\nhe would feel himself in the right and the declarationmade\\nof course as a man of sense would make it in a proper manner\\nwould do him more good raise him higher fix his interest stronger\\nwith the people he depended on than all that a line of shifts\\nand expedients can ever do  respect would be added to affection\\nthey would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had\\ndone rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know\\nas well as he does as well as all the world must know that he\\nought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting\\ntheir power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better\\nof him for submitting to their whims  respect for right conduct\\nis felt by every body  if he would act in this sort of manner\\non principle consistently regularly their little minds would bend\\nto his\\n\\ni rather doubt that  you are very fond of bending little minds\\nbut where little minds belong to rich people in authority\\ni think they have a knack of swelling out till they are quite as\\nunmanageable as great ones  i can imagine that if you as you are\\nmr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in\\nmr frank churchills situation you would be able to say and do\\njust what you have been recommending for him and it might have\\na very good effect  the churchills might not have a word to say\\nin return but then you would have no habits of early obedience\\nand long observance to break through  to him who has it might\\nnot be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence\\nand set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought\\nhe may have as strong a sense of what would be right as you can have\\nwithout being so equal under particular circumstances to act up\\nto it\\n\\nthen it would not be so strong a sense  if it failed to produce\\nequal exertion it could not be an equal conviction\\n\\noh the difference of situation and habit  i wish you would try\\nto understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel\\nin directly opposing those whom as child and boy he has been\\nlooking up to all his life\\n\\nour amiable young man is a very weak young man if this be the first\\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against\\nthe will of others  it ought to have been a habit with him by\\nthis time of following his duty instead of consulting expediency\\ni can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man\\nas he became rational he ought to have roused himself and shaken off\\nall that was unworthy in their authority  he ought to have opposed\\nthe first attempt on their side to make him slight his father\\nhad he begun as he ought there would have been no difficulty now\\n\\nwe shall never agree about him cried emma but that is\\nnothing extraordinary  i have not the least idea of his being\\na weak young man  i feel sure that he is not  mr weston would\\nnot be blind to folly though in his own son but he is very likely\\nto have a more yielding complying mild disposition than would suit\\nyour notions of mans perfection  i dare say he has and though\\nit may cut him off from some advantages it will secure him many others\\n\\nyes all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move\\nand of leading a life of mere idle pleasure and fancying himself\\nextremely expert in finding excuses for it  he can sit down and\\nwrite a fine flourishing letter full of professions and falsehoods\\nand persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method\\nin the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his fathers\\nhaving any right to complain  his letters disgust me\\n\\nyour feelings are singular  they seem to satisfy every body else\\n\\ni suspect they do not satisfy mrs weston  they hardly can\\nsatisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings  standing in\\na mothers place but without a mothers affection to blind her\\nit is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due\\nand she must doubly feel the omission  had she been a person\\nof consequence herself he would have come i dare say and it would\\nnot have signified whether he did or no  can you think your friend\\nbehindhand in these sort of considerations  do you suppose she\\ndoes not often say all this to herself  no emma your amiable\\nyoung man can be amiable only in french not in english  he may be\\nvery aimable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he\\ncan have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people\\nnothing really amiable about him\\n\\nyou seem determined to think ill of him\\n\\nmenot at all replied mr knightley rather displeased i do\\nnot want to think ill of him  i should be as ready to acknowledge\\nhis merits as any other man but i hear of none except what are\\nmerely personal that he is wellgrown and goodlooking with smooth\\nplausible manners\\n\\nwell if he have nothing else to recommend him he will be a\\ntreasure at highbury  we do not often look upon fine young men\\nwellbred and agreeable  we must not be nice and ask for all\\nthe virtues into the bargain  cannot you imagine mr knightley\\nwhat a sensation his coming will produce  there will be but one subject\\nthroughout the parishes of donwell and highbury but one interest\\none object of curiosity it will be all mr frank churchill\\nwe shall think and speak of nobody else\\n\\nyou will excuse my being so much overpowered if i find him\\nconversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only\\na chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts\\n\\nmy idea of him is that he can adapt his conversation to the taste\\nof every body and has the power as well as the wish of being\\nuniversally agreeable  to you he will talk of farming to me\\nof drawing or music and so on to every body having that general\\ninformation on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead\\nor take the lead just as propriety may require and to speak\\nextremely well on each that is my idea of him\\n\\nand mine said mr knightley warmly is that if he turn out any\\nthing like it he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing\\nwhat at threeandtwenty to be the king of his companythe great man\\nthe practised politician who is to read every bodys character\\nand make every bodys talents conduce to the display of his\\nown superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he\\nmay make all appear like fools compared with himself  my dear emma\\nyour own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came\\nto the point\\n\\ni will say no more about him cried emma you turn every\\nthing to evil  we are both prejudiced you against i for him\\nand we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here\\n\\nprejudiced  i am not prejudiced\\n\\nbut i am very much and without being at all ashamed of it\\nmy love for mr and mrs weston gives me a decided prejudice in\\nhis favour\\n\\nhe is a person i never think of from one months end to another\\nsaid mr knightley with a degree of vexation which made emma\\nimmediately talk of something else though she could not comprehend\\nwhy he should be angry\\n\\nto take a dislike to a young man only because he appeared to be\\nof a different disposition from himself was unworthy the real\\nliberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him\\nfor with all the high opinion of himself which she had often laid\\nto his charge she had never before for a moment supposed it could\\nmake him unjust to the merit of another\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvolume ii\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter i\\n\\n\\nemma and harriet had been walking together one morning and\\nin emmas opinion had been talking enough of mr elton for that day\\nshe could not think that harriets solace or her own sins required more\\nand she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject\\nas they returnedbut it burst out again when she thought she\\nhad succeeded and after speaking some time of what the poor must\\nsuffer in winter and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive\\nmr elton is so good to the poor she found something else must be done\\n\\nthey were just approaching the house where lived mrs and miss bates\\nshe determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers\\nthere was always sufficient reason for such an attention mrs and\\nmiss bates loved to be called on and she knew she was considered\\nby the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her\\nas rather negligent in that respect and as not contributing what she\\nought to the stock of their scanty comforts\\n\\nshe had had many a hint from mr knightley and some from her own heart\\nas to her deficiencybut none were equal to counteract the persuasion\\nof its being very disagreeablea waste of timetiresome women\\nand all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the secondrate\\nand thirdrate of highbury who were calling on them for ever\\nand therefore she seldom went near them  but now she made the sudden\\nresolution of not passing their door without going inobserving\\nas she proposed it to harriet that as well as she could calculate\\nthey were just now quite safe from any letter from jane fairfax\\n\\nthe house belonged to people in business  mrs and miss bates occupied\\nthe drawingroom floor and there in the very moderatesized apartment\\nwhich was every thing to them the visitors were most cordially\\nand even gratefully welcomed the quiet neat old lady who with her\\nknitting was seated in the warmest corner wanting even to give up\\nher place to miss woodhouse and her more active talking daughter\\nalmost ready to overpower them with care and kindness thanks for\\ntheir visit solicitude for their shoes anxious inquiries after\\nmr woodhouses health cheerful communications about her mothers\\nand sweetcake from the beaufetmrs cole had just been there\\njust called in for ten minutes and had been so good as to sit an\\nhour with them and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind\\nas to say she liked it very much and therefore she hoped miss\\nwoodhouse and miss smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too\\n\\nthe mention of the coles was sure to be followed by that of mr elton\\nthere was intimacy between them and mr cole had heard from\\nmr elton since his going away  emma knew what was coming they must\\nhave the letter over again and settle how long he had been gone\\nand how much he was engaged in company and what a favourite he\\nwas wherever he went and how full the master of the ceremonies\\nball had been and she went through it very well with all the\\ninterest and all the commendation that could be requisite and always\\nputting forward to prevent harriets being obliged to say a word\\n\\nthis she had been prepared for when she entered the house\\nbut meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther\\nincommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst\\nall the mistresses and misses of highbury and their cardparties\\nshe had not been prepared to have jane fairfax succeed mr elton\\nbut he was actually hurried off by miss bates she jumped away\\nfrom him at last abruptly to the coles to usher in a letter from\\nher niece\\n\\noh yesmr elton i understandcertainly as to dancing\\nmrs cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at bath was\\nmrs cole was so kind as to sit some time with us talking of jane\\nfor as soon as she came in she began inquiring after her\\njane is so very great a favourite there  whenever she is with us\\nmrs cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough\\nand i must say that jane deserves it as much as any body can\\nand so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you\\ncannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time\\nfor writing and when i immediately said but indeed we have\\nwe had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw\\nany body more surprized  have you upon your honour said she\\nwell that is quite unexpected  do let me hear what she says\\n\\nemmas politeness was at hand directly to say with smiling interest\\n\\nhave you heard from miss fairfax so lately  i am extremely happy\\ni hope she is well\\n\\nthank you  you are so kind replied the happily deceived aunt\\nwhile eagerly hunting for the letteroh here it is  i was sure\\nit could not be far off but i had put my huswife upon it you see\\nwithout being aware and so it was quite hid but i had it in my hand\\nso very lately that i was almost sure it must be on the table\\ni was reading it to mrs cole and since she went away i was\\nreading it again to my mother for it is such a pleasure to her\\na letter from janethat she can never hear it often enough\\nso i knew it could not be far off and here it is only just under\\nmy huswifeand since you are so kind as to wish to hear what\\nshe saysbut first of all i really must in justice to jane\\napologise for her writing so short a letteronly two pages you see\\nhardly twoand in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half\\nmy mother often wonders that i can make it out so well\\nshe often says when the letter is first opened well hetty\\nnow i think you will be put to it to make out all that checkerwork\\ndont you maamand then i tell her i am sure she would contrive\\nto make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her\\nevery word of iti am sure she would pore over it till she had\\nmade out every word  and indeed though my mothers eyes are not\\nso good as they were she can see amazingly well still thank god\\nwith the help of spectacles  it is such a blessing  my mothers\\nare really very good indeed  jane often says when she is here\\ni am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see\\nas you doand so much fine work as you have done tooi only wish\\nmy eyes may last me as well\\n\\nall this spoken extremely fast obliged miss bates to stop for breath\\nand emma said something very civil about the excellence of miss\\nfairfaxs handwriting\\n\\nyou are extremely kind replied miss bates highly gratified\\nyou who are such a judge and write so beautifully yourself\\ni am sure there is nobodys praise that could give us so much pleasure\\nas miss woodhouses my mother does not hear she is a little deaf\\nyou know  maam addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse\\nis so obliging to say about janes handwriting\\n\\nand emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment\\nrepeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it\\nshe was pondering in the meanwhile upon the possibility without seeming\\nvery rude of making her escape from jane fairfaxs letter and had\\nalmost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse\\nwhen miss bates turned to her again and seized her attention\\n\\nmy mothers deafness is very trifling you seejust nothing at all\\nby only raising my voice and saying any thing two or three times over\\nshe is sure to hear but then she is used to my voice  but it is very\\nremarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me\\njane speaks so distinct  however she will not find her grandmama\\nat all deafer than she was two years ago which is saying a great\\ndeal at my mothers time of lifeand it really is full two years\\nyou know since she was here  we never were so long without seeing\\nher before and as i was telling mrs cole we shall hardly know\\nhow to make enough of her now\\n\\nare you expecting miss fairfax here soon\\n\\noh yes next week\\n\\nindeedthat must be a very great pleasure\\n\\nthank you  you are very kind  yes next week  every body is\\nso surprized and every body says the same obliging things  i am\\nsure she will be as happy to see her friends at highbury as they\\ncan be to see her  yes friday or saturday she cannot say which\\nbecause colonel campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one\\nof those days  so very good of them to send her the whole way\\nbut they always do you know  oh yes friday or saturday next\\nthat is what she writes about  that is the reason of her writing out\\nof rule as we call it for in the common course we should not have\\nheard from her before next tuesday or wednesday\\n\\nyes so i imagined  i was afraid there could be little chance\\nof my hearing any thing of miss fairfax today\\n\\nso obliging of you  no we should not have heard if it had not\\nbeen for this particular circumstance of her being to come here\\nso soon  my mother is so delightedfor she is to be three months\\nwith us at least  three months she says so positively as i\\nam going to have the pleasure of reading to you  the case is\\nyou see that the campbells are going to ireland  mrs dixon has\\npersuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly\\nthey had not intended to go over till the summer but she is so\\nimpatient to see them againfor till she married last october\\nshe was never away from them so much as a week which must make\\nit very strange to be in different kingdoms i was going to say\\nbut however different countries and so she wrote a very urgent letter\\nto her motheror her father i declare i do not know which it was\\nbut we shall see presently in janes letterwrote in mr dixons\\nname as well as her own to press their coming over directly\\nand they would give them the meeting in dublin and take them back\\nto their country seat balycraig a beautiful place i fancy\\njane has heard a great deal of its beauty from mr dixon i mean\\ni do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else\\nbut it was very natural you know that he should like to speak\\nof his own place while he was paying his addressesand as jane used\\nto be very often walking out with themfor colonel and mrs campbell\\nwere very particular about their daughters not walking out\\noften with only mr dixon for which i do not at all blame them\\nof course she heard every thing he might be telling miss campbell\\nabout his own home in ireland and i think she wrote us word\\nthat he had shewn them some drawings of the place views that he\\nhad taken himself  he is a most amiable charming young man\\ni believe  jane was quite longing to go to ireland from his account\\nof things\\n\\nat this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering\\nemmas brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr dixon\\nand the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design\\nof farther discovery\\n\\nyou must feel it very fortunate that miss fairfax should be allowed\\nto come to you at such a time  considering the very particular\\nfriendship between her and mrs dixon you could hardly have expected\\nher to be excused from accompanying colonel and mrs campbell\\n\\nvery true very true indeed  the very thing that we have always\\nbeen rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her\\nat such a distance from us for months togethernot able to come\\nif any thing was to happen  but you see every thing turns out\\nfor the best  they want her mr and mrs dixon excessively to\\ncome over with colonel and mrs campbell quite depend upon it\\nnothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation\\njane says as you will hear presently mr dixon does not seem in the\\nleast backward in any attention  he is a most charming young man\\never since the service he rendered jane at weymouth when they were\\nout in that party on the water and she by the sudden whirling\\nround of something or other among the sails would have been dashed\\ninto the sea at once and actually was all but gone if he had not\\nwith the greatest presence of mind caught hold of her habit\\ni can never think of it without tremblingbut ever since we\\nhad the history of that day i have been so fond of mr dixon\\n\\nbut in spite of all her friends urgency and her own wish\\nof seeing ireland miss fairfax prefers devoting the time to you\\nand mrs bates\\n\\nyesentirely her own doing entirely her own choice and colonel\\nand mrs campbell think she does quite right just what they\\nshould recommend and indeed they particularly wish her to try\\nher native air as she has not been quite so well as usual lately\\n\\ni am concerned to hear of it  i think they judge wisely\\nbut mrs dixon must be very much disappointed  mrs dixon\\ni understand has no remarkable degree of personal beauty is not\\nby any means to be compared with miss fairfax\\n\\noh no  you are very obliging to say such thingsbut certainly not\\nthere is no comparison between them  miss campbell always was\\nabsolutely plainbut extremely elegant and amiable\\n\\nyes that of course\\n\\njane caught a bad cold poor thing so long ago as the 7th\\nof november as i am going to read to you and has never been\\nwell since  a long time is not it for a cold to hang upon her\\nshe never mentioned it before because she would not alarm us\\njust like her so consideratebut however she is so far from well\\nthat her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home\\nand try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt\\nthat three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her\\nand it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here\\nthan go to ireland if she is unwell nobody could nurse her as we\\nshould do\\n\\nit appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world\\n\\nand so she is to come to us next friday or saturday and the\\ncampbells leave town in their way to holyhead the monday following\\nas you will find from janes letter  so suddenyou may guess\\ndear miss woodhouse what a flurry it has thrown me in\\nif it was not for the drawback of her illnessbut i am afraid\\nwe must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly\\ni must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me as to that\\ni always make a point of reading janes letters through to myself first\\nbefore i read them aloud to my mother you know for fear of there\\nbeing any thing in them to distress her  jane desired me to do it\\nso i always do  and so i began today with my usual caution\\nbut no sooner did i come to the mention of her being unwell than i\\nburst out quite frightened with bless me poor jane is ill\\nwhich my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly\\nalarmed at  however when i read on i found it was not near so bad\\nas i had fancied at first and i make so light of it now to her\\nthat she does not think much about it  but i cannot imagine\\nhow i could be so off my guard  if jane does not get well soon\\nwe will call in mr perry  the expense shall not be thought of\\nand though he is so liberal and so fond of jane that i dare say\\nhe would not mean to charge any thing for attendance we could not\\nsuffer it to be so you know  he has a wife and family to maintain\\nand is not to be giving away his time  well now i have just given you\\na hint of what jane writes about we will turn to her letter and i am\\nsure she tells her own story a great deal better than i can tell it\\nfor her\\n\\ni am afraid we must be running away said emma glancing at harriet\\nand beginning to risemy father will be expecting us\\ni had no intention i thought i had no power of staying more than\\nfive minutes when i first entered the house  i merely called\\nbecause i would not pass the door without inquiring after mrs bates\\nbut i have been so pleasantly detained  now however we must wish\\nyou and mrs bates good morning\\n\\nand not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded\\nshe regained the streethappy in this that though much had been\\nforced on her against her will though she had in fact heard\\nthe whole substance of jane fairfaxs letter she had been able\\nto escape the letter itself\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ii\\n\\n\\njane fairfax was an orphan the only child of mrs batess\\nyoungest daughter\\n\\nthe marriage of lieut fairfax of the  regiment of infantry\\nand miss jane bates had had its day of fame and pleasure\\nhope and interest but nothing now remained of it save the melancholy\\nremembrance of him dying in action abroadof his widow sinking\\nunder consumption and grief soon afterwardsand this girl\\n\\nby birth she belonged to highbury  and when at three years old\\non losing her mother she became the property the charge\\nthe consolation the fondling of her grandmother and aunt there had\\nseemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there\\nof her being taught only what very limited means could command\\nand growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement\\nto be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person\\ngood understanding and warmhearted wellmeaning relations\\n\\nbut the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave\\na change to her destiny  this was colonel campbell who had\\nvery highly regarded fairfax as an excellent officer and most\\ndeserving young man and farther had been indebted to him for\\nsuch attentions during a severe campfever as he believed had saved\\nhis life  these were claims which he did not learn to overlook\\nthough some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax\\nbefore his own return to england put any thing in his power\\nwhen he did return he sought out the child and took notice of her\\nhe was a married man with only one living child a girl\\nabout janes age  and jane became their guest paying them long visits\\nand growing a favourite with all and before she was nine years old\\nhis daughters great fondness for her and his own wish of being\\na real friend united to produce an offer from colonel campbell\\nof undertaking the whole charge of her education  it was accepted\\nand from that period jane had belonged to colonel campbells family\\nand had lived with them entirely only visiting her grandmother\\nfrom time to time\\n\\nthe plan was that she should be brought up for educating others\\nthe very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father\\nmaking independence impossible  to provide for her otherwise\\nwas out of colonel campbells power for though his income by pay\\nand appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must\\nbe all his daughters but by giving her an education he hoped\\nto be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter\\n\\nsuch was jane fairfaxs history  she had fallen into good hands\\nknown nothing but kindness from the campbells and been given\\nan excellent education  living constantly with rightminded\\nand wellinformed people her heart and understanding had received\\nevery advantage of discipline and culture and colonel campbells\\nresidence being in london every lighter talent had been done\\nfull justice to by the attendance of firstrate masters\\nher disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that\\nfriendship could do and at eighteen or nineteen she was as far\\nas such an early age can be qualified for the care of children\\nfully competent to the office of instruction herself but she\\nwas too much beloved to be parted with  neither father nor mother\\ncould promote and the daughter could not endure it  the evil day\\nwas put off  it was easy to decide that she was still too young\\nand jane remained with them sharing as another daughter in all\\nthe rational pleasures of an elegant society and a judicious\\nmixture of home and amusement with only the drawback of the future\\nthe sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind\\nher that all this might soon be over\\n\\nthe affection of the whole family the warm attachment of miss\\ncampbell in particular was the more honourable to each party\\nfrom the circumstance of janes decided superiority both in beauty\\nand acquirements  that nature had given it in feature could not\\nbe unseen by the young woman nor could her higher powers of mind\\nbe unfelt by the parents  they continued together with unabated\\nregard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance\\nthat luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs\\ngiving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior\\nengaged the affections of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeable\\nalmost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly\\nand happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn\\n\\nthis event had very lately taken place too lately for any thing to be\\nyet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\\nof duty though she had now reached the age which her own judgment\\nhad fixed on for beginning  she had long resolved that oneandtwenty\\nshould be the period  with the fortitude of a devoted novitiate\\nshe had resolved at oneandtwenty to complete the sacrifice\\nand retire from all the pleasures of life of rational intercourse\\nequal society peace and hope to penance and mortification for ever\\n\\nthe good sense of colonel and mrs campbell could not oppose such\\na resolution though their feelings did  as long as they lived\\nno exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever\\nand for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly\\nbut this would be selfishnesswhat must be at last had better\\nbe soon  perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder\\nand wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay and spared\\nher from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must\\nnow be relinquished  still however affection was glad to catch\\nat any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment\\nshe had never been quite well since the time of their daughters marriage\\nand till she should have completely recovered her usual strength\\nthey must forbid her engaging in duties which so far from being\\ncompatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits seemed\\nunder the most favourable circumstances to require something\\nmore than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\\ntolerable comfort\\n\\nwith regard to her not accompanying them to ireland her account\\nto her aunt contained nothing but truth though there might be some\\ntruths not told  it was her own choice to give the time of their\\nabsence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect\\nliberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear\\nand the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives\\nwhether single or double or treble gave the arrangement\\ntheir ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few\\nmonths spent in her native air for the recovery of her health\\nthan on any thing else  certain it was that she was to come\\nand that highbury instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\\nhad been so long promised itmr frank churchillmust put up for\\nthe present with jane fairfax who could bring only the freshness\\nof a two years absence\\n\\nemma was sorryto have to pay civilities to a person she did\\nnot like through three long monthsto be always doing more than\\nshe wished and less than she ought  why she did not like jane\\nfairfax might be a difficult question to answer mr knightley\\nhad once told her it was because she saw in her the really\\naccomplished young woman which she wanted to be thought herself\\nand though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time\\nthere were moments of selfexamination in which her conscience could\\nnot quite acquit her  but she could never get acquainted with her\\nshe did not know how it was but there was such coldness and reserve\\nsuch apparent indifference whether she pleased or notand then\\nher aunt was such an eternal talkerand she was made such a fuss\\nwith by every bodyand it had been always imagined that they were\\nto be so intimatebecause their ages were the same every body had\\nsupposed they must be so fond of each other  these were her reasons\\nshe had no better\\n\\nit was a dislike so little justevery imputed fault was so magnified\\nby fancy that she never saw jane fairfax the first time after any\\nconsiderable absence without feeling that she had injured her\\nand now when the due visit was paid on her arrival after a two years\\ninterval she was particularly struck with the very appearance\\nand manners which for those two whole years she had been depreciating\\njane fairfax was very elegant remarkably elegant and she had\\nherself the highest value for elegance  her height was pretty\\njust such as almost every body would think tall and nobody could\\nthink very tall her figure particularly graceful her size a most\\nbecoming medium between fat and thin though a slight appearance\\nof illhealth seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two\\nemma could not but feel all this and then her faceher features\\nthere was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered\\nit was not regular but it was very pleasing beauty  her eyes\\na deep grey with dark eyelashes and eyebrows had never been denied\\ntheir praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at\\nas wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed\\nno fuller bloom  it was a style of beauty of which elegance\\nwas the reigning character and as such she must in honour\\nby all her principles admire itelegance which whether of person\\nor of mind she saw so little in highbury  there not to be vulgar\\nwas distinction and merit\\n\\nin short she sat during the first visit looking at jane fairfax\\nwith twofold complacency the sense of pleasure and the sense\\nof rendering justice and was determining that she would dislike\\nher no longer  when she took in her history indeed her situation\\nas well as her beauty when she considered what all this elegance\\nwas destined to what she was going to sink from how she was going\\nto live it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion\\nand respect especially if to every wellknown particular entitling\\nher to interest were added the highly probable circumstance\\nof an attachment to mr dixon which she had so naturally started\\nto herself  in that case nothing could be more pitiable\\nor more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on\\nemma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced\\nmr dixons actions from his wife or of any thing mischievous\\nwhich her imagination had suggested at first  if it were love\\nit might be simple single successless love on her side alone\\nshe might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison\\nwhile a sharer of his conversation with her friend and from the best\\nthe purest of motives might now be denying herself this visit\\nto ireland and resolving to divide herself effectually from\\nhim and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty\\n\\nupon the whole emma left her with such softened charitable feelings\\nas made her look around in walking home and lament that highbury\\nafforded no young man worthy of giving her independence\\nnobody that she could wish to scheme about for her\\n\\nthese were charming feelingsbut not lasting  before she had\\ncommitted herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for\\njane fairfax or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices\\nand errors than saying to mr knightley she certainly is handsome\\nshe is better than handsome  jane had spent an evening at hartfield\\nwith her grandmother and aunt and every thing was relapsing much\\ninto its usual state  former provocations reappeared  the aunt\\nwas as tiresome as ever more tiresome because anxiety for her\\nhealth was now added to admiration of her powers and they had to\\nlisten to the description of exactly how little bread and butter\\nshe ate for breakfast and how small a slice of mutton for dinner\\nas well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her\\nmother and herself and janes offences rose again  they had music\\nemma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily\\nfollowed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air\\nof greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\\nsuperior performance  she was besides which was the worst of all\\nso cold so cautious  there was no getting at her real opinion\\nwrapt up in a cloak of politeness she seemed determined\\nto hazard nothing  she was disgustingly was suspiciously reserved\\n\\nif any thing could be more where all was most she was more\\nreserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing\\nshe seemed bent on giving no real insight into mr dixons character\\nor her own value for his company or opinion of the suitableness\\nof the match  it was all general approbation and smoothness\\nnothing delineated or distinguished  it did her no service however\\nher caution was thrown away  emma saw its artifice and returned\\nto her first surmises  there probably was something more to conceal\\nthan her own preference mr dixon perhaps had been very near\\nchanging one friend for the other or been fixed only to miss campbell\\nfor the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds\\n\\nthe like reserve prevailed on other topics  she and mr frank churchill\\nhad been at weymouth at the same time  it was known that they were\\na little acquainted but not a syllable of real information could emma\\nprocure as to what he truly was  was he handsomeshe believed\\nhe was reckoned a very fine young man  was he agreeable\\nhe was generally thought so  did he appear a sensible young man\\na young man of informationat a wateringplace or in a common\\nlondon acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points\\nmanners were all that could be safely judged of under a much longer\\nknowledge than they had yet had of mr churchill  she believed\\nevery body found his manners pleasing  emma could not forgive her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii\\n\\n\\nemma could not forgive herbut as neither provocation nor resentment\\nwere discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had\\nseen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side\\nhe was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on\\nbusiness with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so\\nopenly as he might have done had her father been out of the room\\nbut speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma\\nhe had been used to think her unjust to jane and had now great\\npleasure in marking an improvement\\n\\na very pleasant evening he began as soon as mr woodhouse\\nhad been talked into what was necessary told that he understood\\nand the papers swept awayparticularly pleasant  you and miss\\nfairfax gave us some very good music  i do not know a more\\nluxurious state sir than sitting at ones ease to be entertained\\na whole evening by two such young women sometimes with music\\nand sometimes with conversation  i am sure miss fairfax must\\nhave found the evening pleasant emma  you left nothing undone\\ni was glad you made her play so much for having no instrument\\nat her grandmothers it must have been a real indulgence\\n\\ni am happy you approved said emma smiling but i hope i am\\nnot often deficient in what is due to guests at hartfield\\n\\nno my dear said her father instantly that i am sure you\\nare not  there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are\\nif any thing you are too attentive  the muffin last nightif it\\nhad been handed round once i think it would have been enough\\n\\nno said mr knightley nearly at the same time you are not\\noften deficient not often deficient either in manner or comprehension\\ni think you understand me therefore\\n\\nan arch look expressedi understand you well enough but she\\nsaid only miss fairfax is reserved\\n\\ni always told you she wasa little but you will soon overcome\\nall that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome all that\\nhas its foundation in diffidence  what arises from discretion\\nmust be honoured\\n\\nyou think her diffident  i do not see it\\n\\nmy dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close\\nby her you are not going to tell me i hope that you\\nhad not a pleasant evening\\n\\noh no i was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions\\nand amused to think how little information i obtained\\n\\ni am disappointed was his only answer\\n\\ni hope every body had a pleasant evening said mr woodhouse\\nin his quiet way  i had  once i felt the fire rather too much\\nbut then i moved back my chair a little a very little and it did\\nnot disturb me  miss bates was very chatty and goodhumoured\\nas she always is though she speaks rather too quick  however\\nshe is very agreeable and mrs bates too in a different way\\ni like old friends and miss jane fairfax is a very pretty sort of\\nyoung lady a very pretty and a very wellbehaved young lady indeed\\nshe must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she\\nhad emma\\n\\ntrue sir and emma because she had miss fairfax\\n\\nemma saw his anxiety and wishing to appease it at least for\\nthe present said and with a sincerity which no one could question\\n\\nshe is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep ones eyes from\\ni am always watching her to admire and i do pity her from my heart\\n\\nmr knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared\\nto express and before he could make any reply mr woodhouse\\nwhose thoughts were on the batess said\\n\\nit is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined\\na great pity indeed and i have often wishedbut it is so little one\\ncan venture to dosmall trifling presents of any thing uncommon\\nnow we have killed a porker and emma thinks of sending them\\na loin or a leg it is very small and delicatehartfield pork is\\nnot like any other porkbut still it is porkand my dear emma\\nunless one could be sure of their making it into steaks nicely fried\\nas ours are fried without the smallest grease and not roast it\\nfor no stomach can bear roast porki think we had better send the leg\\ndo not you think so my dear\\n\\nmy dear papa i sent the whole hindquarter i knew you would wish it\\nthere will be the leg to be salted you know which is so very nice\\nand the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like\\n\\nthats right my dear very right  i had not thought of it before\\nbut that is the best way  they must not oversalt the leg and then\\nif it is not oversalted and if it is very thoroughly boiled\\njust as serle boils ours and eaten very moderately of with a\\nboiled turnip and a little carrot or parsnip i do not consider\\nit unwholesome\\n\\nemma said mr knightley presently i have a piece of news for you\\nyou like newsand i heard an article in my way hither that i think\\nwill interest you\\n\\nnews  oh yes i always like news  what is itwhy do you\\nsmile sowhere did you hear itat randalls\\n\\nhe had time only to say\\n\\nno not at randalls i have not been near randalls when the door\\nwas thrown open and miss bates and miss fairfax walked into the room\\nfull of thanks and full of news miss bates knew not which to\\ngive quickest  mr knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment\\nand that not another syllable of communication could rest with him\\n\\noh my dear sir how are you this morning  my dear miss woodhouse\\ni come quite overpowered such a beautiful hindquarter of pork\\nyou are too bountiful  have you heard the news  mr elton is going\\nto be married\\n\\nemma had not had time even to think of mr elton and she was\\nso completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start\\nand a little blush at the sound\\n\\nthere is my newsi thought it would interest you\\nsaid mr knightley with a smile which implied a conviction\\nof some part of what had passed between them\\n\\nbut where could you hear it cried miss bates  where could\\nyou possibly hear it mr knightley  for it is not five minutes\\nsince i received mrs coles noteno it cannot be more than five\\nor at least tenfor i had got my bonnet and spencer on just ready\\nto come outi was only gone down to speak to patty again about\\nthe porkjane was standing in the passagewere not you jane\\nfor my mother was so afraid that we had not any saltingpan\\nlarge enough  so i said i would go down and see and jane said\\nshall i go down instead for i think you have a little cold\\nand patty has been washing the kitchenoh my dear\\nsaid iwell and just then came the note  a miss hawkins\\nthats all i know  a miss hawkins of bath  but mr knightley\\nhow could you possibly have heard it for the very moment mr cole\\ntold mrs cole of it she sat down and wrote to me  a miss hawkins\\n\\ni was with mr cole on business an hour and a half ago\\nhe had just read eltons letter as i was shewn in and handed it\\nto me directly\\n\\nwell that is quitei suppose there never was a piece of news more\\ngenerally interesting  my dear sir you really are too bountiful\\nmy mother desires her very best compliments and regards and a\\nthousand thanks and says you really quite oppress her\\n\\nwe consider our hartfield pork replied mr woodhouseindeed it\\ncertainly is so very superior to all other pork that emma and i\\ncannot have a greater pleasure than\\n\\noh my dear sir as my mother says our friends are only too good\\nto us  if ever there were people who without having great wealth\\nthemselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us\\nwe may well say that our lot is cast in a goodly heritage\\nwell mr knightley and so you actually saw the letter well\\n\\nit was shortmerely to announcebut cheerful exulting of course\\nhere was a sly glance at emma  he had been so fortunate as to\\ni forget the precise wordsone has no business to remember them\\nthe information was as you state that he was going to be married\\nto a miss hawkins  by his style i should imagine it just settled\\n\\nmr elton going to be married said emma as soon as she could speak\\nhe will have every bodys wishes for his happiness\\n\\nhe is very young to settle was mr woodhouses observation\\nhe had better not be in a hurry  he seemed to me very well off\\nas he was  we were always glad to see him at hartfield\\n\\na new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse said miss bates\\njoyfully my mother is so pleasedshe says she cannot\\nbear to have the poor old vicarage without a mistress\\nthis is great news indeed  jane you have never seen\\nmr eltonno wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him\\n\\njanes curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly\\nto occupy her\\n\\nnoi have never seen mr elton she replied starting on this appeal\\nis heis he a tall man\\n\\nwho shall answer that question cried emma  my father would\\nsay yes mr knightley no and miss bates and i that he is\\njust the happy medium  when you have been here a little longer\\nmiss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard\\nof perfection in highbury both in person and mind\\n\\nvery true miss woodhouse so she will  he is the very best\\nyoung manbut my dear jane if you remember i told you yesterday\\nhe was precisely the height of mr perry  miss hawkinsi dare say\\nan excellent young woman  his extreme attention to my mother\\nwanting her to sit in the vicarage pew that she might hear the better\\nfor my mother is a little deaf you knowit is not much but she\\ndoes not hear quite quick  jane says that colonel campbell is a\\nlittle deaf  he fancied bathing might be good for itthe warm bath\\nbut she says it did him no lasting benefit  colonel campbell\\nyou know is quite our angel  and mr dixon seems a very charming\\nyoung man quite worthy of him  it is such a happiness when good\\npeople get togetherand they always do  now here will be mr elton\\nand miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people\\nand the perrysi suppose there never was a happier or a better couple\\nthan mr and mrs perry  i say sir turning to mr woodhouse\\ni think there are few places with such society as highbury\\ni always say we are quite blessed in our neighboursmy dear sir\\nif there is one thing my mother loves better than another it is pork\\na roast loin of pork\\n\\nas to who or what miss hawkins is or how long he has been\\nacquainted with her said emma nothing i suppose can be known\\none feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance  he has been\\ngone only four weeks\\n\\nnobody had any information to give and after a few more wonderings\\nemma said\\n\\nyou are silent miss fairfaxbut i hope you mean to take\\nan interest in this news  you who have been hearing and seeing\\nso much of late on these subjects who must have been so deep\\nin the business on miss campbells accountwe shall not excuse\\nyour being indifferent about mr elton and miss hawkins\\n\\nwhen i have seen mr elton replied jane i dare say i\\nshall be interestedbut i believe it requires that with me\\nand as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression\\nmay be a little worn off\\n\\nyes he has been gone just four weeks as you observe miss woodhouse\\nsaid miss bates four weeks yesterdaya miss hawkinswell i had\\nalways rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts\\nnot that i evermrs cole once whispered to mebut i immediately said\\nno mr elton is a most worthy young manbutin short i do\\nnot think i am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries\\ni do not pretend to it  what is before me i see  at the same time\\nnobody could wonder if mr elton should have aspiredmiss woodhouse\\nlets me chatter on so goodhumouredly she knows i would not\\noffend for the world  how does miss smith do  she seems quite\\nrecovered now  have you heard from mrs john knightley lately\\noh those dear little children  jane do you know i always fancy\\nmr dixon like mr john knightley  i mean in persontall and with\\nthat sort of lookand not very talkative\\n\\nquite wrong my dear aunt there is no likeness at all\\n\\nvery odd but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand\\none takes up a notion and runs away with it  mr dixon you say\\nis not strictly speaking handsome\\n\\nhandsome  oh nofar from itcertainly plain  i told you he\\nwas plain\\n\\nmy dear you said that miss campbell would not allow him to be plain\\nand that you yourself\\n\\noh as for me my judgment is worth nothing  where i have a regard\\ni always think a person welllooking but i gave what i believed\\nthe general opinion when i called him plain\\n\\nwell my dear jane i believe we must be running away\\nthe weather does not look well and grandmama will be uneasy\\nyou are too obliging my dear miss woodhouse but we really must\\ntake leave  this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed\\ni shall just go round by mrs coles but i shall not stop three minutes\\nand jane you had better go home directlyi would not have you\\nout in a showerwe think she is the better for highbury already\\nthank you we do indeed  i shall not attempt calling on mrs goddard\\nfor i really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork\\nwhen we dress the leg it will be another thing  good morning to you\\nmy dear sir  oh  mr knightley is coming too  well that is\\nso veryi am sure if jane is tired you will be so kind as to\\ngive her your armmr elton and miss hawkinsgood morning\\nto you\\n\\nemma alone with her father had half her attention wanted by him\\nwhile he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry\\nand to marry strangers tooand the other half she could give\\nto her own view of the subject  it was to herself an amusing\\nand a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr elton\\ncould not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet\\nharriet must feel itand all that she could hope was by giving\\nthe first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly\\nfrom others  it was now about the time that she was likely to call\\nif she were to meet miss bates in her wayand upon its beginning\\nto rain emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be\\ndetaining her at mrs goddards and that the intelligence would\\nundoubtedly rush upon her without preparation\\n\\nthe shower was heavy but short and it had not been over five minutes\\nwhen in came harriet with just the heated agitated look which\\nhurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give and the\\noh miss woodhouse what do you think has happened which instantly\\nburst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation\\nas the blow was given emma felt that she could not now shew greater\\nkindness than in listening and harriet unchecked ran eagerly\\nthrough what she had to tell  she had set out from mrs goddards\\nhalf an hour agoshe had been afraid it would rainshe had been\\nafraid it would pour down every momentbut she thought she might\\nget to hartfield firstshe had hurried on as fast as possible\\nbut then as she was passing by the house where a young woman\\nwas making up a gown for her she thought she would just step\\nin and see how it went on and though she did not seem to stay\\nhalf a moment there soon after she came out it began to rain\\nand she did not know what to do so she ran on directly as fast\\nas she could and took shelter at fordsfords was the principal\\nwoollendraper linendraper and haberdashers shop united\\nthe shop first in size and fashion in the placeand so\\nthere she had set without an idea of any thing in the world\\nfull ten minutes perhapswhen all of a sudden who should come in\\nto be sure it was so very oddbut they always dealt at fords\\nwho should come in but elizabeth martin and her brother\\ndear miss woodhouse only think  i thought i should have fainted\\ni did not know what to do  i was sitting near the doorelizabeth saw\\nme directly but he did not he was busy with the umbrella\\ni am sure she saw me but she looked away directly and took\\nno notice and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop\\nand i kept sitting near the dooroh dear i was so miserable\\ni am sure i must have been as white as my gown  i could not go away\\nyou know because of the rain but i did so wish myself anywhere\\nin the world but thereoh dear miss woodhousewell at last\\ni fancy he looked round and saw me for instead of going\\non with her buyings they began whispering to one another\\ni am sure they were talking of me and i could not help thinking\\nthat he was persuading her to speak to medo you think he was\\nmiss woodhousefor presently she came forwardcame quite up\\nto me and asked me how i did and seemed ready to shake hands\\nif i would  she did not do any of it in the same way that she used\\ni could see she was altered but however she seemed to try to be\\nvery friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time\\nbut i know no more what i saidi was in such a tremblei remember\\nshe said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost\\ntoo kind  dear miss woodhouse i was absolutely miserable\\nby that time it was beginning to hold up and i was determined\\nthat nothing should stop me from getting awayand thenonly think\\ni found he was coming up towards me tooslowly you know and as\\nif he did not quite know what to do and so he came and spoke\\nand i answeredand i stood for a minute feeling dreadfully\\nyou know one cant tell how and then i took courage and said it\\ndid not rain and i must go and so off i set and i had not got\\nthree yards from the door when he came after me only to say\\nif i was going to hartfield he thought i had much better go round\\nby mr coles stables for i should find the near way quite floated\\nby this rain  oh dear i thought it would have been the death of me\\nso i said i was very much obliged to him  you know i could\\nnot do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round\\nby the stablesi believe i didbut i hardly knew where i was\\nor any thing about it  oh  miss woodhouse i would rather done\\nany thing than have it happen  and yet you know there was a sort\\nof satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly\\nand elizabeth too  oh  miss woodhouse do talk to me and make\\nme comfortable again\\n\\nvery sincerely did emma wish to do so but it was not immediately in\\nher power  she was obliged to stop and think  she was not thoroughly\\ncomfortable herself  the young mans conduct and his sisters\\nseemed the result of real feeling and she could not but pity them\\nas harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture\\nof wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour\\nbut she had believed them to be wellmeaning worthy people before\\nand what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion\\nit was folly to be disturbed by it  of course he must be sorry\\nto lose herthey must be all sorry  ambition as well as love\\nhad probably been mortified  they might all have hoped to rise\\nby harriets acquaintance  and besides what was the value of\\nharriets descriptionso easily pleasedso little discerning\\nwhat signified her praise\\n\\nshe exerted herself and did try to make her comfortable\\nby considering all that had passed as a mere trifle and quite\\nunworthy of being dwelt on\\n\\nit might be distressing for the moment said she but you seem\\nto have behaved extremely well and it is overand may never\\ncan never as a first meeting occur again and therefore you need\\nnot think about it\\n\\nharriet said very true and she would not think about it\\nbut still she talked of itstill she could talk of nothing else\\nand emma at last in order to put the martins out of her head\\nwas obliged to hurry on the news which she had meant to give\\nwith so much tender caution hardly knowing herself whether\\nto rejoice or be angry ashamed or only amused at such a state\\nof mind in poor harrietsuch a conclusion of mr eltons importance\\nwith her\\n\\nmr eltons rights however gradually revived  though she did not\\nfeel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before\\nor an hour before its interest soon increased and before their\\nfirst conversation was over she had talked herself into all the\\nsensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure\\nas to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place\\nthe martins under proper subordination in her fancy\\n\\nemma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting\\nit had been serviceable in deadening the first shock without retaining\\nany influence to alarm  as harriet now lived the martins could\\nnot get at her without seeking her where hitherto they had wanted\\neither the courage or the condescension to seek her for since her\\nrefusal of the brother the sisters never had been at mrs goddards\\nand a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again\\nwith any necessity or even any power of speech\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv\\n\\n\\nhuman nature is so well disposed towards those who are in\\ninteresting situations that a young person who either marries\\nor dies is sure of being kindly spoken of\\n\\na week had not passed since miss hawkinss name was first\\nmentioned in highbury before she was by some means or other\\ndiscovered to have every recommendation of person and mind\\nto be handsome elegant highly accomplished and perfectly amiable\\nand when mr elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects\\nand circulate the fame of her merits there was very little more\\nfor him to do than to tell her christian name and say whose\\nmusic she principally played\\n\\nmr elton returned a very happy man  he had gone away rejected\\nand mortifieddisappointed in a very sanguine hope after a series\\nof what appeared to him strong encouragement and not only losing\\nthe right lady but finding himself debased to the level of a very\\nwrong one  he had gone away deeply offendedhe came back engaged\\nto anotherand to another as superior of course to the first\\nas under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost\\nhe came back gay and selfsatisfied eager and busy caring nothing\\nfor miss woodhouse and defying miss smith\\n\\nthe charming augusta hawkins in addition to all the usual advantages\\nof perfect beauty and merit was in possession of an independent fortune\\nof so many thousands as would always be called ten a point of\\nsome dignity as well as some convenience  the story told well\\nhe had not thrown himself awayhe had gained a woman of 10000 l\\nor thereabouts and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity\\nthe first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by\\ndistinguishing notice the history which he had to give mrs cole\\nof the rise and progress of the affair was so gloriousthe steps\\nso quick from the accidental rencontre to the dinner at mr greens\\nand the party at mrs brownssmiles and blushes rising in importance\\nwith consciousness and agitation richly scatteredthe lady\\nhad been so easily impressedso sweetly disposedhad in short\\nto use a most intelligible phrase been so very ready to have him\\nthat vanity and prudence were equally contented\\n\\nhe had caught both substance and shadowboth fortune and affection\\nand was just the happy man he ought to be talking only of himself\\nand his own concernsexpecting to be congratulatedready to be\\nlaughed atand with cordial fearless smiles now addressing\\nall the young ladies of the place to whom a few weeks ago\\nhe would have been more cautiously gallant\\n\\nthe wedding was no distant event as the parties had only themselves\\nto please and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for\\nand when he set out for bath again there was a general expectation\\nwhich a certain glance of mrs coles did not seem to contradict\\nthat when he next entered highbury he would bring his bride\\n\\nduring his present short stay emma had barely seen him but just\\nenough to feel that the first meeting was over and to give her\\nthe impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique\\nand pretension now spread over his air  she was in fact\\nbeginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing\\nat all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very\\ndisagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance\\na lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind\\nshe would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again\\nshe wished him very well but he gave her pain and his welfare\\ntwenty miles off would administer most satisfaction\\n\\nthe pain of his continued residence in highbury however must certainly\\nbe lessened by his marriage  many vain solicitudes would be prevented\\nmany awkwardnesses smoothed by it  a mrs elton would be an excuse for\\nany change of intercourse former intimacy might sink without remark\\nit would be almost beginning their life of civility again\\n\\nof the lady individually emma thought very little  she was good\\nenough for mr elton no doubt accomplished enough for highbury\\nhandsome enoughto look plain probably by harriets side\\nas to connexion there emma was perfectly easy persuaded\\nthat after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of harriet\\nhe had done nothing  on that article truth seemed attainable\\nwhat she was must be uncertain but who she was might be found out\\nand setting aside the 10000 l it did not appear that she was at\\nall harriets superior  she brought no name no blood no alliance\\nmiss hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a bristol\\nmerchant of course he must be called but as the whole of the\\nprofits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate it was\\nnot unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\\nmoderate also  part of every winter she had been used to spend in bath\\nbut bristol was her home the very heart of bristol for though\\nthe father and mother had died some years ago an uncle remained\\nin the law linenothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded\\nof him than that he was in the law line and with him the daughter\\nhad lived  emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney\\nand too stupid to rise  and all the grandeur of the connexion\\nseemed dependent on the elder sister who was very well married\\nto a gentleman in a great way near bristol who kept two carriages\\nthat was the windup of the history that was the glory of\\nmiss hawkins\\n\\ncould she but have given harriet her feelings about it all\\nshe had talked her into love but alas she was not so easily to be\\ntalked out of it  the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies\\nof harriets mind was not to be talked away  he might be superseded\\nby another he certainly would indeed nothing could be clearer\\neven a robert martin would have been sufficient but nothing else\\nshe feared would cure her  harriet was one of those who\\nhaving once begun would be always in love  and now poor girl\\nshe was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr elton\\nshe was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other  emma saw\\nhim only once but two or three times every day harriet was sure\\njust to meet with him or just to miss him just to hear his voice\\nor see his shoulder just to have something occur to preserve him\\nin her fancy in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture\\nshe was moreover perpetually hearing about him for excepting when\\nat hartfield she was always among those who saw no fault in mr elton\\nand found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns\\nand every report therefore every guessall that had already\\noccurred all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs\\ncomprehending income servants and furniture was continually\\nin agitation around her  her regard was receiving strength by\\ninvariable praise of him and her regrets kept alive and feelings\\nirritated by ceaseless repetitions of miss hawkinss happiness\\nand continual observation of how much he seemed attached\\nhis air as he walked by the housethe very sitting of his hat\\nbeing all in proof of how much he was in love\\n\\nhad it been allowable entertainment had there been no pain\\nto her friend or reproach to herself in the waverings of\\nharriets mind emma would have been amused by its variations\\nsometimes mr elton predominated sometimes the martins and each\\nwas occasionally useful as a check to the other  mr eltons\\nengagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting mr martin\\nthe unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been\\na little put aside by elizabeth martins calling at mrs goddards\\na few days afterwards  harriet had not been at home but a note had\\nbeen prepared and left for her written in the very style to touch\\na small mixture of reproach with a great deal of kindness\\nand till mr elton himself appeared she had been much occupied\\nby it continually pondering over what could be done in return\\nand wishing to do more than she dared to confess  but mr elton\\nin person had driven away all such cares  while he staid\\nthe martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off\\nfor bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned\\njudged it best for her to return elizabeth martins visit\\n\\nhow that visit was to be acknowledgedwhat would be necessary\\nand what might be safest had been a point of some doubtful\\nconsideration  absolute neglect of the mother and sisters\\nwhen invited to come would be ingratitude  it must not be\\nand yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance\\n\\nafter much thinking she could determine on nothing better than harriets\\nreturning the visit but in a way that if they had understanding\\nshould convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance\\nshe meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill\\nwhile she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon\\nas to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\\nrecurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what\\ndegree of intimacy was chosen for the future\\n\\nshe could think of nothing better  and though there was something\\nin it which her own heart could not approvesomething of ingratitude\\nmerely glossed overit must be done or what would become of harriet\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v\\n\\n\\nsmall heart had harriet for visiting  only half an hour before her\\nfriend called for her at mrs goddards her evil stars had led\\nher to the very spot where at that moment a trunk directed to\\nthe rev philip elton whitehart bath was to be seen under the\\noperation of being lifted into the butchers cart which was to\\nconvey it to where the coaches past and every thing in this world\\nexcepting that trunk and the direction was consequently a blank\\n\\nshe went however and when they reached the farm and she was to\\nbe put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led\\nbetween espalier appletrees to the front door the sight of every\\nthing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before\\nwas beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted\\nemma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity\\nwhich determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed\\nquarter of an hour  she went on herself to give that portion\\nof time to an old servant who was married and settled in donwell\\n\\nthe quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again\\nand miss smith receiving her summons was with her without delay\\nand unattended by any alarming young man  she came solitarily\\ndown the gravel walka miss martin just appearing at the door\\nand parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility\\n\\nharriet could not very soon give an intelligible account\\nshe was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her\\nenough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it\\nwas creating  she had seen only mrs martin and the two girls\\nthey had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing\\nbeyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time\\ntill just at last when mrs martins saying all of a sudden\\nthat she thought miss smith was grown had brought on a more\\ninteresting subject and a warmer manner  in that very room\\nshe had been measured last september with her two friends\\nthere were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by\\nthe window  he had done it  they all seemed to remember the day\\nthe hour the party the occasionto feel the same consciousness\\nthe same regretsto be ready to return to the same good understanding\\nand they were just growing again like themselves harriet as emma\\nmust suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy\\nwhen the carriage reappeared and all was over  the style of\\nthe visit and the shortness of it were then felt to be decisive\\nfourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully\\npassed six weeks not six months agoemma could not but picture\\nit all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally\\nharriet must suffer  it was a bad business  she would have given\\na great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins\\nin a higher rank of life  they were so deserving that a little\\nhigher should have been enough  but as it was how could she have\\ndone otherwiseimpossibleshe could not repent  they must\\nbe separated but there was a great deal of pain in the process\\nso much to herself at this time that she soon felt the necessity\\nof a little consolation and resolved on going home by way of randalls\\nto procure it  her mind was quite sick of mr elton and the martins\\nthe refreshment of randalls was absolutely necessary\\n\\nit was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard\\nthat neither master nor mistress was at home they had both\\nbeen out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield\\n\\nthis is too bad cried emma as they turned away  and now we\\nshall just miss them too provokingi do not know when i have been\\nso disappointed  and she leaned back in the corner to indulge\\nher murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both\\nsuch being the commonest process of a not illdisposed mind\\npresently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt\\nby mr and mrs weston who were standing to speak to her\\nthere was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater\\npleasure was conveyed in soundfor mr weston immediately accosted\\nher with\\n\\nhow dye dohow dye dowe have been sitting with your father\\nglad to see him so well  frank comes tomorrowi had a letter\\nthis morningwe see him tomorrow by dinnertime to a certainty\\nhe is at oxford today and he comes for a whole fortnight i knew it would\\nbe so  if he had come at christmas he could not have staid three days\\ni was always glad he did not come at christmas now we are going\\nto have just the right weather for him fine dry settled weather\\nwe shall enjoy him completely every thing has turned out exactly\\nas we could wish\\n\\nthere was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the\\ninfluence of such a happy face as mr westons confirmed as it all\\nwas by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter\\nbut not less to the purpose  to know that she thought his coming\\ncertain was enough to make emma consider it so and sincerely did\\nshe rejoice in their joy  it was a most delightful reanimation\\nof exhausted spirits  the wornout past was sunk in the freshness\\nof what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moments thought\\nshe hoped mr elton would now be talked of no more\\n\\nmr weston gave her the history of the engagements at enscombe\\nwhich allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at\\nhis command as well as the route and the method of his journey\\nand she listened and smiled and congratulated\\n\\ni shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion\\n\\nemma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech\\nfrom his wife\\n\\nwe had better move on mr weston said she we are detaining\\nthe girls\\n\\nwell well i am readyand turning again to emma but you must\\nnot be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my\\naccount you know i dare say he is really nothing extraordinary\\nthough his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very\\ndifferent conviction\\n\\nemma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer\\nin a manner that appropriated nothing\\n\\nthink of me tomorrow my dear emma about four oclock\\nwas mrs westons parting injunction spoken with some anxiety\\nand meant only for her\\n\\nfour oclockdepend upon it he will be here by three was mr westons\\nquick amendment and so ended a most satisfactory meeting\\nemmas spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore\\na different air james and his horses seemed not half so sluggish\\nas before  when she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at\\nleast must soon be coming out and when she turned round to harriet\\nshe saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there\\n\\nwill mr frank churchill pass through bath as well as oxford\\nwas a question however which did not augur much\\n\\nbut neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once\\nand emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come\\nin time\\n\\nthe morning of the interesting day arrived and mrs westons\\nfaithful pupil did not forget either at ten or eleven or twelve\\noclock that she was to think of her at four\\n\\nmy dear dear anxious friendsaid she in mental soliloquy\\nwhile walking downstairs from her own room always overcareful\\nfor every bodys comfort but your own i see you now in all your\\nlittle fidgets going again and again into his room to be sure\\nthat all is right  the clock struck twelve as she passed through\\nthe hall  tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four\\nhours hence and by this time tomorrow perhaps or a little later\\ni may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here\\ni am sure they will bring him soon\\n\\nshe opened the parlour door and saw two gentlemen sitting with\\nher fathermr weston and his son  they had been arrived only\\na few minutes and mr weston had scarcely finished his explanation\\nof franks being a day before his time and her father was yet\\nin the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations when\\nshe appeared to have her share of surprize introduction and pleasure\\n\\nthe frank churchill so long talked of so high in interest\\nwas actually before herhe was presented to her and she did\\nnot think too much had been said in his praise he was a very good\\nlooking young man height air address all were unexceptionable\\nand his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness\\nof his fathers he looked quick and sensible  she felt immediately\\nthat she should like him and there was a wellbred ease of manner\\nand a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending\\nto be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be\\n\\nhe had reached randalls the evening before  she was pleased\\nwith the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan\\nand travel earlier later and quicker that he might gain half\\na day\\n\\ni told you yesterday cried mr weston with exultation i told\\nyou all that he would be here before the time named  i remembered\\nwhat i used to do myself  one cannot creep upon a journey\\none cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the\\npleasure of coming in upon ones friends before the lookout begins\\nis worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs\\n\\nit is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it said the young man\\nthough there are not many houses that i should presume on so far\\nbut in coming home i felt i might do any thing\\n\\nthe word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency\\nemma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable\\nthe conviction was strengthened by what followed  he was very much\\npleased with randalls thought it a most admirably arranged house\\nwould hardly allow it even to be very small admired the situation\\nthe walk to highbury highbury itself hartfield still more\\nand professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest\\nin the country which none but ones own country gives and the\\ngreatest curiosity to visit it  that he should never have been\\nable to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously\\nthrough emmas brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a\\npleasant one and pleasantly handled  his manner had no air of study\\nor exaggeration  he did really look and speak as if in a state of no\\ncommon enjoyment\\n\\ntheir subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance\\non his side were the inquirieswas she a horsewomanpleasant rides\\npleasant walkshad they a large neighbourhoodhighbury perhaps\\nafforded society enoughthere were several very pretty houses\\nin and about itballshad they ballswas it a musical society\\n\\nbut when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance\\nproportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity\\nwhile their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing\\nhis motherinlaw and speaking of her with so much handsome praise\\nso much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she\\nsecured to his father and her very kind reception of himself\\nas was an additional proof of his knowing how to please\\nand of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her\\nhe did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be\\nthoroughly deserved by mrs weston but undoubtedly he could know\\nvery little of the matter  he understood what would be welcome\\nhe could be sure of little else  his fathers marriage he said\\nhad been the wisest measure every friend must rejoice in it\\nand the family from whom he had received such a blessing must\\nbe ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation\\non him\\n\\nhe got as near as he could to thanking her for miss taylors merits\\nwithout seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\\nwas to be rather supposed that miss taylor had formed miss woodhouses\\ncharacter than miss woodhouse miss taylors and at last as if resolved\\nto qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he\\nwound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person\\n\\nelegant agreeable manners i was prepared for said he\\nbut i confess that considering every thing i had not expected\\nmore than a very tolerably welllooking woman of a certain age\\ni did not know that i was to find a pretty young woman in mrs weston\\n\\nyou cannot see too much perfection in mrs weston for my feelings\\nsaid emma were you to guess her to be eighteen i should listen\\nwith pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using\\nsuch words  dont let her imagine that you have spoken of her as\\na pretty young woman\\n\\ni hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it\\nwith a gallant bow that in addressing mrs weston i should\\nunderstand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought\\nextravagant in my terms\\n\\nemma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected\\nfrom their knowing each other which had taken strong possession\\nof her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were\\nto be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance\\nshe must see more of him to understand his ways at present she\\nonly felt they were agreeable\\n\\nshe had no doubt of what mr weston was often thinking about\\nhis quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them\\nwith a happy expression and even when he might have determined not\\nto look she was confident that he was often listening\\n\\nher own fathers perfect exemption from any thought of the kind\\nthe entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration\\nor suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance  happily he\\nwas not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it\\nthough always objecting to every marriage that was arranged\\nhe never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any\\nit seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons\\nunderstanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were\\nproved against them  she blessed the favouring blindness\\nhe could now without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise\\nwithout a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest\\ngive way to all his natural kindhearted civility in solicitous\\ninquiries after mr frank churchills accommodation on his journey\\nthrough the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road and express\\nvery genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped\\ncatching coldwhich however he could not allow him to feel quite\\nassured of himself till after another night\\n\\na reasonable visit paid mr weston began to movehe must be going\\nhe had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands\\nfor mrs weston at fords but he need not hurry any body else\\nhis son too well bred to hear the hint rose immediately also\\nsaying\\n\\nas you are going farther on business sir i will take the\\nopportunity of paying a visit which must be paid some day or other\\nand therefore may as well be paid now  i have the honour of being\\nacquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to emma a lady\\nresiding in or near highbury a family of the name of fairfax\\ni shall have no difficulty i suppose in finding the house\\nthough fairfax i believe is not the proper namei should rather\\nsay barnes or bates  do you know any family of that name\\n\\nto be sure we do cried his father mrs bateswe passed her house\\ni saw miss bates at the window  true true you are acquainted\\nwith miss fairfax i remember you knew her at weymouth and a fine\\ngirl she is  call upon her by all means\\n\\nthere is no necessity for my calling this morning said the\\nyoung man another day would do as well but there was that degree\\nof acquaintance at weymouth which\\n\\noh go today go today do not defer it  what is right to be done\\ncannot be done too soon  and besides i must give you a hint frank\\nany want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided\\nyou saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body\\nshe mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother\\nwho has barely enough to live on  if you do not call early it\\nwill be a slight\\n\\nthe son looked convinced\\n\\ni have heard her speak of the acquaintance said emma she is\\na very elegant young woman\\n\\nhe agreed to it but with so quiet a yes as inclined her almost\\nto doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct\\nsort of elegance for the fashionable world if jane fairfax could\\nbe thought only ordinarily gifted with it\\n\\nif you were never particularly struck by her manners before\\nsaid she i think you will today you will see her to advantage\\nsee her and hear herno i am afraid you will not hear her at all\\nfor she has an aunt who never holds her tongue\\n\\nyou are acquainted with miss jane fairfax sir are you\\nsaid mr woodhouse always the last to make his way in conversation\\nthen give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very\\nagreeable young lady  she is staying here on a visit to her grandmama\\nand aunt very worthy people i have known them all my life\\nthey will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my\\nservants shall go with you to shew you the way\\n\\nmy dear sir upon no account in the world my father can direct me\\n\\nbut your father is not going so far he is only going to the crown\\nquite on the other side of the street and there are a great many houses\\nyou might be very much at a loss and it is a very dirty walk\\nunless you keep on the footpath but my coachman can tell you\\nwhere you had best cross the street\\n\\nmr frank churchill still declined it looking as serious as he could\\nand his father gave his hearty support by calling out my good friend\\nthis is quite unnecessary frank knows a puddle of water when he\\nsees it and as to mrs batess he may get there from the crown\\nin a hop step and jump\\n\\nthey were permitted to go alone and with a cordial nod from one\\nand a graceful bow from the other the two gentlemen took leave\\nemma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance\\nand could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of\\nthe day with full confidence in their comfort\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi\\n\\n\\nthe next morning brought mr frank churchill again  he came with\\nmrs weston to whom and to highbury he seemed to take very cordially\\nhe had been sitting with her it appeared most companionably at home\\ntill her usual hour of exercise and on being desired to chuse\\ntheir walk immediately fixed on highburyhe did not doubt there\\nbeing very pleasant walks in every direction but if left to him\\nhe should always chuse the same  highbury that airy cheerful\\nhappylooking highbury would be his constant attraction\\nhighbury with mrs weston stood for hartfield and she trusted to\\nits bearing the same construction with him  they walked thither directly\\n\\nemma had hardly expected them  for mr weston who had called in\\nfor half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome\\nknew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize\\nto her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together\\narm in arm  she was wanting to see him again and especially\\nto see him in company with mrs weston upon his behaviour to whom\\nher opinion of him was to depend  if he were deficient there\\nnothing should make amends for it  but on seeing them together\\nshe became perfectly satisfied  it was not merely in fine words\\nor hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty nothing could be\\nmore proper or pleasing than his whole manner to hernothing could\\nmore agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and\\nsecuring her affection  and there was time enough for emma to form a\\nreasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning\\nthey were all three walking about together for an hour or two\\nfirst round the shrubberies of hartfield and afterwards in highbury\\nhe was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently\\nfor mr woodhouses ear and when their going farther was resolved on\\nconfessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village\\nand found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma\\ncould have supposed\\n\\nsome of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings\\nhe begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long\\nand which had been the home of his fathers father and on recollecting\\nthat an old woman who had nursed him was still living walked in quest\\nof her cottage from one end of the street to the other and though\\nin some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit\\nthey shewed altogether a goodwill towards highbury in general\\nwhich must be very like a merit to those he was with\\n\\nemma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn\\nit could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily\\nabsenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making\\na parade of insincere professions and that mr knightley certainly\\nhad not done him justice\\n\\ntheir first pause was at the crown inn an inconsiderable house\\nthough the principal one of the sort where a couple of pair of\\nposthorses were kept more for the convenience of the neighbourhood\\nthan from any run on the road and his companions had not expected\\nto be detained by any interest excited there but in passing it they\\ngave the history of the large room visibly added it had been built\\nmany years ago for a ballroom and while the neighbourhood had been\\nin a particularly populous dancing state had been occasionally used\\nas suchbut such brilliant days had long passed away and now the\\nhighest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist\\nclub established among the gentlemen and halfgentlemen of the place\\nhe was immediately interested  its character as a ballroom caught him\\nand instead of passing on he stopt for several minutes at the two\\nsuperior sashed windows which were open to look in and contemplate\\nits capabilities and lament that its original purpose should\\nhave ceased  he saw no fault in the room he would acknowledge\\nnone which they suggested  no it was long enough broad enough\\nhandsome enough  it would hold the very number for comfort\\nthey ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through\\nthe winter  why had not miss woodhouse revived the former good\\nold days of the roomshe who could do any thing in highbury\\nthe want of proper families in the place and the conviction\\nthat none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be\\ntempted to attend were mentioned but he was not satisfied\\nhe could not be persuaded that so many goodlooking houses as he saw\\naround him could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting\\nand even when particulars were given and families described he was\\nstill unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture\\nwould be any thing or that there would be the smallest difficulty\\nin every bodys returning into their proper place the next morning\\nhe argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and emma\\nwas rather surprized to see the constitution of the weston prevail\\nso decidedly against the habits of the churchills  he seemed to have\\nall the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations\\nof his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe\\nof pride indeed there was perhaps scarcely enough his indifference\\nto a confusion of rank bordered too much on inelegance of mind\\nhe could be no judge however of the evil he was holding cheap\\nit was but an effusion of lively spirits\\n\\nat last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the crown\\nand being now almost facing the house where the bateses lodged\\nemma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him\\nif he had paid it\\n\\nyes oh yeshe replied i was just going to mention it\\na very successful visiti saw all the three ladies and felt very\\nmuch obliged to you for your preparatory hint  if the talking aunt\\nhad taken me quite by surprize it must have been the death of me\\nas it was i was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit\\nten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that\\nwas proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home\\nbefore himbut there was no getting away no pause and to my\\nutter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else\\njoined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them\\nvery nearly threequarters of an hour  the good lady had not given me\\nthe possibility of escape before\\n\\nand how did you think miss fairfax looking\\n\\nill very illthat is if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill\\nbut the expression is hardly admissible mrs weston is it\\nladies can never look ill  and seriously miss fairfax is naturally\\nso pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health\\na most deplorable want of complexion\\n\\nemma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of miss\\nfairfaxs complexion  it was certainly never brilliant but she\\nwould not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was\\na softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance\\nto the character of her face  he listened with all due deference\\nacknowledged that he had heard many people say the samebut yet he\\nmust confess that to him nothing could make amends for the want\\nof the fine glow of health  where features were indifferent\\na fine complexion gave beauty to them all and where they were good\\nthe effect wasfortunately he need not attempt to describe what the\\neffect was\\n\\nwell said emma there is no disputing about tasteat least\\nyou admire her except her complexion\\n\\nhe shook his head and laughedi cannot separate miss fairfax\\nand her complexion\\n\\ndid you see her often at weymouth  were you often in the same society\\n\\nat this moment they were approaching fords and he hastily exclaimed\\nha this must be the very shop that every body attends every day\\nof their lives as my father informs me  he comes to highbury himself\\nhe says six days out of the seven and has always business at fords\\nif it be not inconvenient to you pray let us go in that i may prove\\nmyself to belong to the place to be a true citizen of highbury\\ni must buy something at fords it will be taking out my freedom\\ni dare say they sell gloves\\n\\noh yes gloves and every thing  i do admire your patriotism\\nyou will be adored in highbury  you were very popular before you came\\nbecause you were mr westons sonbut lay out half a guinea at\\nfords and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues\\n\\nthey went in and while the sleek welltied parcels of mens beavers\\nand york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter\\nhe saidbut i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking\\nto me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst\\nof my amor patriae  do not let me lose it  i assure you the utmost\\nstretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any\\nhappiness in private life\\n\\ni merely asked whether you had known much of miss fairfax\\nand her party at weymouth\\n\\nand now that i understand your question i must pronounce it to be a\\nvery unfair one  it is always the ladys right to decide on the degree\\nof acquaintance  miss fairfax must already have given her account\\ni shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow\\n\\nupon my word you answer as discreetly as she could do herself\\nbut her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed\\nshe is so very reserved so very unwilling to give the least\\ninformation about any body that i really think you may say what you\\nlike of your acquaintance with her\\n\\nmay i indeedthen i will speak the truth and nothing suits me\\nso well  i met her frequently at weymouth  i had known the campbells\\na little in town and at weymouth we were very much in the same set\\ncolonel campbell is a very agreeable man and mrs campbell a friendly\\nwarmhearted woman  i like them all\\n\\nyou know miss fairfaxs situation in life i conclude what she\\nis destined to be\\n\\nyesrather hesitatinglyi believe i do\\n\\nyou get upon delicate subjects emma said mrs weston smiling\\nremember that i am heremr frank churchill hardly knows\\nwhat to say when you speak of miss fairfaxs situation in life\\ni will move a little farther off\\n\\ni certainly do forget to think of her said emma as having ever\\nbeen any thing but my friend and my dearest friend\\n\\nhe looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment\\n\\nwhen the gloves were bought and they had quitted the shop again\\ndid you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of play\\nsaid frank churchill\\n\\never hear her repeated emma  you forget how much she belongs\\nto highbury  i have heard her every year of our lives since we\\nboth began  she plays charmingly\\n\\nyou think so do youi wanted the opinion of some one who\\ncould really judge  she appeared to me to play well that is\\nwith considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself\\ni am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill\\nor right of judging of any bodys performancei have been used\\nto hear hers admired and i remember one proof of her being\\nthought to play wella man a very musical man and in love\\nwith another womanengaged to heron the point of marriage\\nwould yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument\\nif the lady in question could sit down insteadnever seemed\\nto like to hear one if he could hear the other  that i thought\\nin a man of known musical talent was some proof\\n\\nproof indeed said emma highly amusedmr dixon is very musical\\nis he  we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you\\nthan miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year\\n\\nyes mr dixon and miss campbell were the persons and i thought\\nit a very strong proof\\n\\ncertainlyvery strong it was to own the truth a great deal\\nstronger than if i had been miss campbell would have been at all\\nagreeable to me  i could not excuse a mans having more music\\nthan lovemore ear than eyea more acute sensibility to fine\\nsounds than to my feelings  how did miss campbell appear to like it\\n\\nit was her very particular friend you know\\n\\npoor comfort said emma laughing  one would rather have a stranger\\npreferred than ones very particular friendwith a stranger it might\\nnot recur againbut the misery of having a very particular friend\\nalways at hand to do every thing better than one does oneself\\npoor mrs dixon  well i am glad she is gone to settle in ireland\\n\\nyou are right  it was not very flattering to miss campbell\\nbut she really did not seem to feel it\\n\\nso much the betteror so much the worsei do not know which\\nbut be it sweetness or be it stupidity in herquickness of friendship\\nor dulness of feelingthere was one person i think who must have\\nfelt it  miss fairfax herself  she must have felt the improper\\nand dangerous distinction\\n\\nas to thati do not\\n\\noh do not imagine that i expect an account of miss fairfaxs\\nsensations from you or from any body else  they are known to no\\nhuman being i guess but herself  but if she continued to play\\nwhenever she was asked by mr dixon one may guess what one chuses\\n\\nthere appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all\\nhe began rather quickly but checking himself added however it\\nis impossible for me to say on what terms they really were\\nhow it might all be behind the scenes  i can only say that there\\nwas smoothness outwardly  but you who have known miss fairfax from\\na child must be a better judge of her character and of how she\\nis likely to conduct herself in critical situations than i can be\\n\\ni have known her from a child undoubtedly we have been children\\nand women together and it is natural to suppose that we should\\nbe intimatethat we should have taken to each other whenever\\nshe visited her friends  but we never did  i hardly know how it\\nhas happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side\\nwhich was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized\\nand so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother\\nand all their set  and then her reservei never could attach\\nmyself to any one so completely reserved\\n\\nit is a most repulsive quality indeed said he  oftentimes\\nvery convenient no doubt but never pleasing  there is safety\\nin reserve but no attraction  one cannot love a reserved person\\n\\nnot till the reserve ceases towards oneself and then the attraction\\nmay be the greater  but i must be more in want of a friend\\nor an agreeable companion than i have yet been to take\\nthe trouble of conquering any bodys reserve to procure one\\nintimacy between miss fairfax and me is quite out of the question\\ni have no reason to think ill of hernot the leastexcept that\\nsuch extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner\\nsuch a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body is apt\\nto suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal\\n\\nhe perfectly agreed with her  and after walking together so long\\nand thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him\\nthat she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting\\nhe was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the\\nworld in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune\\ntherefore better than she had expected  his ideas seemed more moderate\\nhis feelings warmer  she was particularly struck by his manner\\nof considering mr eltons house which as well as the church\\nhe would go and look at and would not join them in finding much\\nfault with  no he could not believe it a bad house not such a house\\nas a man was to be pitied for having  if it were to be shared with\\nthe woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having\\nthat house  there must be ample room in it for every real comfort\\nthe man must be a blockhead who wanted more\\n\\nmrs weston laughed and said he did not know what he was talking about\\nused only to a large house himself and without ever thinking how many\\nadvantages and accommodations were attached to its size he could\\nbe no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one\\nbut emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he\\nwas talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination\\nto settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives\\nhe might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be\\noccasioned by no housekeepers room or a bad butlers pantry\\nbut no doubt he did perfectly feel that enscombe could not make\\nhim happy and that whenever he were attached he would willingly\\ngive up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii\\n\\n\\nemmas very good opinion of frank churchill was a little shaken\\nthe following day by hearing that he was gone off to london\\nmerely to have his hair cut  a sudden freak seemed to have seized him\\nat breakfast and he had sent for a chaise and set off intending to\\nreturn to dinner but with no more important view that appeared than\\nhaving his hair cut  there was certainly no harm in his travelling\\nsixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air\\nof foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve  it did\\nnot accord with the rationality of plan the moderation in expense\\nor even the unselfish warmth of heart which she had believed herself\\nto discern in him yesterday  vanity extravagance love of change\\nrestlessness of temper which must be doing something good or bad\\nheedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and mrs weston\\nindifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general he became\\nliable to all these charges  his father only called him a coxcomb\\nand thought it a very good story but that mrs weston did not like it\\nwas clear enough by her passing it over as quickly as possible\\nand making no other comment than that all young people would have\\ntheir little whims\\n\\nwith the exception of this little blot emma found that his visit\\nhitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him  mrs weston\\nwas very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he\\nmade himselfhow much she saw to like in his disposition altogether\\nhe appeared to have a very open tempercertainly a very cheerful\\nand lively one she could observe nothing wrong in his notions\\na great deal decidedly right he spoke of his uncle with warm regard\\nwas fond of talking of himsaid he would be the best man in the\\nworld if he were left to himself and though there was no being\\nattached to the aunt he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude\\nand seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect\\nthis was all very promising and but for such an unfortunate fancy\\nfor having his hair cut there was nothing to denote him unworthy\\nof the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him\\nthe honour if not of being really in love with her of being\\nat least very near it and saved only by her own indifference\\nfor still her resolution held of never marryingthe honour in short\\nof being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance\\n\\nmr weston on his side added a virtue to the account which must\\nhave some weight  he gave her to understand that frank admired\\nher extremelythought her very beautiful and very charming\\nand with so much to be said for him altogether she found she must\\nnot judge him harshly  as mrs weston observed all young people\\nwould have their little whims\\n\\nthere was one person among his new acquaintance in surry not so\\nleniently disposed  in general he was judged throughout the parishes\\nof donwell and highbury with great candour liberal allowances\\nwere made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man\\none who smiled so often and bowed so well but there was one spirit\\namong them not to be softened from its power of censure by bows\\nor smilesmr knightley  the circumstance was told him at hartfield\\nfor the moment he was silent but emma heard him almost immediately\\nafterwards say to himself over a newspaper he held in his hand\\nhum just the trifling silly fellow i took him for  she had\\nhalf a mind to resent but an instants observation convinced\\nher that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings\\nand not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass\\n\\nalthough in one instance the bearers of not good tidings\\nmr and mrs westons visit this morning was in another respect\\nparticularly opportune  something occurred while they were\\nat hartfield to make emma want their advice and which was\\nstill more lucky she wanted exactly the advice they gave\\n\\nthis was the occurrencethe coles had been settled some years\\nin highbury and were very good sort of peoplefriendly liberal\\nand unpretending but on the other hand they were of low origin\\nin trade and only moderately genteel  on their first coming into\\nthe country they had lived in proportion to their income quietly\\nkeeping little company and that little unexpensively but the last\\nyear or two had brought them a considerable increase of means\\nthe house in town had yielded greater profits

servants\\nto their expenses of every sort and by this time were in fortune\\nand style of living second only to the family at hartfield\\ntheir love of society and their new diningroom prepared every body\\nfor their keeping dinnercompany and a few parties chiefly among\\nthe single men had already taken place  the regular and best\\nfamilies emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite\\nneither donwell nor hartfield nor randalls  nothing should\\ntempt her to go if they did and she regretted that her fathers\\nknown habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she\\ncould wish  the coles were very respectable in their way but they\\nought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms\\non which the superior families would visit them  this lesson\\nshe very much feared they would receive only from herself\\nshe had little hope of mr knightley none of mr weston\\n\\nbut she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many\\nweeks before it appeared that when the insult came at last\\nit found her very differently affected  donwell and randalls\\nhad received their invitation and none had come for her father\\nand herself and mrs westons accounting for it with i suppose\\nthey will not take the liberty with you they know you do not\\ndine out was not quite sufficient  she felt that she should\\nlike to have had the power of refusal and afterwards as the idea\\nof the party to be assembled there consisting precisely of those\\nwhose society was dearest to her occurred again and again\\nshe did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept\\nharriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses  they had\\nbeen speaking of it as they walked about highbury the day before\\nand frank churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence\\nmight not the evening end in a dance had been a question of his\\nthe bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits\\nand her being left in solitary grandeur even supposing the omission\\nto be intended as a compliment was but poor comfort\\n\\nit was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were\\nat hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her\\nfirst remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined\\nshe so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do\\nthat their advice for her going was most prompt and successful\\n\\nshe owned that considering every thing she was not absolutely\\nwithout inclination for the party  the coles expressed themselves\\nso properlythere was so much real attention in the manner of it\\nso much consideration for her father  they would have solicited the\\nhonour earlier but had been waiting the arrival of a foldingscreen\\nfrom london which they hoped might keep mr woodhouse from any draught\\nof air and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the\\nhonour of his company  upon the whole she was very persuadable\\nand it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be\\ndone without neglecting his comforthow certainly mrs goddard\\nif not mrs bates might be depended on for bearing him company\\nmr woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughters\\ngoing out to dinner on a day now near at hand and spending\\nthe whole evening away from him  as for his going emma did\\nnot wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late\\nand the party too numerous  he was soon pretty well resigned\\n\\ni am not fond of dinnervisiting said hei never was\\nno more is emma  late hours do not agree with us  i am sorry\\nmr and mrs cole should have done it  i think it would be\\nmuch better if they would come in one afternoon next summer\\nand take their tea with ustake us in their afternoon walk\\nwhich they might do as our hours are so reasonable and yet get home\\nwithout being out in the damp of the evening  the dews of a summer\\nevening are what i would not expose any body to  however as they\\nare so very desirous to have dear emma dine with them and as you\\nwill both be there and mr knightley too to take care of her\\ni cannot wish to prevent it provided the weather be what it ought\\nneither damp nor cold nor windy  then turning to mrs weston\\nwith a look of gentle reproachah  miss taylor if you had\\nnot married you would have staid at home with me\\n\\nwell sir cried mr weston as i took miss taylor away\\nit is incumbent on me to supply her place if i can and i will\\nstep to mrs goddard in a moment if you wish it\\n\\nbut the idea of any thing to be done in a moment was increasing\\nnot lessening mr woodhouses agitation  the ladies knew better\\nhow to allay it  mr weston must be quiet and every thing\\ndeliberately arranged\\n\\nwith this treatment mr woodhouse was soon composed enough\\nfor talking as usual  he should be happy to see mrs goddard\\nhe had a great regard for mrs goddard and emma should write a line\\nand invite her  james could take the note  but first of all\\nthere must be an answer written to mrs cole\\n\\nyou will make my excuses my dear as civilly as possible  you will\\nsay that i am quite an invalid and go no where and therefore must\\ndecline their obliging invitation beginning with my compliments\\nof course  but you will do every thing right  i need not tell you\\nwhat is to be done  we must remember to let james know that the carriage\\nwill be wanted on tuesday  i shall have no fears for you with him\\nwe have never been there above once since the new approach was made\\nbut still i have no doubt that james will take you very safely\\nand when you get there you must tell him at what time you would\\nhave him come for you again and you had better name an early hour\\nyou will not like staying late  you will get very tired when tea\\nis over\\n\\nbut you would not wish me to come away before i am tired papa\\n\\noh no my love but you will soon be tired  there will be\\na great many people talking at once  you will not like the noise\\n\\nbut my dear sir cried mr weston if emma comes away early\\nit will be breaking up the party\\n\\nand no great harm if it does said mr woodhouse  the sooner\\nevery party breaks up the better\\n\\nbut you do not consider how it may appear to the coles\\nemmas going away directly after tea might be giving offence\\nthey are goodnatured people and think little of their own claims\\nbut still they must feel that any bodys hurrying away is no\\ngreat compliment and miss woodhouses doing it would be more thought\\nof than any other persons in the room  you would not wish to disappoint\\nand mortify the coles i am sure sir friendly good sort of people\\nas ever lived and who have been your neighbours these ten years\\n\\nno upon no account in the world mr weston i am much obliged\\nto you for reminding me  i should be extremely sorry to be giving\\nthem any pain  i know what worthy people they are  perry tells\\nme that mr cole never touches malt liquor  you would not think\\nit to look at him but he is biliousmr cole is very bilious\\nno i would not be the means of giving them any pain  my dear emma\\nwe must consider this  i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting\\nmr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish\\nyou will not regard being tired  you will be perfectly safe\\nyou know among your friends\\n\\noh yes papa  i have no fears at all for myself and i should have\\nno scruples of staying as late as mrs weston but on your account\\ni am only afraid of your sitting up for me  i am not afraid\\nof your not being exceedingly comfortable with mrs goddard\\nshe loves piquet you know but when she is gone home i am afraid\\nyou will be sitting up by yourself instead of going to bed at your\\nusual timeand the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort\\nyou must promise me not to sit up\\n\\nhe did on the condition of some promises on her side  such as that\\nif she came home cold she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly\\nif hungry that she would take something to eat that her own maid\\nshould sit up for her and that serle and the butler should see\\nthat every thing were safe in the house as usual\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii\\n\\n\\nfrank churchill came back again and if he kept his fathers\\ndinner waiting it was not known at hartfield for mrs weston\\nwas too anxious for his being a favourite with mr woodhouse\\nto betray any imperfection which could be concealed\\n\\nhe came back had had his hair cut and laughed at himself with\\na very good grace but without seeming really at all ashamed\\nof what he had done  he had no reason to wish his hair longer\\nto conceal any confusion of face no reason to wish the money unspent\\nto improve his spirits  he was quite as undaunted and as lively\\nas ever and after seeing him emma thus moralised to herself\\n\\ni do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things\\ndo cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an\\nimpudent way  wickedness is always wickedness but folly is not\\nalways follyit depends upon the character of those who handle it\\nmr knightley he is not a trifling silly young man  if he were\\nhe would have done this differently  he would either have gloried\\nin the achievement or been ashamed of it  there would have been\\neither the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too\\nweak to defend its own vanitiesno i am perfectly sure that he\\nis not trifling or silly\\n\\nwith tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again\\nand for a longer time than hitherto of judging of his general manners\\nand by inference of the meaning of his manners towards herself\\nof guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness\\ninto her air and of fancying what the observations of all those\\nmight be who were now seeing them together for the first time\\n\\nshe meant to be very happy in spite of the scene being laid at\\nmr coles and without being able to forget that among the failings\\nof mr elton even in the days of his favour none had disturbed\\nher more than his propensity to dine with mr cole\\n\\nher fathers comfort was amply secured mrs bates as well as\\nmrs goddard being able to come and her last pleasing duty\\nbefore she left the house was to pay her respects to them as\\nthey sat together after dinner and while her father was fondly\\nnoticing the beauty of her dress to make the two ladies all\\nthe amends in her power by helping them to large slices of cake\\nand full glasses of wine for whatever unwilling selfdenial his\\ncare of their constitution might have obliged them to practise\\nduring the mealshe had provided a plentiful dinner for them\\nshe wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it\\n\\nshe followed another carriage to mr coles door and was pleased\\nto see that it was mr knightleys for mr knightley keeping\\nno horses having little spare money and a great deal of health\\nactivity and independence was too apt in emmas opinion to get\\nabout as he could and not use his carriage so often as became\\nthe owner of donwell abbey  she had an opportunity now of speaking\\nher approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out\\n\\nthis is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman\\ni am quite glad to see you\\n\\nhe thanked her observing how lucky that we should arrive at the same\\nmoment for if we had met first in the drawingroom i doubt whether\\nyou would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual\\nyou might not have distinguished how i came by my look or manner\\n\\nyes i should i am sure i should  there is always a look of\\nconsciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know\\nto be beneath them  you think you carry it off very well i dare say\\nbut with you it is a sort of bravado an air of affected unconcern\\ni always observe it whenever i meet you under those circumstances\\nnow you have nothing to try for  you are not afraid of being\\nsupposed ashamed  you are not striving to look taller than any\\nbody else  now i shall really be very happy to walk into the same\\nroom with you\\n\\nnonsensical girl was his reply but not at all in anger\\n\\nemma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party\\nas with mr knightley  she was received with a cordial respect\\nwhich could not but please and given all the consequence she could\\nwish for  when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love\\nthe strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife\\nthe son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked\\nher as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated\\nby herand as she firmly believed not without some dexterity\\non his side\\n\\nthe party was rather large as it included one other family a proper\\nunobjectionable country family whom the coles had the advantage of\\nnaming among their acquaintance and the male part of mr coxs family\\nthe lawyer of highbury  the less worthy females were to come\\nin the evening with miss bates miss fairfax and miss smith\\nbut already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject\\nof conversation to be general and while politics and mr elton\\nwere talked over emma could fairly surrender all her attention to\\nthe pleasantness of her neighbour  the first remote sound to which\\nshe felt herself obliged to attend was the name of jane fairfax\\nmrs cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be\\nvery interesting  she listened and found it well worth listening to\\nthat very dear part of emma her fancy received an amusing supply\\nmrs cole was telling that she had been calling on miss bates\\nand as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight\\nof a pianofortea very elegant looking instrumentnot a grand\\nbut a largesized square pianoforte and the substance of the story\\nthe end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize and inquiry\\nand congratulations on her side and explanations on miss batess was\\nthat this pianoforte had arrived from broadwoods the day before\\nto the great astonishment of both aunt and nieceentirely unexpected\\nthat at first by miss batess account jane herself was quite at\\na loss quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it\\nbut now they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only\\none quarterof course it must be from colonel campbell\\n\\none can suppose nothing else added mrs cole and i was only\\nsurprized that there could ever have been a doubt  but jane\\nit seems had a letter from them very lately and not a word was said\\nabout it  she knows their ways best but i should not consider their\\nsilence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present\\nthey might chuse to surprize her\\n\\nmrs cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the\\nsubject was equally convinced that it must come from colonel campbell\\nand equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there\\nwere enough ready to speak to allow emma to think her own way\\nand still listen to mrs cole\\n\\ni declare i do not know when i have heard any thing that has given\\nme more satisfactionit always has quite hurt me that jane fairfax\\nwho plays so delightfully should not have an instrument\\nit seemed quite a shame especially considering how many houses\\nthere are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away\\nthis is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure and it was\\nbut yesterday i was telling mr cole i really was ashamed\\nto look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawingroom while i\\ndo not know one note from another and our little girls who are\\nbut just beginning perhaps may never make any thing of it\\nand there is poor jane fairfax who is mistress of music has not\\nany thing of the nature of an instrument not even the pitifullest\\nold spinet in the world to amuse herself withi was saying this\\nto mr cole but yesterday and he quite agreed with me only he\\nis so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging\\nhimself in the purchase hoping that some of our good neighbours might\\nbe so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can\\nand that really is the reason why the instrument was bought\\nor else i am sure we ought to be ashamed of itwe are in great\\nhopes that miss woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening\\n\\nmiss woodhouse made the proper acquiescence and finding that nothing\\nmore was to be entrapped from any communication of mrs coles\\nturned to frank churchill\\n\\nwhy do you smile said she\\n\\nnay why do you\\n\\nmei suppose i smile for pleasure at colonel campbells being\\nso rich and so liberalit is a handsome present\\n\\nvery\\n\\ni rather wonder that it was never made before\\n\\nperhaps miss fairfax has never been staying here so long before\\n\\nor that he did not give her the use of their own instrument\\nwhich must now be shut up in london untouched by any body\\n\\nthat is a grand pianoforte and he might think it too large\\nfor mrs batess house\\n\\nyou may say what you chusebut your countenance testifies\\nthat your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine\\n\\ni do not know  i rather believe you are giving me more credit for\\nacuteness than i deserve  i smile because you smile and shall probably\\nsuspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what\\nthere is to question  if colonel campbell is not the person who can be\\n\\nwhat do you say to mrs dixon\\n\\nmrs dixon very true indeed  i had not thought of mrs dixon\\nshe must know as well as her father how acceptable an instrument\\nwould be and perhaps the mode of it the mystery the surprize\\nis more like a young womans scheme than an elderly mans it\\nis mrs dixon i dare say  i told you that your suspicions would\\nguide mine\\n\\nif so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend mr dixon\\nin them\\n\\nmr dixonvery well  yes i immediately perceive that it must\\nbe the joint present of mr and mrs dixon  we were speaking the\\nother day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance\\n\\nyes and what you told me on that head confirmed an idea which i\\nhad entertained beforei do not mean to reflect upon the good\\nintentions of either mr dixon or miss fairfax but i cannot help\\nsuspecting either that after making his proposals to her friend\\nhe had the misfortune to fall in love with her or that he became\\nconscious of a little attachment on her side  one might guess\\ntwenty things without guessing exactly the right but i am sure\\nthere must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to highbury\\ninstead of going with the campbells to ireland  here she must be\\nleading a life of privation and penance there it would have been\\nall enjoyment  as to the pretence of trying her native air i look\\nupon that as a mere excusein the summer it might have passed\\nbut what can any bodys native air do for them in the months\\nof january february and march  good fires and carriages would\\nbe much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i\\ndare say in hers i do not require you to adopt all my suspicions\\nthough you make so noble a profession of doing it but i honestly\\ntell you what they are\\n\\nand upon my word they have an air of great probability\\nmr dixons preference of her music to her friends i can answer\\nfor being very decided\\n\\nand then he saved her life  did you ever hear of that\\na water party and by some accident she was falling overboard\\nhe caught her\\n\\nhe did  i was thereone of the party\\n\\nwere you reallywellbut you observed nothing of course\\nfor it seems to be a new idea to youif i had been there i think\\ni should have made some discoveries\\n\\ni dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact\\nthat miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon\\ncaught herit was the work of a moment  and though the consequent\\nshock and alarm was very great and much more durableindeed i\\nbelieve it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again\\nyet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar\\nanxiety to be observable  i do not mean to say however that you\\nmight not have made discoveries\\n\\nthe conversation was here interrupted  they were called on to share\\nin the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses\\nand obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when\\nthe table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed\\nexactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored\\nemma said\\n\\nthe arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me  i wanted to know\\na little more and this tells me quite enough  depend upon it\\nwe shall soon hear that it is a present from mr and mrs dixon\\n\\nand if the dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we\\nmust conclude it to come from the campbells\\n\\nno i am sure it is not from the campbells  miss fairfax knows it\\nis not from the campbells or they would have been guessed at first\\nshe would not have been puzzled had she dared fix on them\\ni may not have convinced you perhaps but i am perfectly convinced\\nmyself that mr dixon is a principal in the business\\n\\nindeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced  your reasonings\\ncarry my judgment along with them entirely  at first while i\\nsupposed you satisfied that colonel campbell was the giver i saw\\nit only as paternal kindness and thought it the most natural thing\\nin the world  but when you mentioned mrs dixon i felt how much more\\nprobable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship\\nand now i can see it in no other light than as an offering of love\\n\\nthere was no occasion to press the matter farther  the conviction\\nseemed real he looked as if he felt it  she said no more\\nother subjects took their turn and the rest of the dinner passed away\\nthe dessert succeeded the children came in and were talked\\nto and admired amid the usual rate of conversation a few clever\\nthings said a few downright silly but by much the larger proportion\\nneither the one nor the othernothing worse than everyday remarks\\ndull repetitions old news and heavy jokes\\n\\nthe ladies had not been long in the drawingroom before the other ladies\\nin their different divisions arrived  emma watched the entree of her\\nown particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity\\nand grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the\\nartless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful\\nunsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations\\nof pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection\\nthere she satand who would have guessed how many tears she had\\nbeen lately shedding  to be in company nicely dressed herself\\nand seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty\\nand say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour\\njane fairfax did look and move superior but emma suspected she\\nmight have been glad to change feelings with harriet very glad\\nto have purchased the mortification of having lovedyes of having\\nloved even mr elton in vainby the surrender of all the dangerous\\npleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend\\n\\nin so large a party it was not necessary that emma should approach her\\nshe did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much\\nin the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity\\nor interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance\\nbut by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced\\nand she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations\\nwere received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my\\nexcellent friend colonel campbell\\n\\nmrs weston kindhearted and musical was particularly interested\\nby the circumstance and emma could not help being amused at her\\nperseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask\\nand to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious\\nof that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she\\nplainly read in the fair heroines countenance\\n\\nthey were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the\\nearly was frank churchill  in he walked the first and the handsomest\\nand after paying his compliments en passant to miss bates and\\nher niece made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle\\nwhere sat miss woodhouse and till he could find a seat by her\\nwould not sit at all  emma divined what every body present must\\nbe thinking  she was his object and every body must perceive it\\nshe introduced him to her friend miss smith and at convenient\\nmoments afterwards heard what each thought of the other  he had\\nnever seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naivete\\nand she only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment\\nbut she did think there were some looks a little like mr elton\\nemma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence\\n\\nsmiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\\nglancing towards miss fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech\\nhe told her that he had been impatient to leave the diningroom\\nhated sitting longwas always the first to move when he could\\nthat his father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left\\nvery busy over parish businessthat as long as he had staid\\nhowever it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general\\na set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of\\nhighbury altogetherthought it so abundant in agreeable families\\nthat emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place\\nrather too much  she questioned him as to the society in yorkshire\\nthe extent of the neighbourhood about enscombe and the sort\\nand could make out from his answers that as far as enscombe\\nwas concerned there was very little going on that their visitings\\nwere among a range of great families none very near and that even\\nwhen days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even\\nchance that mrs churchill were not in health and spirits for going\\nthat they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that\\nthough he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty\\nwithout considerable address at times that he could get away\\nor introduce an acquaintance for a night\\n\\nshe saw that enscombe could not satisfy and that highbury\\ntaken at its best might reasonably please a young man who had more\\nretirement at home than he liked  his importance at enscombe was\\nvery evident  he did not boast but it naturally betrayed itself\\nthat he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing\\nand on her laughing and noticing it he owned that he believed excepting\\none or two points he could with time persuade her to any thing\\none of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned\\nhe had wanted very much to go abroadhad been very eager indeed\\nto be allowed to travelbut she would not hear of it  this had\\nhappened the year before  now he said he was beginning to have\\nno longer the same wish\\n\\nthe unpersuadable point which he did not mention emma guessed\\nto be good behaviour to his father\\n\\ni have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause\\ni have been here a week tomorrowhalf my time  i never knew\\ndays fly so fast  a week tomorrowand i have hardly begun to\\nenjoy myself  but just got acquainted with mrs weston and others\\ni hate the recollection\\n\\nperhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day\\nout of so few in having your hair cut\\n\\nno said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all\\ni have no pleasure in seeing my friends unless i can believe myself\\nfit to be seen\\n\\nthe rest of the gentlemen being now in the room emma found herself\\nobliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to mr cole\\nwhen mr cole had moved away and her attention could be restored\\nas before she saw frank churchill looking intently across the room\\nat miss fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite\\n\\nwhat is the matter said she\\n\\nhe started  thank you for rousing me he replied  i believe\\ni have been very rude but really miss fairfax has done her hair\\nin so odd a wayso very odd a waythat i cannot keep my eyes\\nfrom her  i never saw any thing so outreethose curlsthis must\\nbe a fancy of her own  i see nobody else looking like her\\ni must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion  shall i\\nyes i willi declare i willand you shall see how she takes it\\nwhether she colours\\n\\nhe was gone immediately and emma soon saw him standing before miss\\nfairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady\\nas he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly\\nin front of miss fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing\\n\\nbefore he could return to his chair it was taken by mrs weston\\n\\nthis is the luxury of a large party said sheone can get\\nnear every body and say every thing  my dear emma i am longing\\nto talk to you  i have been making discoveries and forming plans\\njust like yourself and i must tell them while the idea is fresh\\ndo you know how miss bates and her niece came here\\n\\nhowthey were invited were not they\\n\\noh yesbut how they were conveyed hitherthe manner of their coming\\n\\nthey walked i conclude  how else could they come\\n\\nvery truewell a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\\nit would be to have jane fairfax walking home again late at night\\nand cold as the nights are now  and as i looked at her though i\\nnever saw her appear to more advantage it struck me that she\\nwas heated and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold\\npoor girl  i could not bear the idea of it so as soon as mr weston\\ncame into the room and i could get at him i spoke to him about\\nthe carriage  you may guess how readily he came into my wishes\\nand having his approbation i made my way directly to miss bates\\nto assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took\\nus home for i thought it would be making her comfortable at once\\ngood soul she was as grateful as possible you may be sure\\nnobody was ever so fortunate as herselfbut with many\\nmany thanksthere was no occasion to trouble us for mr knightleys\\ncarriage had brought and was to take them home again  i was\\nquite surprizedvery glad i am sure but really quite surprized\\nsuch a very kind attentionand so thoughtful an attention\\nthe sort of thing that so few men would think of  and in short\\nfrom knowing his usual ways i am very much inclined to think\\nthat it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all\\ni do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself\\nand that it was only as an excuse for assisting them\\n\\nvery likely said emmanothing more likely  i know no man\\nmore likely than mr knightley to do the sort of thingto do any\\nthing really goodnatured useful considerate or benevolent\\nhe is not a gallant man but he is a very humane one and this\\nconsidering jane fairfaxs illhealth would appear a case\\nof humanity to himand for an act of unostentatious kindness\\nthere is nobody whom i would fix on more than on mr knightley\\ni know he had horses todayfor we arrived together and i laughed at\\nhim about it but he said not a word that could betray\\n\\nwell said mrs weston smiling you give him credit for\\nmore simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do\\nfor while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head\\nand i have never been able to get it out again  the more i think\\nof it the more probable it appears  in short i have made a match\\nbetween mr knightley and jane fairfax  see the consequence\\nof keeping you companywhat do you say to it\\n\\nmr knightley and jane fairfax exclaimed emma  dear mrs weston\\nhow could you think of such a thingmr knightleymr knightley\\nmust not marryyou would not have little henry cut out from donwell\\noh no no henry must have donwell  i cannot at all consent to\\nmr knightleys marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely\\ni am amazed that you should think of such a thing\\n\\nmy dear emma i have told you what led me to think of it\\ni do not want the matchi do not want to injure dear little henry\\nbut the idea has been given me by circumstances and if mr knightley\\nreally wished to marry you would not have him refrain on henrys\\naccount a boy of six years old who knows nothing of the matter\\n\\nyes i would  i could not bear to have henry supplanted\\nmr knightley marryno i have never had such an idea and i\\ncannot adopt it now  and jane fairfax too of all women\\n\\nnay she has always been a first favourite with him as you\\nvery well know\\n\\nbut the imprudence of such a match\\n\\ni am not speaking of its prudence merely its probability\\n\\ni see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation\\nthan what you mention  his goodnature his humanity as i tell you\\nwould be quite enough to account for the horses  he has a great\\nregard for the bateses you know independent of jane fairfax\\nand is always glad to shew them attention  my dear mrs weston\\ndo not take to matchmaking  you do it very ill  jane fairfax mistress\\nof the abbeyoh no noevery feeling revolts  for his own sake\\ni would not have him do so mad a thing\\n\\nimprudent if you pleasebut not mad  excepting inequality of fortune\\nand perhaps a little disparity of age i can see nothing unsuitable\\n\\nbut mr knightley does not want to marry  i am sure he has not the\\nleast idea of it  do not put it into his head  why should he marry\\nhe is as happy as possible by himself with his farm and his sheep\\nand his library and all the parish to manage and he is extremely\\nfond of his brothers children  he has no occasion to marry\\neither to fill up his time or his heart\\n\\nmy dear emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really\\nloves jane fairfax\\n\\nnonsense  he does not care about jane fairfax  in the way\\nof love i am sure he does not  he would do any good to her\\nor her family but\\n\\nwell said mrs weston laughing perhaps the greatest good he\\ncould do them would be to give jane such a respectable home\\n\\nif it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself\\na very shameful and degrading connexion  how would he bear to have\\nmiss bates belonging to himto have her haunting the abbey\\nand thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying jane\\nso very kind and obligingbut he always had been such a very\\nkind neighbour  and then fly off through half a sentence\\nto her mothers old petticoat  not that it was such a very old\\npetticoat eitherfor still it would last a great whileand indeed\\nshe must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong\\n\\nfor shame emma  do not mimic her  you divert me against\\nmy conscience  and upon my word i do not think mr knightley would\\nbe much disturbed by miss bates  little things do not irritate him\\nshe might talk on and if he wanted to say any thing himself he would\\nonly talk louder and drown her voice  but the question is not\\nwhether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it\\nand i think he does  i have heard him speak and so must you\\nso very highly of jane fairfax  the interest he takes in her\\nhis anxiety about her healthhis concern that she should have no\\nhappier prospect  i have heard him express himself so warmly on\\nthose pointssuch an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte\\nand of her voice  i have heard him say that he could listen to her\\nfor ever  oh and i had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\\nto methis pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody\\nthough we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present\\nfrom the campbells may it not be from mr knightley  i cannot\\nhelp suspecting him  i think he is just the person to do it\\neven without being in love\\n\\nthen it can be no argument to prove that he is in love\\nbut i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do\\nmr knightley does nothing mysteriously\\n\\ni have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly\\noftener than i should suppose such a circumstance would in the common\\ncourse of things occur to him\\n\\nvery well and if he had intended to give her one he would have\\ntold her so\\n\\nthere might be scruples of delicacy my dear emma  i have a very\\nstrong notion that it comes from him  i am sure he was particularly\\nsilent when mrs cole told us of it at dinner\\n\\nyou take up an idea mrs weston and run away with it as you have\\nmany a time reproached me with doing  i see no sign of attachment\\ni believe nothing of the pianoforteand proof only shall convince\\nme that mr knightley has any thought of marrying jane fairfax\\n\\nthey combated the point some time longer in the same way emma rather\\ngaining ground over the mind of her friend for mrs weston was\\nthe most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room\\nshewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation\\nand at the same moment mr cole approaching to entreat miss woodhouse\\nwould do them the honour of trying it  frank churchill of whom\\nin the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been\\nseeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax\\nfollowed mr cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as\\nin every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very\\nproper compliance\\n\\nshe knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt\\nmore than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste\\nnor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable\\nand could accompany her own voice well  one accompaniment to her song\\ntook her agreeably by surprizea second slightly but correctly\\ntaken by frank churchill  her pardon was duly begged at the close\\nof the song and every thing usual followed  he was accused\\nof having a delightful voice and a perfect knowledge of music\\nwhich was properly denied and that he knew nothing of the matter\\nand had no voice at all roundly asserted  they sang together\\nonce more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax\\nwhose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could\\nattempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own\\n\\nwith mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the\\nnumbers round the instrument to listen  frank churchill sang again\\nthey had sung together once or twice it appeared at weymouth\\nbut the sight of mr knightley among the most attentive soon drew\\naway half emmas mind and she fell into a train of thinking\\non the subject of mrs westons suspicions to which the sweet\\nsounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions\\nher objections to mr knightleys marrying did not in the least subside\\nshe could see nothing but evil in it  it would be a great\\ndisappointment to mr john knightley consequently to isabella\\na real injury to the childrena most mortifying change\\nand material loss to them alla very great deduction from her\\nfathers daily comfortand as to herself she could not at all\\nendure the idea of jane fairfax at donwell abbey  a mrs knightley\\nfor them all to give way tonomr knightley must never marry\\nlittle henry must remain the heir of donwell\\n\\npresently mr knightley looked back and came and sat down by her\\nthey talked at first only of the performance  his admiration\\nwas certainly very warm yet she thought but for mrs weston\\nit would not have struck her  as a sort of touchstone however\\nshe began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece\\nand though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short\\nshe believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any\\nkindness of his own\\n\\ni often feel concern said she that i dare not make our carriage\\nmore useful on such occasions  it is not that i am without the wish\\nbut you know how impossible my father would deem it that james\\nshould putto for such a purpose\\n\\nquite out of the question quite out of the question he replied\\nbut you must often wish it i am sure  and he smiled with such\\nseeming pleasure at the conviction that she must proceed another step\\n\\nthis present from the campbells said shethis pianoforte\\nis very kindly given\\n\\nyes he replied and without the smallest apparent embarrassment\\nbut they would have done better had they given her notice of it\\nsurprizes are foolish things  the pleasure is not enhanced and the\\ninconvenience is often considerable  i should have expected better\\njudgment in colonel campbell\\n\\nfrom that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley\\nhad had no concern in giving the instrument  but whether he\\nwere entirely free from peculiar attachmentwhether there\\nwere no actual preferenceremained a little longer doubtful\\ntowards the end of janes second song her voice grew thick\\n\\nthat will do said he when it was finished thinking aloud\\nyou have sung quite enough for one eveningnow be quiet\\n\\nanother song however was soon begged for  one morethey would\\nnot fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for\\none more  and frank churchill was heard to say i think you could\\nmanage this without effort the first part is so very trifling\\nthe strength of the song falls on the second\\n\\nmr knightley grew angry\\n\\nthat fellow said he indignantly thinks of nothing but shewing\\noff his own voice  this must not be  and touching miss bates\\nwho at that moment passed nearmiss bates are you mad to let\\nyour niece sing herself hoarse in this manner  go and interfere\\nthey have no mercy on her\\n\\nmiss bates in her real anxiety for jane could hardly stay even\\nto be grateful before she stept forward and put an end to all\\nfarther singing  here ceased the concert part of the evening\\nfor miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers\\nbut soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing\\noriginating nobody exactly knew wherewas so effectually promoted\\nby mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away\\nto give proper space  mrs weston capital in her countrydances\\nwas seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and frank churchill\\ncoming up with most becoming gallantry to emma had secured her hand\\nand led her up to the top\\n\\nwhile waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off\\nemma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her\\nvoice and her taste to look about and see what became of mr knightley\\nthis would be a trial  he was no dancer in general  if he were to be\\nvery alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something\\nthere was no immediate appearance  no he was talking to mrs cole\\nhe was looking on unconcerned jane was asked by somebody else\\nand he was still talking to mrs cole\\n\\nemma had no longer an alarm for henry his interest was yet safe\\nand she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment\\nnot more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the\\nsuddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well\\nmatched in a partner  they were a couple worth looking at\\n\\ntwo dances unfortunately were all that could be allowed\\nit was growing late and miss bates became anxious to get home\\non her mothers account  after some attempts therefore to be\\npermitted to begin again they were obliged to thank mrs weston\\nlook sorrowful and have done\\n\\nperhaps it is as well said frank churchill as he attended emma\\nto her carriage  i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid\\ndancing would not have agreed with me after yours\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix\\n\\n\\nemma did not repent her condescension in going to the coles\\nthe visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day\\nand all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side\\nof dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour\\nof popularity  she must have delighted the colesworthy people\\nwho deserved to be made happyand left a name behind her that would\\nnot soon die away\\n\\nperfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were\\ntwo points on which she was not quite easy  she doubted whether\\nshe had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying\\nher suspicions of jane fairfaxs feelings to frank churchill\\nit was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it\\nwould escape her and his submission to all that she told\\nwas a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult\\nfor her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue\\n\\nthe other circumstance of regret related also to jane fairfax\\nand there she had no doubt  she did unfeignedly and unequivocally\\nregret the inferiority of her own playing and singing  she did\\nmost heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhoodand sat\\ndown and practised vigorously an hour and a half\\n\\nshe was then interrupted by harriets coming in and if harriets\\npraise could have satisfied her she might soon have been comforted\\n\\noh if i could but play as well as you and miss fairfax\\n\\ndont class us together harriet  my playing is no more like\\nhers than a lamp is like sunshine\\n\\noh deari think you play the best of the two  i think you play\\nquite as well as she does  i am sure i had much rather hear you\\nevery body last night said how well you played\\n\\nthose who knew any thing about it must have felt the difference\\nthe truth is harriet that my playing is just good enough to be praised\\nbut jane fairfaxs is much beyond it\\n\\nwell i always shall think that you play quite as well as she does\\nor that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out\\nmr cole said how much taste you had and mr frank churchill talked\\na great deal about your taste and that he valued taste much more\\nthan execution\\n\\nah but jane fairfax has them both harriet\\n\\nare you sure  i saw she had execution but i did not know she had\\nany taste  nobody talked about it  and i hate italian singing\\nthere is no understanding a word of it  besides if she does play\\nso very well you know it is no more than she is obliged to do\\nbecause she will have to teach  the coxes were wondering last night\\nwhether she would get into any great family  how did you think the\\ncoxes looked\\n\\njust as they always dovery vulgar\\n\\nthey told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly\\nbut it is nothing of any consequence\\n\\nemma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful\\nof its producing mr elton\\n\\nthey told methat mr martin dined with them last saturday\\n\\noh\\n\\nhe came to their father upon some business and he asked him\\nto stay to dinner\\n\\noh\\n\\nthey talked a great deal about him especially anne cox\\ni do not know what she meant but she asked me if i thought i\\nshould go and stay there again next summer\\n\\nshe meant to be impertinently curious just as such an anne cox\\nshould be\\n\\nshe said he was very agreeable the day he dined there  he sat\\nby her at dinner  miss nash thinks either of the coxes would\\nbe very glad to marry him\\n\\nvery likelyi think they are without exception the most vulgar\\ngirls in highbury\\n\\nharriet had business at fordsemma thought it most prudent to go\\nwith her  another accidental meeting with the martins was possible\\nand in her present state would be dangerous\\n\\nharriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always\\nvery long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins\\nand changing her mind emma went to the door for amusementmuch could\\nnot be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury\\nmr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting himself in at\\nthe officedoor mr coles carriagehorses returning from exercise\\nor a stray letterboy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest\\nobjects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on\\nthe butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from\\nshop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone\\nand a string of dawdling children round the bakers little bowwindow\\neyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain\\nand was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door\\na mind lively and at ease can do with seeing nothing and can see\\nnothing that does not answer\\n\\nshe looked down the randalls road  the scene enlarged\\ntwo persons appeared mrs weston and her soninlaw they were\\nwalking into highburyto hartfield of course  they were stopping\\nhowever in the first place at mrs batess whose house was\\na little nearer randalls than fords and had all but knocked\\nwhen emma caught their eyeimmediately they crossed the road\\nand came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterdays\\nengagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting\\nmrs weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses\\nin order to hear the new instrument\\n\\nfor my companion tells me said she that i absolutely promised\\nmiss bates last night that i would come this morning  i was\\nnot aware of it myself  i did not know that i had fixed a day\\nbut as he says i did i am going now\\n\\nand while mrs weston pays her visit i may be allowed i hope\\nsaid frank churchill to join your party and wait for her at hartfield\\nif you are going home\\n\\nmrs weston was disappointed\\n\\ni thought you meant to go with me  they would be very much pleased\\n\\nme  i should be quite in the way  but perhapsi may be equally\\nin the way here  miss woodhouse looks as if she did not want me\\nmy aunt always sends me off when she is shopping  she says i fidget\\nher to death and miss woodhouse looks as if she could almost say\\nthe same  what am i to do\\n\\ni am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting\\nfor my friend  she will probably have soon done and then we\\nshall go home  but you had better go with mrs weston and hear\\nthe instrument\\n\\nwellif you advise itbut with a smile if colonel campbell\\nshould have employed a careless friend and if it should prove\\nto have an indifferent tonewhat shall i say  i shall be no\\nsupport to mrs weston  she might do very well by herself\\na disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips but i\\nam the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood\\n\\ni do not believe any such thing replied emmai am persuaded\\nthat you can be as insincere as your neighbours when it is necessary\\nbut there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent\\nquite otherwise indeed if i understood miss fairfaxs opinion\\nlast night\\n\\ndo come with me said mrs weston if it be not very disagreeable\\nto you  it need not detain us long  we will go to hartfield afterwards\\nwe will follow them to hartfield  i really wish you to call with me\\nit will be felt so great an attention and i always thought you\\nmeant it\\n\\nhe could say no more and with the hope of hartfield to reward him\\nreturned with mrs weston to mrs batess door  emma watched them in\\nand then joined harriet at the interesting countertrying with all\\nthe force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain\\nmuslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon\\nbe it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern\\nat last it was all settled even to the destination of the parcel\\n\\nshould i send it to mrs goddards maam asked mrs ford\\nyesnoyes to mrs goddards only my pattern gown is\\nat hartfield  no you shall send it to hartfield if you please\\nbut then mrs goddard will want to see itand i could take the\\npattern gown home any day  but i shall want the ribbon directly\\nso it had better go to hartfieldat least the ribbon  you could\\nmake it into two parcels mrs ford could not you\\n\\nit is not worth while harriet to give mrs ford the trouble\\nof two parcels\\n\\nno more it is\\n\\nno trouble in the world maam said the obliging mrs ford\\n\\noh but indeed i would much rather have it only in one\\nthen if you please you shall send it all to mrs goddards\\ni do not knowno i think miss woodhouse i may just as well\\nhave it sent to hartfield and take it home with me at night\\nwhat do you advise\\n\\nthat you do not give another halfsecond to the subject\\nto hartfield if you please mrs ford\\n\\naye that will be much best said harriet quite satisfied\\ni should not at all like to have it sent to mrs goddards\\n\\nvoices approached the shopor rather one voice and two ladies\\nmrs weston and miss bates met them at the door\\n\\nmy dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to\\nentreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while\\nand give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith\\nhow do you do miss smithvery well i thank youand i begged\\nmrs weston to come with me that i might be sure of succeeding\\n\\ni hope mrs bates and miss fairfax are\\n\\nvery well i am much obliged to you  my mother is delightfully well\\nand jane caught no cold last night  how is mr woodhousei am so glad\\nto hear such a good account  mrs weston told me you were here\\noh then said i i must run across i am sure miss woodhouse will\\nallow me just to run across and entreat her to come in my mother\\nwill be so very happy to see herand now we are such a nice party\\nshe cannot refuseaye pray do said mr frank churchill\\nmiss woodhouses opinion of the instrument will be worth having\\nbut said i i shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go\\nwith meoh said he wait half a minute till i have finished\\nmy jobfor would you believe it miss woodhouse there he is\\nin the most obliging manner in the world fastening in the rivet of my\\nmothers spectaclesthe rivet came out you know this morning\\nso very obligingfor my mother had no use of her spectacles\\ncould not put them on  and by the bye every body ought to have\\ntwo pair of spectacles they should indeed  jane said so\\ni meant to take them over to john saunders the first thing i did\\nbut something or other hindered me all the morning first one thing\\nthen another there is no saying what you know  at one time patty came\\nto say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping  oh said i\\npatty do not come with your bad news to me  here is the rivet\\nof your mistresss spectacles out  then the baked apples came home\\nmrs wallis sent them by her boy they are extremely civil and\\nobliging to us the wallises alwaysi have heard some people\\nsay that mrs wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer\\nbut we have never known any thing but the greatest attention\\nfrom them  and it cannot be for the value of our custom now\\nfor what is our consumption of bread you know  only three of us\\nbesides dear jane at presentand she really eats nothingmakes such\\na shocking breakfast you would be quite frightened if you saw it\\ni dare not let my mother know how little she eatsso i say one\\nthing and then i say another and it passes off  but about the\\nmiddle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes\\nso well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome\\nfor i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry\\ni happened to meet him in the street  not that i had any doubt before\\ni have so often heard mr woodhouse recommend a baked apple\\ni believe it is the only way that mr woodhouse thinks the\\nfruit thoroughly wholesome  we have appledumplings however\\nvery often  patty makes an excellent appledumpling well\\nmrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will\\noblige us\\n\\nemma would be very happy to wait on mrs bates c and they\\ndid at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from miss\\nbates than\\n\\nhow do you do mrs ford  i beg your pardon  i did not see\\nyou before  i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons\\nfrom town  jane came back delighted yesterday  thank ye\\nthe gloves do very wellonly a little too large about the wrist\\nbut jane is taking them in\\n\\nwhat was i talking of said she beginning again when they were\\nall in the street\\n\\nemma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix\\n\\ni declare i cannot recollect what i was talking ofoh my\\nmothers spectacles  so very obliging of mr frank churchill\\noh said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job\\nof this kind excessivelywhich you know shewed him to be so\\nvery    indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him\\nbefore and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any\\nthing    i do congratulate you mrs weston most warmly\\nhe seems every thing the fondest parent could    oh said he\\ni can fasten the rivet  i like a job of that sort excessively\\ni never shall forget his manner  and when i brought out the baked\\napples from the closet and hoped our friends would be so very\\nobliging as to take some oh said he directly there is nothing\\nin the way of fruit half so good and these are the finestlooking\\nhomebaked apples i ever saw in my life  that you know was so\\nvery    and i am sure by his manner it was no compliment\\nindeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them\\nfull justiceonly we do not have them baked more than twice\\nand mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times\\nbut miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it  the apples\\nthemselves are the very finest sort for baking beyond a doubt\\nall from donwellsome of mr knightleys most liberal supply\\nhe sends us a sack every year and certainly there never was such\\na keeping apple anywhere as one of his treesi believe there\\nis two of them  my mother says the orchard was always famous\\nin her younger days  but i was really quite shocked the other day\\nfor mr knightley called one morning and jane was eating these apples\\nand we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them\\nand he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock\\ni am sure you must be said he and i will send you\\nanother supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use\\nwilliam larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year\\ni will send you some more before they get good for nothing\\nso i begged he would notfor really as to ours being gone i could\\nnot absolutely say that we had a great many leftit was but half\\na dozen indeed but they should be all kept for jane and i could\\nnot at all bear that he should be sending us more so liberal as he\\nhad been already and jane said the same  and when he was gone\\nshe almost quarrelled with meno i should not say quarrelled\\nfor we never had a quarrel in our lives but she was quite distressed\\nthat i had owned the apples were so nearly gone she wished i had\\nmade him believe we had a great many left  oh said i my dear\\ni did say as much as i could  however the very same evening\\nwilliam larkins came over with a large basket of apples the same\\nsort of apples a bushel at least and i was very much obliged\\nand went down and spoke to william larkins and said every thing\\nas you may suppose  william larkins is such an old acquaintance\\ni am always glad to see him  but however i found afterwards\\nfrom patty that william said it was all the apples of that sort\\nhis master had he had brought them alland now his master had not\\none left to bake or boil  william did not seem to mind it himself\\nhe was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william\\nyou know thinks more of his masters profit than any thing\\nbut mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being\\nall sent away  she could not bear that her master should not be\\nable to have another appletart this spring  he told patty this\\nbut bid her not mind it and be sure not to say any thing to us\\nabout it for mrs hodges would be cross sometimes and as long as\\nso many sacks were sold it did not signify who ate the remainder\\nand so patty told me and i was excessively shocked indeed\\ni would not have mr knightley know any thing about it for\\nthe world  he would be so very    i wanted to keep it from\\njanes knowledge but unluckily i had mentioned it before i was\\naware\\n\\nmiss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors\\nwalked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to\\npursued only by the sounds of her desultory goodwill\\n\\npray take care mrs weston there is a step at the turning\\npray take care miss woodhouse ours is rather a dark staircase\\nrather darker and narrower than one could wish  miss smith\\npray take care  miss woodhouse i am quite concerned i am sure you\\nhit your foot  miss smith the step at the turning\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x\\n\\n\\nthe appearance of the little sittingroom as they entered\\nwas tranquillity itself mrs bates deprived of her usual employment\\nslumbering on one side of the fire frank churchill at a table\\nnear her most deedily occupied about her spectacles and jane fairfax\\nstanding with her back to them intent on her pianoforte\\n\\nbusy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most\\nhappy countenance on seeing emma again\\n\\nthis is a pleasure said he in rather a low voice coming at\\nleast ten minutes earlier than i had calculated  you find me\\ntrying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed\\n\\nwhat said mrs weston have not you finished it yet you would\\nnot earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate\\n\\ni have not been working uninterruptedly he replied i have been\\nassisting miss fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily\\nit was not quite firm an unevenness in the floor i believe\\nyou see we have been wedging one leg with paper  this was very kind\\nof you to be persuaded to come  i was almost afraid you would be\\nhurrying home\\n\\nhe contrived that she should be seated by him and was sufficiently\\nemployed in looking out the best baked apple for her and trying\\nto make her help or advise him in his work till jane fairfax was\\nquite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again  that she was not\\nimmediately ready emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves\\nshe had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it\\nwithout emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance\\nand emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin\\nand could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again\\n\\nat last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given\\nthe powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to\\nmrs weston had been delighted before and was delighted again\\nemma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every\\nproper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the\\nhighest promise\\n\\nwhoever colonel campbell might employ said frank churchill\\nwith a smile at emma the person has not chosen ill  i heard a good\\ndeal of colonel campbells taste at weymouth and the softness of the\\nupper notes i am sure is exactly what he and all that party would\\nparticularly prize  i dare say miss fairfax that he either gave\\nhis friend very minute directions or wrote to broadwood himself\\ndo not you think so\\n\\njane did not look round  she was not obliged to hear  mrs weston\\nhad been speaking to her at the same moment\\n\\nit is not fair said emma in a whisper mine was a random guess\\ndo not distress her\\n\\nhe shook his head with a smile and looked as if he had very little\\ndoubt and very little mercy  soon afterwards he began again\\n\\nhow much your friends in ireland must be enjoying your pleasure\\non this occasion miss fairfax  i dare say they often think of you\\nand wonder which will be the day the precise day of the instruments\\ncoming to hand  do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business\\nto be going forward just at this timedo you imagine it to be\\nthe consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may\\nhave sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time\\nto depend upon contingencies and conveniences\\n\\nhe paused  she could not but hear she could not avoid answering\\n\\ntill i have a letter from colonel campbell said she in a voice\\nof forced calmness i can imagine nothing with any confidence\\nit must be all conjecture\\n\\nconjectureaye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes\\none conjectures wrong  i wish i could conjecture how soon i shall\\nmake this rivet quite firm  what nonsense one talks miss woodhouse\\nwhen hard at work if one talks at allyour real workmen\\ni suppose hold their tongues but we gentlemen labourers if we get\\nhold of a wordmiss fairfax said something about conjecturing\\nthere it is done  i have the pleasure madam to mrs bates\\nof restoring your spectacles healed for the present\\n\\nhe was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape\\na little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged\\nmiss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more\\n\\nif you are very kind said he it will be one of the waltzes\\nwe danced last nightlet me live them over again  you did not\\nenjoy them as i did you appeared tired the whole time  i believe\\nyou were glad we danced no longer but i would have given worlds\\nall the worlds one ever has to givefor another halfhour\\n\\nshe played\\n\\nwhat felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy\\nif i mistake not that was danced at weymouth\\n\\nshe looked up at him for a moment coloured deeply and played\\nsomething else  he took some music from a chair near the pianoforte\\nand turning to emma said\\n\\nhere is something quite new to me  do you know itcramer\\nand here are a new set of irish melodies  that from such a quarter\\none might expect  this was all sent with the instrument  very thoughtful\\nof colonel campbell was not ithe knew miss fairfax could have\\nno music here  i honour that part of the attention particularly\\nit shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart  nothing hastily\\ndone nothing incomplete  true affection only could have prompted it\\n\\nemma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused\\nand when on glancing her eye towards jane fairfax she caught\\nthe remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush\\nof consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight\\nshe had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction\\nwith respect to herthis amiable upright perfect jane fairfax\\nwas apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings\\n\\nhe brought all the music to her and they looked it over together\\nemma took the opportunity of whispering\\n\\nyou speak too plain  she must understand you\\n\\ni hope she does  i would have her understand me  i am not\\nin the least ashamed of my meaning\\n\\nbut really i am half ashamed and wish i had never taken up\\nthe idea\\n\\ni am very glad you did and that you communicated it to

quite delightful\\nto have you all meet soour little room so honoured\\n\\nshe was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke and opening\\nthe casement there immediately called mr knightleys attention\\nand every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard\\nby the others as if it had passed within the same apartment\\n\\nhow d ye dohow dye dovery well i thank you  so obliged\\nto you for the carriage last night  we were just in time\\nmy mother just ready for us  pray come in do come in  you will\\nfind some friends here\\n\\nso began miss bates and mr knightley

fairfaxi hope she\\ncaught no cold last night  how is she today tell me how miss\\nfairfax is\\n\\nand miss bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he\\nwould hear her in any thing else  the listeners were amused\\nand mrs weston gave emma a look of particular meaning  but emma\\nstill shook her head in steady scepticism\\n\\nso obliged to youso very much obliged to you for the carriage\\nresumed miss bates\\n\\nhe cut her short with\\n\\ni am going to kingston  can i do any thing for you\\n\\noh dear kingstonare youmrs cole was saying the other day\\nshe wanted something

frank churchill are hearing every thing\\nthat passes  and raising his voice still more i do not see why miss\\nfairfax should not be mentioned too  i think miss fairfax dances\\nvery well and mrs weston is the very best countrydance player\\nwithout exception in england  now if your friends have any gratitude\\nthey will say something pretty loud about you and me in return\\nbut i cannot stay to hear it\\n\\noh  mr knightley one moment more something of consequence\\nso shockedjane and i are both so shocked about the apples\\n\\nwhat is the matter now\\n\\nto think of your sending us all your store apples  you said you had\\na great many and now you have not one left  we really are so shocked\\nmrs hodges may well be angry  william larkins mentioned it here\\nyou should not have done it indeed you should not  ah he is off\\nhe never can bear to be thanked  but i thought he would have staid now\\nand it would have been a pity not to have mentioned    well\\nreturning to the room i have not been able to succeed\\nmr knightley cannot stop  he is going to kingston  he asked me\\nif he could do any thing   \\n\\nyes said jane we heard his kind offers we heard every thing\\n\\noh yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door\\nwas open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud\\nyou must have heard every thing to be sure  can i do any thing\\nfor you at kingston said he so i just mentioned    oh\\nmiss woodhouse must you be goingyou seem but just comeso very\\nobliging of you\\n\\nemma found it really time to be at home the visit had already\\nlasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was\\nperceived to be gone that mrs weston and her companion taking\\nleave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young\\nladies to hartfield gates before they set off for randalls\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi\\n\\n\\nit may be possible to do without dancing entirely  instances have\\nbeen known of young people passing many many months successively\\nwithout being at any ball of any description and no material injury\\naccrue either to body or mindbut when a beginning is made\\nwhen the felicities of rapid motion have once been though slightly\\nfeltit must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more\\n\\nfrank churchill had danced once at highbury and longed to dance again\\nand the last halfhour of an evening which mr woodhouse was persuaded\\nto spend with his daughter at randalls was passed by the two young\\npeople in schemes on the subject  franks was the first idea\\nand his the greatest zeal in pursuing it for the lady was the best\\njudge of the difficulties and the most solicitous for accommodation\\nand appearance  but still she had inclination enough for shewing\\npeople again how delightfully mr frank churchill and miss\\nwoodhouse dancedfor doing that in which she need not blush to compare\\nherself with jane fairfaxand even for simple dancing itself\\nwithout any of the wicked aids of vanityto assist him first\\nin pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made\\nto holdand then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour\\nin the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr weston could\\nsay of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest\\n\\nhis first proposition and request that the dance begun at mr coles\\nshould be finished therethat the same party should be collected\\nand the same musician engaged met with the readiest acquiescence\\nmr weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment\\nand mrs weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they\\ncould wish to dance and the interesting employment had followed\\nof reckoning up exactly who there would be and portioning out the\\nindispensable division of space to every couple\\n\\nyou and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two\\nmiss coxes five had been repeated many times over  and there\\nwill be the two gilberts young cox my father and myself\\nbesides mr knightley  yes that will be quite enough for pleasure\\nyou and miss smith and miss fairfax will be three and the two miss\\ncoxes five and for five couple there will be plenty of room\\n\\nbut soon it came to be on one side\\n\\nbut will there be good room for five couplei really do not think\\nthere will\\n\\non another\\n\\nand after all five couple are not enough to make it worth\\nwhile to stand up  five couple are nothing when one thinks\\nseriously about it  it will not do to invite five couple\\nit can be allowable only as the thought of the moment\\n\\nsomebody said that miss gilbert was expected at her brothers\\nand must be invited with the rest  somebody else believed\\nmrs gilbert would have danced the other evening if she had\\nbeen asked  a word was put in for a second young cox and at last\\nmr weston naming one family of cousins who must be included\\nand another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out\\nit became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten\\nand a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they\\ncould be disposed of\\n\\nthe doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other\\nmight not they use both rooms and dance across the passage\\nit seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that\\nmany of them wanted a better  emma said it would be awkward\\nmrs weston was in distress about the supper and mr woodhouse\\nopposed it earnestly on the score of health  it made him so\\nvery unhappy indeed that it could not be persevered in\\n\\noh no said he it would be the extreme of imprudence\\ni could not bear it for emmaemma is not strong  she would\\ncatch a dreadful cold  so would poor little harriet\\nso you would all  mrs weston you would be quite laid up\\ndo not let them talk of such a wild thing  pray do not let them\\ntalk of it  that young man speaking lower is very thoughtless\\ndo not tell his father but that young man is not quite the thing\\nhe has been opening the doors very often this evening and keeping\\nthem open very inconsiderately  he does not think of the draught\\ni do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite\\nthe thing\\n\\nmrs weston was sorry for such a charge  she knew the importance\\nof it and said every thing in her power to do it away  every door\\nwas now closed the passage plan given up and the first scheme\\nof dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again\\nand with such goodwill on frank churchills part that the space\\nwhich a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient\\nfor five couple was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough\\nfor ten\\n\\nwe were too magnificent said he  we allowed unnecessary room\\nten couple may stand here very well\\n\\nemma demurred  it would be a crowda sad crowd and what could\\nbe worse than dancing without space to turn in\\n\\nvery true he gravely replied it was very bad  but still he\\nwent on measuring and still he ended with\\n\\ni think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple\\n\\nno no said she you are quite unreasonable  it would be dreadful\\nto be standing so close  nothing can be farther from pleasure\\nthan to be dancing in a crowdand a crowd in a little room\\n\\nthere is no denying it he replied  i agree with you exactly\\na crowd in a little roommiss woodhouse you have the art of giving\\npictures in a few words  exquisite quite exquisitestill however\\nhaving proceeded so far one is unwilling to give the matter up\\nit would be a disappointment to my fatherand altogetheri do\\nnot know thati am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand\\nhere very well\\n\\nemma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\\nselfwilled and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure\\nof dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave\\nthe rest  had she intended ever to marry him it might have been\\nworth while to pause and consider and try to understand the value\\nof his preference and the character of his temper but for\\nall the purposes of their acquaintance he was quite amiable enough\\n\\nbefore the middle of the next day he was at hartfield and he entered\\nthe room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance\\nof the scheme  it soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement\\n\\nwell miss woodhouse he almost immediately began your inclination\\nfor dancing has not been quite frightened away i hope by the\\nterrors of my fathers little rooms  i bring a new proposal\\non the subjecta thought of my fathers which waits only your\\napprobation to be acted upon  may i hope for the honour of your\\nhand for the two first dances of this little projected ball\\nto be given not at randalls but at the crown inn\\n\\nthe crown\\n\\nyes if you and mr woodhouse see no objection and i trust you cannot\\nmy father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there\\nbetter accommodations he can promise them and not a less grateful\\nwelcome than at randalls  it is his own idea  mrs weston sees\\nno objection to it provided you are satisfied  this is what we\\nall feel  oh you were perfectly right  ten couple in either of\\nthe randalls rooms would have been insufferabledreadfuli felt\\nhow right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing\\nany thing to like to yield  is not it a good exchangeyou consent\\ni hope you consent\\n\\nit appears to me a plan that nobody can object to if mr and\\nmrs weston do not  i think it admirable and as far as i can\\nanswer for myself shall be most happyit seems the only improvement\\nthat could be  papa do you not think it an excellent improvement\\n\\nshe was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully\\ncomprehended and then being quite new farther representations\\nwere necessary to make it acceptable\\n\\nno he thought it very far from an improvementa very bad plan\\nmuch worse than the other  a room at an inn was always damp\\nand dangerous never properly aired or fit to be inhabited\\nif they must dance they had better dance at randalls  he had never\\nbeen in the room at the crown in his lifedid not know the people\\nwho kept it by sightoh noa very bad plan  they would catch\\nworse colds at the crown than anywhere\\n\\ni was going to observe sir said frank churchill\\nthat one of the great recommendations of this change would\\nbe the very little danger of any bodys catching cold\\nso much less danger at the crown than at randalls  mr perry\\nmight have reason to regret the alteration but nobody else could\\n\\nsir said mr woodhouse rather warmly you are very much\\nmistaken if you suppose mr perry to be that sort of character\\nmr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill  but i\\ndo not understand how the room at the crown can be safer for you\\nthan your fathers house\\n\\nfrom the very circumstance of its being larger sir  we shall have\\nno occasion to open the windows at allnot once the whole evening\\nand it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows letting in cold\\nair upon heated bodies which as you well know sir does the mischief\\n\\nopen the windowsbut surely mr churchill nobody would think\\nof opening the windows at randalls  nobody could be so imprudent\\ni never heard of such a thing  dancing with open windowsi am sure\\nneither your father nor mrs weston poor miss taylor that was\\nwould suffer it\\n\\nah sirbut a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind\\na windowcurtain and throw up a sash without its being suspected\\ni have often known it done myself\\n\\nhave you indeed sirbless me  i never could have supposed it\\nbut i live out of the world and am often astonished at what i hear\\nhowever this does make a difference and perhaps when we come\\nto talk it overbut these sort of things require a good deal\\nof consideration  one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry\\nif mr and mrs weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning\\nwe may talk it over and see what can be done\\n\\nbut unfortunately sir my time is so limited\\n\\noh interrupted emma there will be plenty of time for talking\\nevery thing over  there is no hurry at all  if it can be contrived\\nto be at the crown papa it will be very convenient for the horses\\nthey will be so near their own stable\\n\\nso they will my dear  that is a great thing  not that james\\never complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can\\nif i could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly airedbut is\\nmrs stokes to be trusted  i doubt it  i do not know her\\neven by sight\\n\\ni can answer for every thing of that nature sir because it will\\nbe under mrs westons care  mrs weston undertakes to direct\\nthe whole\\n\\nthere papanow you must be satisfiedour own dear mrs weston\\nwho is carefulness itself  do not you remember what mr perry said\\nso many years ago when i had the measles  if miss taylor undertakes\\nto wrap miss emma up you need not have any fears sir  how often\\nhave i heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her\\n\\naye very true  mr perry did say so  i shall never forget it\\npoor little emma  you were very bad with the measles that is\\nyou would have been very bad but for perrys great attention\\nhe came four times a day for a week  he said from the first\\nit was a very good sortwhich was our great comfort but the measles\\nare a dreadful complaint  i hope whenever poor isabellas little ones\\nhave the measles she will send for perry\\n\\nmy father and mrs weston are at the crown at this moment\\nsaid frank churchill examining the capabilities of the house\\ni left them there and came on to hartfield impatient for your opinion\\nand hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice\\non the spot  i was desired to say so from both  it would be the\\ngreatest pleasure to them if you could allow me to attend you there\\nthey can do nothing satisfactorily without you\\n\\nemma was most happy to be called to such a council and her father\\nengaging to think it all over while she was gone the two young\\npeople set off together without delay for the crown  there were\\nmr and mrs weston delighted to see her and receive her approbation\\nvery busy and very happy in their different way she in some\\nlittle distress and he finding every thing perfect\\n\\nemma said she this paper is worse than i expected\\nlook in places you see it is dreadfully dirty and the wainscot\\nis more yellow and forlorn than any thing i could have imagined\\n\\nmy dear you are too particular said her husband  what does\\nall that signify  you will see nothing of it by candlelight\\nit will be as clean as randalls by candlelight  we never see any\\nthing of it on our clubnights\\n\\nthe ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant men never\\nknow when things are dirty or not and the gentlemen perhaps\\nthought each to himself women will have their little nonsenses\\nand needless cares\\n\\none perplexity however arose which the gentlemen did not disdain\\nit regarded a supperroom  at the time of the ballrooms being built\\nsuppers had not been in question and a small cardroom adjoining\\nwas the only addition  what was to be done  this cardroom would\\nbe wanted as a cardroom now or if cards were conveniently voted\\nunnecessary by their four selves still was it not too small for\\nany comfortable supper  another room of much better size might be\\nsecured for the purpose but it was at the other end of the house\\nand a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it\\nthis made a difficulty  mrs weston was afraid of draughts\\nfor the young people in that passage and neither emma nor the\\ngentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded\\nat supper\\n\\nmrs weston proposed having no regular supper merely sandwiches\\nc set out in the little room but that was scouted as a\\nwretched suggestion  a private dance without sitting down to supper\\nwas pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women\\nand mrs weston must not speak of it again  she then took another\\nline of expediency and looking into the doubtful room observed\\n\\ni do not think it is so very small  we shall not be many\\nyou know\\n\\nand mr weston at the same time walking briskly with long steps\\nthrough the passage was calling out\\n\\nyou talk a great deal of the length of this passage my dear\\nit is a mere nothing after all and not the least draught from\\nthe stairs\\n\\ni wish said mrs weston one could know which arrangement our\\nguests in general would like best  to do what would be most generally\\npleasing must be our objectif one could but tell what that would be\\n\\nyes very true cried frank very true  you want your neighbours\\nopinions  i do not wonder at you  if one could ascertain what the\\nchief of themthe coles for instance  they are not far off\\nshall i call upon them  or miss bates  she is still nearer\\nand i do not know whether miss bates is not as likely to understand\\nthe inclinations of the rest of the people as any body  i think\\nwe do want a larger council  suppose i go and invite miss bates\\nto join us\\n\\nwellif you please said mrs weston rather hesitating if you\\nthink she will be of any use\\n\\nyou will get nothing to the purpose from miss bates said emma\\nshe will be all delight and gratitude but she will tell you nothing\\nshe will not even listen to your questions  i see no advantage in\\nconsulting miss bates\\n\\nbut she is so amusing so extremely amusing  i am very fond\\nof hearing miss bates talk  and i need not bring the whole family\\nyou know\\n\\nhere mr weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed\\ngave it his decided approbation\\n\\naye do frankgo and fetch miss bates and let us end the matter\\nat once  she will enjoy the scheme i am sure and i do not know\\na properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties\\nfetch miss bates  we are growing a little too nice  she is\\na standing lesson of how to be happy  but fetch them both\\ninvite them both\\n\\nboth sir  can the old lady   \\n\\nthe old lady  no the young lady to be sure  i shall think you\\na great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece\\n\\noh  i beg your pardon sir  i did not immediately recollect\\nundoubtedly if you wish it i will endeavour to persuade them both\\nand away he ran\\n\\nlong before he reappeared attending the short neat briskmoving aunt\\nand her elegant niecemrs weston like a sweettempered\\nwoman and a good wife had examined the passage again\\nand found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before\\nindeed very trifling and here ended the difficulties of decision\\nall the rest in speculation at least was perfectly smooth\\nall the minor arrangements of table and chair lights and music\\ntea and supper made themselves or were left as mere trifles\\nto be settled at any time between mrs weston and mrs stokes\\nevery body invited was certainly to come frank had already written\\nto enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight\\nwhich could not possibly be refused  and a delightful dance it was\\nto be\\n\\nmost cordially when miss bates arrived did she agree that it must\\nas a counsellor she was not wanted but as an approver a much\\nsafer character she was truly welcome  her approbation at once\\ngeneral and minute warm and incessant could not but please\\nand for another halfhour they were all walking to and fro\\nbetween the different rooms some suggesting some attending\\nand all in happy enjoyment of the future  the party did not break\\nup without emmas being positively secured for the two first dances\\nby the hero of the evening nor without her overhearing mr weston\\nwhisper to his wife he has asked her my dear  thats right\\ni knew he would\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xii\\n\\n\\none thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball\\ncompletely satisfactory to emmaits being fixed for a day within\\nthe granted term of frank churchills stay in surry for in spite\\nof mr westons confidence she could not think it so very impossible\\nthat the churchills might not allow their nephew to remain\\na day beyond his fortnight  but this was not judged feasible\\nthe preparations must take their time nothing could be properly\\nready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they\\nmust be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertaintyat the risk\\nin her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain\\n\\nenscombe however was gracious gracious in fact if not in word\\nhis wish of staying longer evidently did not please but it was\\nnot opposed  all was safe and prosperous and as the removal of one\\nsolicitude generally makes way for another emma being now certain\\nof her ball began to adopt as the next vexation mr knightleys\\nprovoking indifference about it  either because he did not\\ndance himself or because the plan had been formed without his\\nbeing consulted he seemed resolved that it should not interest him\\ndetermined against its exciting any present curiosity or affording\\nhim any future amusement  to her voluntary communications emma\\ncould get no more approving reply than\\n\\nvery well  if the westons think it worth while to be at all this\\ntrouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment i have nothing\\nto say against it but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me\\noh yes i must be there i could not refuse and i will keep\\nas much awake as i can but i would rather be at home looking over\\nwilliam larkinss weeks account much rather i confess\\npleasure in seeing dancingnot i indeedi never look at it\\ni do not know who doesfine dancing i believe like virtue\\nmust be its own reward  those who are standing by are usually\\nthinking of something very different\\n\\nthis emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry\\nit was not in compliment to jane fairfax however that he was\\nso indifferent or so indignant he was not guided by her feelings\\nin reprobating the ball for she enjoyed the thought of it\\nto an extraordinary degree  it made her animatedopen hearted\\nshe voluntarily said\\n\\noh  miss woodhouse i hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball\\nwhat a disappointment it would be  i do look forward to it i own\\nwith very great pleasure\\n\\nit was not to oblige jane fairfax therefore that he would have\\npreferred the society of william larkins  noshe was more and more\\nconvinced that mrs weston was quite mistaken in that surmise\\nthere was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment\\non his sidebut no love\\n\\nalas there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with mr knightley\\ntwo days of joyful security were immediately followed by the\\noverthrow of every thing  a letter arrived from mr churchill\\nto urge his nephews instant return  mrs churchill was unwell\\nfar too unwell to do without him she had been in a very suffering\\nstate so said her husband when writing to her nephew two days before\\nthough from her usual unwillingness to give pain and constant\\nhabit of never thinking of herself she had not mentioned it\\nbut now she was too ill to trifle and must entreat him to set off\\nfor enscombe without delay\\n\\nthe substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note\\nfrom mrs weston instantly  as to his going it was inevitable\\nhe must be gone within a few hours though without feeling any real\\nalarm for his aunt to lessen his repugnance  he knew her illnesses\\nthey never occurred but for her own convenience\\n\\nmrs weston added that he could only allow himself time to\\nhurry to highbury after breakfast and take leave of the few\\nfriends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him\\nand that he might be expected at hartfield very soon\\n\\nthis wretched note was the finale of emmas breakfast  when once\\nit had been read there was no doing any thing but lament\\nand exclaim  the loss of the ballthe loss of the young man\\nand all that the young man might be feelingit was too wretched\\nsuch a delightful evening as it would have beenevery body so happy\\nand she and her partner the happiesti said it would be so\\nwas the only consolation\\n\\nher fathers feelings were quite distinct  he thought principally\\nof mrs churchills illness and wanted to know how she was treated\\nand as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed\\nbut they would all be safer at home\\n\\nemma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared\\nbut if this reflected at all upon his impatience his sorrowful\\nlook and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him\\nhe felt the going away almost too much to speak of it  his dejection\\nwas most evident  he sat really lost in thought for the first\\nfew minutes and when rousing himself it was only to say\\n\\nof all horrid things leavetaking is the worst\\n\\nbut you will come again said emma  this will not be your only\\nvisit to randalls\\n\\nahshaking his headthe uncertainty of when i may be able\\nto returni shall try for it with a zealit will be the object\\nof all my thoughts and caresand if my uncle and aunt go to town\\nthis springbut i am afraidthey did not stir last

destroyed by preparation\\nfoolish preparationyou told us it would be sooh  miss woodhouse\\nwhy are you always so right\\n\\nindeed i am very sorry to be right in this instance  i would\\nmuch rather have been merry than wise\\n\\nif i can come again we are still to have our ball  my father\\ndepends on it  do not forget your engagement\\n\\nemma looked graciously\\n\\nsuch a fortnight as it has been he continued every day more\\nprecious and more delightful than the day beforeevery day making\\nme less fit to bear any other place  happy those who can remain\\nat highbury\\n\\nas you do us such ample justice now said emma laughing i will\\nventure to ask whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first\\ndo not we rather surpass your expectations  i am sure we do\\ni am sure you did not much expect to like us  you would not have been\\nso long in coming if you had had a pleasant idea of highbury\\n\\nhe laughed rather consciously and though denying the sentiment\\nemma was convinced that it had been so\\n\\nand you must be off this very morning\\n\\nyes my father is to join me here  we shall walk back together\\nand i must be off immediately  i am almost afraid that every moment\\nwill bring him\\n\\nnot five minutes to spare even for your friends miss fairfax and\\nmiss bates  how unlucky  miss batess powerful argumentative mind\\nmight have strengthened yours\\n\\nyesi have called there passing the door i thought it better\\nit was a right thing to do  i went in for three minutes and was\\ndetained by miss batess being absent  she was out and i felt it\\nimpossible not to wait till she came in  she is a woman that one may\\nthat one must laugh at but that one would not wish to slight\\nit was better to pay my visit then\\n\\nhe hesitated got up walked to a window\\n\\nin short said he perhaps miss woodhousei think you can\\nhardly be quite without suspicion\\n\\nhe looked at her as if wanting to read her thoughts  she hardly\\nknew what to say  it seemed like the forerunner of something\\nabsolutely serious which she did not wish  forcing herself\\nto speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said\\n\\nyou are quite in the right it was most natural to pay your visit then\\n\\nhe was silent  she believed he was looking at her probably reflecting\\non what she had said and trying to understand the manner\\nshe heard him sigh  it was natural for him to feel that he had\\ncause to sigh  he could not believe her to be encouraging him\\na few awkward moments passed and he sat down again and in a more\\ndetermined manner said\\n\\nit was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be\\ngiven to hartfield  my regard for hartfield is most warm\\n\\nhe stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed\\nhe was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say\\nhow it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance\\nmr woodhouse soon followed and the necessity of exertion made\\nhim composed\\n\\na very few minutes more however completed the present trial\\nmr weston always alert when business was to be done and as\\nincapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable\\nas of foreseeing any that was doubtful said it was time to go\\nand the young man though he might and did sigh could not but agree\\nto take leave\\n\\ni shall hear about you all said he that is my chief consolation\\ni shall hear of every thing that is going on among you  i have\\nengaged mrs weston to correspond with me  she has been so kind as\\nto promise it  oh the blessing of a female correspondent when one\\nis really interested in the absentshe will tell me every thing\\nin her letters i shall be at dear highbury again\\n\\na very friendly shake of the hand a very earnest goodbye\\nclosed the speech and the door had soon shut out frank churchill\\nshort had been the noticeshort their meeting he was gone and emma\\nfelt so sorry to part and foresaw so great a loss to their little\\nsociety from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry\\nand feeling it too much\\n\\nit was a sad change  they had been meeting almost every day\\nsince his arrival  certainly his being at randalls had given\\ngreat spirit to the last two weeksindescribable spirit the idea\\nthe expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought\\nthe assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners\\nit had been a very happy fortnight and forlorn must be the sinking\\nfrom it into the common course of hartfield days  to complete every\\nother recommendation he had almost told her that he loved her\\nwhat strength or what constancy of affection he might be subject to\\nwas another point but at present she could not doubt his having\\na decidedly warm admiration a conscious preference of herself\\nand this persuasion joined to all the rest made her think that\\nshe must be a little in love with him in spite of every previous\\ndetermination against it\\n\\ni certainly must said she  this sensation of listlessness\\nweariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself\\nthis feeling of every things being dull and insipid about the house\\ni must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i\\nwere notfor a few weeks at least  well evil to some is always\\ngood to others  i shall have many fellowmourners for the ball\\nif not for frank churchill but mr knightley will be happy\\nhe may spend the evening with his dear william larkins now if he likes\\n\\nmr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness  he could\\nnot say that he was sorry on his own account his very cheerful look\\nwould have contradicted him if he had but he said and very steadily\\nthat he was sorry for the disappointment of the others and with\\nconsiderable kindness added\\n\\nyou emma who have so few opportunities of dancing you are really\\nout of luck you are very much out of luck\\n\\nit was some days before she saw jane fairfax to judge of her\\nhonest regret in this woeful change but when they did meet\\nher composure was odious  she had been particularly unwell however\\nsuffering from headache to a degree which made her aunt declare\\nthat had the ball taken place she did not think jane could have\\nattended it and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming\\nindifference to the languor of illhealth\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiii\\n\\n\\nemma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love  her ideas\\nonly varied as to the how much  at first she thought it was a good deal\\nand afterwards but little  she had great pleasure in hearing frank\\nchurchill talked of and for his sake greater pleasure than ever\\nin seeing mr and mrs weston she was very often thinking of him\\nand quite impatient for a letter that she might know how he was\\nhow were his spirits how was his aunt and what was the chance\\nof his coming to randalls again this spring  but on the other hand\\nshe could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the\\nfirst morning to be less disposed for employment than usual\\nshe was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could\\nyet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him\\nso much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand\\namusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment\\nfancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters\\nthe conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she\\nrefused him  their affection was always to subside into friendship\\nevery thing tender and charming was to mark their parting\\nbut still they were to part  when she became sensible of this\\nit struck her that she could not be very much in love for in spite\\nof her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father\\nnever to marry a strong attachment certainly must produce more\\nof a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings\\n\\ni do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice said she\\nin not one of all my clever replies my delicate negatives\\nis there any allusion to making a sacrifice  i do suspect that he\\nis not really necessary to my happiness  so much the better\\ni certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than i do  i am\\nquite enough in love  i should be sorry to be more\\n\\nupon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings\\n\\nhe is undoubtedly very much in loveevery thing denotes itvery much\\nin love indeedand when he comes again if his affection continue\\ni must be on my guard not to encourage itit would be most\\ninexcusable to do otherwise as my own mind is quite made up\\nnot that i imagine he can think i have been encouraging him hitherto\\nno if he had believed me at all to share his feelings he would\\nnot have been so wretched  could he have thought himself encouraged\\nhis looks and language at parting would have been different\\nstill however i must be on my guard  this is in the supposition\\nof his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i\\nexpect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man\\ni do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy\\nhis feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable\\nevery consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful\\nthat my happiness is not more deeply involvedi shall do very well\\nagain after a little whileand then it will be a good thing over\\nfor they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall\\nhave been let off easily\\n\\nwhen his letter to mrs weston arrived emma had the perusal of it\\nand she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made\\nher at first shake her head over her own sensations and think she\\nhad undervalued their strength  it was a long wellwritten letter\\ngiving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings\\nexpressing all the affection gratitude and respect which was\\nnatural and honourable and describing every thing exterior and local\\nthat could be supposed attractive with spirit and precision\\nno suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern it was the\\nlanguage of real feeling towards mrs weston and the transition\\nfrom highbury to enscombe the contrast between the places in some\\nof the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on\\nto shew how keenly it was felt and how much more might have been\\nsaid but for the restraints of proprietythe charm of her own\\nname was not wanting  miss woodhouse appeared more than once\\nand never without a something of pleasing connexion either a\\ncompliment to her taste or a remembrance of what she had said\\nand in the very last time of its meeting her eye unadorned as it\\nwas by any such broad wreath of gallantry she yet could discern\\nthe effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment\\nperhaps of all conveyed  compressed into the very lowest vacant\\ncorner were these wordsi had not a spare moment on tuesday\\nas you know for miss woodhouses beautiful little friend  pray make\\nmy excuses and adieus to her  this emma could not doubt was all\\nfor herself  harriet was remembered only from being her friend\\nhis information and prospects as to enscombe were neither worse nor\\nbetter than had been anticipated mrs churchill was recovering\\nand he dared not yet even in his own imagination fix a time for\\ncoming to randalls again\\n\\ngratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the\\nmaterial part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up\\nand returned to mrs weston that it had not added any lasting warmth\\nthat she could still do without the writer and that he must learn\\nto do without her  her intentions were unchanged  her resolution\\nof refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for\\nhis subsequent consolation and happiness  his recollection of harriet\\nand the words which clothed it the beautiful little friend\\nsuggested to her the idea of harriets succeeding her in his affections\\nwas it impossiblenoharriet undoubtedly was greatly his\\ninferior in understanding but he had been very much struck with\\nthe loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner\\nand all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in\\nher favourfor harriet it would be advantageous and delightful indeed\\n\\ni must not dwell upon it said shei must not think of it\\ni know the danger of indulging such speculations  but stranger\\nthings have happened and when we cease to care for each other\\nas we do now it will be the means of confirming us in that sort\\nof true disinterested friendship which i can already look forward\\nto with pleasure\\n\\nit was well to have a comfort in store on harriets behalf\\nthough it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom for evil\\nin that quarter was at hand  as frank churchills arrival had\\nsucceeded mr eltons engagement in the conversation of highbury\\nas the latest interest had entirely borne down the first so now\\nupon frank churchills disappearance mr eltons concerns were\\nassuming the most irresistible formhis weddingday was named\\nhe would soon be among them again mr elton and his bride\\nthere was hardly time to talk over the first letter from enscombe\\nbefore mr elton and his bride was in every bodys mouth\\nand frank churchill was forgotten  emma grew sick at the sound\\nshe had had three weeks of happy exemption from mr elton\\nand harriets mind she had been willing to hope had been lately\\ngaining strength  with mr westons ball in view at least\\nthere had been a great deal of insensibility to other things\\nbut it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state\\nof composure as could stand against the actual approachnew carriage\\nbellringing and all\\n\\npoor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\\nreasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma\\ncould give  emma felt that she could not do too much for her\\nthat harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience\\nbut it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing\\nany effect for ever agreed to without being able to make their opinions\\nthe same  harriet listened submissively and said it was very true\\nit was just as miss woodhouse describedit was not worth while to\\nthink about themand she would not think about them any longer\\nbut no change of subject could avail and the next halfhour\\nsaw her as anxious and restless about the eltons as before\\nat last emma attacked her on another ground\\n\\nyour allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about\\nmr eltons marrying harriet is the strongest reproach you can\\nmake me  you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i\\nfell into  it was all my doing i know  i have not forgotten it\\ni assure youdeceived myself i did very miserably deceive you\\nand it will be a painful reflection to me for ever  do not imagine\\nme in danger of forgetting it\\n\\nharriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words\\nof eager exclamation  emma continued\\n\\ni have not said exert yourself harriet for my sake think less\\ntalk less of mr elton for my sake because for your own sake rather\\ni would wish it to be done for the sake of what is more important\\nthan my comfort a habit of selfcommand in you a consideration\\nof what is your duty an attention to propriety an endeavour\\nto avoid the suspicions of others to save your health and credit\\nand restore your tranquillity  these are the motives which i\\nhave been pressing on you  they are very importantand sorry\\ni am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them\\nmy being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration  i want\\nyou to save yourself from greater pain  perhaps i may sometimes\\nhave felt that harriet would not forget what was dueor rather\\nwhat would be kind by me\\n\\nthis appeal to her affections did more than all the rest\\nthe idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for miss woodhouse\\nwhom she really loved extremely made her wretched for a while\\nand when the violence of grief was comforted away still remained\\npowerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it\\nvery tolerably\\n\\nyou who have been the best friend i ever had in my life\\nwant gratitude to younobody is equal to youi care for nobody\\nas i do for youoh  miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been\\n\\nsuch expressions assisted as they were by every thing that look\\nand manner could do made emma feel that she had never loved harriet\\nso well nor valued her affection so highly before\\n\\nthere is no charm equal to tenderness of heart said she\\nafterwards to herself  there is nothing to be compared to it\\nwarmth and tenderness of heart with an affectionate open manner\\nwill beat all the clearness of head in the world for attraction\\ni am sure it will  it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear\\nfather so generally belovedwhich gives isabella all her

clearestheaded\\nlongestsighted bestjudging female breathing  oh the coldness\\nof a jane fairfaxharriet is worth a hundred suchand for a wife\\na sensible mans wifeit is invaluable  i mention no names\\nbut happy the man who changes emma for harriet\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xiv\\n\\n\\nmrs elton was first seen at church  but though devotion might\\nbe interrupted curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew\\nand it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid\\nto settle whether she were very pretty indeed or only rather pretty\\nor not pretty at all\\n\\nemma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety\\nto make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects\\nand she made a point of harriets going with her that the worst of\\nthe business might be gone through as soon as possible\\n\\nshe could not enter the house again could not be in the same room\\nto which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago\\nto lace up her boot without recollecting  a thousand vexatious\\nthoughts would recur  compliments charades and horrible blunders\\nand it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be\\nrecollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather\\npale and silent  the visit was of course short and there was so\\nmuch embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that emma\\nwould not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady\\nand on no account to give one beyond the nothingmeaning terms\\nof being elegantly dressed and very pleasing\\n\\nshe did not really like her  she would not be in a hurry to find fault\\nbut she suspected that there was no eleganceease but not elegance\\nshe was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride\\nthere was too much ease  her person was rather good her face\\nnot unpretty but neither feature nor air nor voice nor manner\\nwere elegant  emma thought at least it would turn out so\\n\\nas for mr elton his manners did not appearbut no she would\\nnot permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners\\nit was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits\\nand a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it\\nthe woman was better off she might have the assistance of fine clothes\\nand the privilege of bashfulness but the man had only his own\\ngood sense to depend on and when she considered how peculiarly\\nunlucky poor mr elton was in being in the same room at once with\\nthe woman he had just married the woman he had wanted to marry\\nand the woman whom he had been expected to marry she must allow him\\nto have the right to look as little wise and to be as much affectedly\\nand as little really easy as could be\\n\\nwell miss woodhouse said harriet when they had quitted\\nthe house and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin\\nwell miss woodhouse with a gentle sigh what do you think of her\\nis not she very charming\\n\\nthere was a little hesitation in emmas answer\\n\\noh yesverya very pleasing young woman\\n\\ni think her beautiful quite beautiful\\n\\nvery nicely dressed indeed a remarkably elegant gown\\n\\ni am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love\\n\\noh nothere is nothing to surprize one at alla pretty fortune\\nand she came in his way\\n\\ni dare say returned harriet sighing again i dare say she\\nwas very much attached to him\\n\\nperhaps she might but it is not every mans fate to marry the\\nwoman who loves him best  miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home\\nand thought this the best offer she was likely to have\\n\\nyes said harriet earnestly and well she might nobody could ever\\nhave a better  well i wish them happy with all my heart  and now\\nmiss woodhouse i do not think i shall mind seeing them again\\nhe is just as superior as everbut being married you know\\nit is quite a different thing  no indeed miss woodhouse you need\\nnot be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery\\nto know that he has not thrown himself away is such a comfort\\nshe does seem a charming young woman just what he deserves\\nhappy creature  he called her augusta  how delightful\\n\\nwhen the visit was returned emma made up her mind  she could then\\nsee more and judge better  from harriets happening not to be\\nat hartfield and her fathers being present to engage mr elton\\nshe had a quarter of an hour of the ladys conversation to herself\\nand could composedly attend to her and the quarter of an hour quite\\nconvinced her that mrs elton was a vain woman extremely well\\nsatisfied with herself and thinking much of her own importance\\nthat she meant to shine and be very superior but with manners which\\nhad been formed in a bad school pert and familiar that all her\\nnotions were drawn from one set of people and one style of living\\nthat if not foolish she was ignorant and that her society would\\ncertainly do mr elton no good\\n\\nharriet would have been a better match  if not wise or refined herself\\nshe would have connected him with those who were but miss hawkins\\nit might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit had been the best\\nof her own set  the rich brotherinlaw near bristol was the pride\\nof the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride\\nof him\\n\\nthe very first subject after being seated was maple grove my brother\\nmr sucklings seata comparison of hartfield to maple grove\\nthe grounds of hartfield were small but neat and pretty and the\\nhouse was modern and wellbuilt mrs elton seemed most favourably\\nimpressed by the size of the room the entrance and all that she\\ncould see or imagine  very like maple grove indeedshe was quite\\nstruck by the likenessthat room was the very shape and size\\nof the morningroom at maple grove her sisters favourite room\\nmr elton was appealed towas not it astonishingly like\\nshe could really almost fancy herself at maple grove\\n\\nand the staircaseyou know as i came in i observed how very like\\nthe staircase was placed exactly in the same part of the house\\ni really could not help exclaiming  i assure you miss woodhouse\\nit is very delightful to me to be reminded of a place i am so\\nextremely partial to as maple grove  i have spent so many happy\\nmonths there with a little sigh of sentiment a charming place\\nundoubtedly  every body who sees it is struck by its beauty\\nbut to me it has been quite a home  whenever you are transplanted\\nlike me miss woodhouse you will understand how very delightful it\\nis to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind\\ni always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony\\n\\nemma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient\\nfor mrs elton who only wanted to be talking herself\\n\\nso extremely like maple grove  and it is not merely the house\\nthe grounds i assure you as far as i could observe are strikingly\\nlike  the laurels at maple grove are in the same profusion as here\\nand stand very much in the same wayjust across the lawn\\nand i had a glimpse of a fine large tree with a bench round it\\nwhich put me so exactly in mind  my brother and sister will be\\nenchanted with this place  people who have extensive grounds\\nthemselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style\\n\\nemma doubted the truth of this sentiment  she had a great idea\\nthat people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little\\nfor the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth\\nwhile to attack an error so doubledyed and therefore only said\\nin reply\\n\\nwhen you have seen more of this country i am afraid you will think\\nyou have overrated hartfield  surry is full of beauties\\n\\noh yes i am quite aware of that  it is the garden of england\\nyou know  surry is the garden of england\\n\\nyes but we must not rest our claims on that distinction\\nmany counties i believe are called the garden of england\\nas well as surry\\n\\nno i fancy not replied mrs elton with a most satisfied smile\\ni never heard any county but surry called so\\n\\nemma was silenced\\n\\nmy brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring\\nor summer at farthest continued mrs elton and that will be\\nour time for exploring  while they are with us we shall explore\\na great deal i dare say  they will have their barouchelandau\\nof course which holds four perfectly and therefore without saying\\nany thing of our carriage we should be able to explore the different\\nbeauties extremely well  they would hardly come in their chaise\\ni think at that season of the year  indeed when the time draws on\\ni shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouchelandau\\nit will be so very much preferable  when people come into a beautiful\\ncountry of this sort you know miss woodhouse one naturally wishes\\nthem to see as much as possible and mr suckling is extremely fond\\nof exploring  we explored to kingsweston twice last summer\\nin that way most delightfully just after their first having the\\nbarouchelandau  you have many parties of that kind here i suppose\\nmiss woodhouse every summer\\n\\nno not immediately here  we are rather out of distance of the very\\nstriking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of\\nand we are a very quiet set of people i believe more disposed\\nto stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure\\n\\nah there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort\\nnobody can be more devoted to home than i am  i was quite\\na proverb for it at maple grove  many a time has selina said\\nwhen she has been going to bristol i really cannot get this girl\\nto move from the house  i absolutely must go in by myself though i\\nhate being stuck up in the barouchelandau without a companion\\nbut augusta i believe with her own goodwill would never stir\\nbeyond the park paling  many a time has she said so and yet i\\nam no advocate for entire seclusion  i think on the contrary\\nwhen people shut themselves up entirely from society it is a very\\nbad thing and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\\na proper degree without living in it either too much or too little\\ni perfectly understand your situation however miss woodhouse\\nlooking towards mr woodhouse your fathers state of health must\\nbe a great drawback  why does not he try bathindeed he should\\nlet me recommend bath to you  i assure you i have no doubt of its doing\\nmr woodhouse good\\n\\nmy father tried it more than once formerly but without receiving\\nany benefit and mr perry whose name i dare say is not unknown\\nto you does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be\\nuseful now\\n\\nah thats a great pity for i assure you miss woodhouse\\nwhere the waters do agree it is quite wonderful the relief\\nthey give  in my bath life i have seen such instances of it\\nand it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of\\nuse to mr woodhouses spirits which i understand are sometimes\\nmuch depressed  and as to its recommendations to you i fancy i\\nneed not take much pains to dwell on them  the advantages of bath\\nto the young are pretty generally understood  it would be a charming\\nintroduction for you who have lived so secluded a life and i could\\nimmediately secure you some of the best society in the place\\na line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance and my\\nparticular friend mrs partridge the lady i have always resided\\nwith when in bath would be most happy to shew you any attentions\\nand would be the very person for you to go into public with\\n\\nit was as much as emma could bear without being impolite\\nthe idea of her being indebted to mrs elton for what was called\\nan introductionof her going into public under the auspices\\nof a friend of mrs eltonsprobably some vulgar dashing widow\\nwho with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live\\nthe dignity of miss woodhouse of hartfield was sunk indeed\\n\\nshe restrained herself however from any of the reproofs she could\\nhave given and only thanked mrs elton coolly but their going\\nto bath was quite out of the question and she was not perfectly\\nconvinced that the place might suit her better than her father\\nand then to prevent farther outrage and indignation changed the\\nsubject directly\\n\\ni do not ask whether you are musical mrs elton  upon these occasions\\na ladys character generally precedes her and highbury has long\\nknown that you are a superior performer\\n\\noh no indeed i must protest against any such idea\\na superior performervery far from it i assure you\\nconsider from how partial a quarter your information came\\ni am doatingly fond of musicpassionately fondand my friends\\nsay i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else\\nupon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree\\nyou miss woodhouse i well know play delightfully  i assure you\\nit has been the greatest satisfaction comfort and delight to me\\nto hear what a musical society i am got into  i absolutely cannot\\ndo without music  it is a necessary of life to me and having always\\nbeen used to a very musical society both at maple grove and in bath\\nit would have been a most serious sacrifice  i honestly said as much\\nto mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing\\nhis fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable\\nand the inferiority of the house tooknowing what i had been\\naccustomed toof course he was not wholly without apprehension\\nwhen he was speaking of it in that way i honestly said that the\\nworld i could give upparties balls playsfor i had no fear\\nof retirement  blessed with so many resources within myself\\nthe world was not necessary to me  i could do very well without it\\nto those who had no resources it was a different thing but my\\nresources made me quite independent  and as to smallersized rooms\\nthan i had been used to i really could not give it a thought\\ni hoped i was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description\\ncertainly i had been accustomed to every luxury at maple grove but i\\ndid assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness\\nnor were spacious apartments  but said i to be quite honest\\ni do not think i can live without something of a musical society\\ni condition for nothing else but without music life would be a blank\\nto me\\n\\nwe cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr elton would hesitate\\nto assure you of there being a very musical society in highbury\\nand i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than\\nmay be pardoned in consideration of the motive\\n\\nno indeed i have no doubts at all on that head  i am delighted\\nto find myself in such a circle  i hope we shall have many sweet\\nlittle concerts together  i think miss woodhouse you and i\\nmust establish a musical club and have regular weekly meetings\\nat your house or ours  will not it be a good plan  if we\\nexert ourselves i think we shall not be long in want of allies\\nsomething of that nature would be particularly desirable for me\\nas an inducement to keep me in practice for married women you know\\nthere is a sad story against them in general  they are but too apt\\nto give up music\\n\\nbut you who are so extremely fond of itthere can\\nbe no danger surely\\n\\ni should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance\\ni tremble  selina has entirely given up musicnever touches\\nthe instrumentthough she played sweetly  and the same may be said\\nof mrs jeffereysclara partridge that wasand of the two milmans\\nnow mrs bird and mrs james cooper and of more than i can enumerate\\nupon my word it is enough to put one in a fright  i used to be\\nquite angry with selina but really i begin now to comprehend\\nthat a married woman has many things to call her attention\\ni believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper\\n\\nbut every thing of that kind said emma will soon\\nbe in so regular a train\\n\\nwell said mrs elton laughing we shall see\\n\\nemma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music\\nhad nothing more to say and after a moments pause mrs elton\\nchose another subject\\n\\nwe have been calling at randalls said she and found them\\nboth at home and very pleasant people they seem to be\\ni like them extremely  mr weston seems an excellent creature\\nquite a firstrate favourite with me already i assure you\\nand she appears so truly goodthere is something so motherly\\nand kindhearted about her that it wins upon one directly\\nshe was your governess i think\\n\\nemma was almost too much astonished to answer but mrs elton\\nhardly waited for the affirmative before she went on\\n\\nhaving understood as much i was rather astonished to find her\\nso very ladylike  but she is really quite the gentlewoman\\n\\nmrs westons manners said emma were always particularly good\\ntheir propriety simplicity and elegance would make them the safest\\nmodel for any young woman\\n\\nand who do you think came in while we were there\\n\\nemma was quite at a loss  the tone implied some old acquaintance\\nand how could she possibly guess\\n\\nknightley continued mrs elton knightley himselfwas not\\nit luckyfor not being within when he called the other day\\ni had never seen him before and of course as so particular a\\nfriend of mr es i had a great curiosity  my friend knightley\\nhad been so often mentioned that i was really impatient to see him\\nand i must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not\\nbe ashamed of his friend  knightley is quite the gentleman\\ni like him very much  decidedly i think a very gentlemanlike man\\n\\nhappily it was now time to be gone  they were off and emma\\ncould breathe\\n\\ninsufferable woman was her immediate exclamation  worse than i\\nhad supposed  absolutely insufferable  knightleyi could not\\nhave believed it  knightleynever seen him in her life before\\nand call him knightleyand discover that he is a gentleman\\na little upstart vulgar being with her mr e and her caro sposo\\nand her resources and all her airs of pert pretension and\\nunderbred finery  actually to discover that mr knightley is\\na gentleman  i doubt whether he will return the compliment\\nand discover her to be a lady  i could not have believed it\\nand to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club\\none would fancy we were bosom friends  and mrs weston\\nastonished that the person who had brought me up should be\\na gentlewoman  worse and worse  i never met with her equal\\nmuch beyond my hopes  harriet is disgraced by any comparison\\noh what would frank churchill say to her if he were here\\nhow angry and how diverted he would be  ah there i am\\nthinking of him directly  always the first person to be thought of\\nhow i catch myself out  frank churchill comes as regularly into\\nmy mind\\n\\nall this ran so glibly through her thoughts that by the time\\nher father had arranged himself after the bustle of the eltons\\ndeparture and was ready to speak she was very tolerably capable\\nof attending\\n\\nwell my dear he deliberately began considering we never saw\\nher before she seems a very pretty sort of young lady and i dare say\\nshe was very much pleased with you  she speaks a little too quick\\na little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear\\nbut i believe i am nice i do not like strange voices and nobody speaks\\nlike you and poor miss taylor  however she seems a very obliging\\nprettybehaved young lady and no doubt will make him a very good wife\\nthough i think he had better not have married  i made the best\\nexcuses i could for not having been able to wait on him and mrs elton\\non this happy occasion i said that i hoped i should in the course\\nof the summer  but i ought to have gone before  not to wait upon\\na bride is very remiss  ah it shews what a sad invalid i am\\nbut i do not like the corner into vicarage lane\\n\\ni dare say your apologies were accepted sir  mr elton knows you\\n\\nyes  but a young ladya bridei ought to have paid my respects\\nto her if possible  it was being very deficient\\n\\nbut my dear papa you are no friend to matrimony and therefore\\nwhy should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride\\nit ought to be no recommendation to you  it is encouraging people\\nto marry if you make so much of them\\n\\nno my dear i never encouraged any body to marry but i would\\nalways wish to pay every proper attention to a ladyand a bride\\nespecially is never to be neglected  more is avowedly due to her\\na bride you know my dear is always the first in company\\nlet the others be who they may\\n\\nwell papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know\\nwhat is  and i should never have expected you to be lending your\\nsanction to such vanitybaits for poor young ladies\\n\\nmy dear you do not understand me  this is a\\nmatter of mere common politeness and goodbreeding\\nand has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry\\n\\nemma had done  her father was growing nervous and could not\\nunderstand her  her mind returned to mrs eltons offences\\nand long very long did they occupy her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xv\\n\\n\\nemma was not required by any subsequent discovery to retract her ill\\nopinion of mrs elton  her observation had been pretty correct\\nsuch as mrs elton appeared to her on this second interview\\nsuch she appeared whenever they met againselfimportant presuming\\nfamiliar ignorant and illbred she had a little beauty and a\\nlittle accomplishment but so little judgment that she thought herself\\ncoming with superior knowledge of the world to enliven and improve\\na country neighbourhood and conceived miss hawkins to have held\\nsuch a place in society as mrs eltons

following the lead of miss batess\\ngoodwill or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever\\nand as agreeable as she professed herself were very well satisfied\\nso that mrs eltons praise passed from one mouth to another as it\\nought to do unimpeded by miss woodhouse who readily continued her\\nfirst contribution and talked with a good grace of her being very\\npleasant and very elegantly dressed\\n\\nin one respect mrs elton grew even worse than she had appeared\\nat first  her feelings altered towards emmaoffended probably\\nby the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with\\nshe drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold\\nand distant and though the effect was agreeable the illwill\\nwhich produced it was necessarily increasing emmas dislike\\nher manners tooand mr eltons were unpleasant towards harriet\\nthey were sneering and negligent  emma hoped it must rapidly work\\nharriets cure but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour\\nsunk them both very muchit was not to be doubted that poor\\nharriets attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve\\nand her own share in the story under a colouring the least favourable\\nto her and the most soothing to him had in all likelihood been\\ngiven also  she was of course the object of their joint dislike\\nwhen they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin\\nabusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew\\nin open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous\\ntreatment of harriet\\n\\nmrs elton took a great fancy to jane fairfax and from the first\\nnot merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be\\nsupposed to recommend the other but from the very first and she\\nwas not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration\\nbut without solicitation or plea or privilege she must be wanting\\nto assist and befriend herbefore emma had forfeited her confidence\\nand about the third time of their meeting she heard all mrs eltons\\nknighterrantry on the subject\\n\\njane fairfax is absolutely charming miss woodhousei quite\\nrave about jane fairfaxa sweet interesting creature  so mild\\nand ladylikeand with such talentsi assure you i think she\\nhas very extraordinary talents  i do not scruple to say that she\\nplays extremely well  i know enough of music to speak decidedly\\non that point  oh she is absolutely charming  you will laugh at\\nmy warmthbut upon my word i talk of nothing but jane fairfax\\nand her situation is so calculated to affect onemiss

fairfax\\n\\ni cannot think there is any danger of it was emmas calm answer\\nand when you are better acquainted with miss fairfaxs situation\\nand understand what her home has been with colonel and mrs campbell\\ni have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown\\n\\noh but dear miss woodhouse she is now in such retirement\\nsuch obscurity so thrown awaywhatever advantages she may have\\nenjoyed with the campbells are so palpably at an end  and i think\\nshe feels it  i am sure she does  she is very timid and silent\\none can see that she feels the want of encouragement  i like her\\nthe better for it  i must confess it is a recommendation to me\\ni am a great advocate for timidityand i am sure one does\\nnot often meet with itbut in those who are at all inferior\\nit is extremely prepossessing  oh  i assure you jane fairfax\\nis a very delightful character and interests me more than i\\ncan express\\n\\nyou appear to feel a great dealbut i am not aware how you or any\\nof miss fairfaxs acquaintance here any of those who have known\\nher longer than yourself can shew her any other attention than\\n\\nmy dear miss woodhouse a vast deal may be done by those who dare\\nto act  you and i need not be afraid  if we set the example\\nmany will follow it as far as they can though all have not\\nour situations  we have carriages to fetch and convey her home\\nand we live in a style which could not make the addition of\\njane fairfax at any time the least inconvenienti should be\\nextremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner\\nas could make me regret having asked more than jane fairfax\\nto partake of it  i have no idea of that sort of thing  it is\\nnot likely that i should considering what i have been used to\\nmy greatest danger perhaps in housekeeping may be quite the\\nother way in doing too much and being too careless of expense\\nmaple grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be\\nfor we do not at all affect to equal my brother mr suckling\\nin incomehowever my resolution is taken as to noticing jane fairfax\\ni shall certainly have her very often at my house shall introduce\\nher wherever i can shall have musical parties to draw out her talents\\nand shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation\\nmy acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt\\nof hearing of something to suit her shortlyi shall introduce her\\nof course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come\\nto us  i am sure they will like her extremely and when she gets\\na little acquainted with them her fears will completely wear off\\nfor there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is\\nhighly conciliatingi shall have her very often indeed while they\\nare with me and i dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in\\nthe barouchelandau in some of our exploring parties\\n\\npoor jane fairfaxthought emmayou have not deserved this\\nyou may have done wrong with

to herselfso disgustingly decorated with a dear miss\\nwoodhouse  the change on mrs eltons side soon afterwards appeared\\nand she was left in peaceneither forced to be the very particular\\nfriend of

looked on with some amusementmiss batess gratitude for\\nmrs eltons attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless\\nsimplicity and warmth  she was quite one of her worthies\\nthe most amiable

as she seemed to do\\nshe heard of her walking with the eltons sitting with the eltons\\nspending a day with the eltons  this was astonishingshe could not\\nhave believed it possible that the taste or

such real generous affection\\n\\njane had come to highbury professedly for three months the campbells\\nwere gone to ireland for three months but now the campbells\\nhad promised their daughter to stay at least till midsummer\\nand fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there\\naccording to miss batesit all came from hermrs dixon had\\nwritten most pressingly  would jane but go

somewhere\\nshe is not to be with the dixons  the decree is issued by somebody\\nbut why must she consent to be with the eltonshere is quite a\\nseparate puzzle\\n\\nupon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject\\nbefore the few who knew her opinion of mrs elton mrs weston\\nventured this apology for jane\\n\\nwe cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the vicarage\\nmy dear emmabut it is better than being always at home\\nher aunt is a good creature but as a constant companion\\nmust be very tiresome  we must consider what miss fairfax quits\\nbefore we condemn her taste for what she goes to\\n\\nyou are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax\\nis as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton\\ncould she have chosen with whom to associate she would not have\\nchosen her  but with a reproachful smile at emma she receives\\nattentions from mrs elton which nobody else pays her\\n\\nemma felt that mrs weston was giving her a momentary glance\\nand she was herself struck by his warmth  with a faint blush\\nshe presently replied\\n\\nsuch attentions as mrs eltons i should have imagined\\nwould rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax  mrs eltons\\ninvitations i should have imagined any thing but inviting\\n\\ni should not wonder said mrs weston if miss fairfax were to have\\nbeen drawn on beyond her own inclination by her aunts eagerness\\nin accepting mrs eltons civilities for her  poor miss bates may\\nvery likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\\nappearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated\\nin spite of the very natural wish of a little change\\n\\nboth felt rather anxious to hear him speak again and after a few\\nminutes silence he said\\n\\nanother thing must be taken into consideration toomrs elton\\ndoes not talk to miss fairfax as she speaks of her  we all know\\nthe difference between the pronouns he or she and thou the plainest\\nspoken amongst us we all feel the influence of a something beyond\\ncommon civility in our personal intercourse with each other\\na something more early implanted  we cannot give any body the\\ndisagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before\\nwe feel things differently  and besides the operation of this\\nas a general principle you may be sure that miss fairfax awes\\nmrs elton by her superiority both of mind and manner and that\\nface to face mrs elton treats her with all the respect which she\\nhas a claim to  such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell\\nin mrs eltons way beforeand no degree of vanity can prevent\\nher acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not\\nin consciousness\\n\\ni know how highly you think of jane fairfax said emma\\nlittle henry was in her thoughts and a mixture of alarm and delicacy\\nmade her irresolute what else to say\\n\\nyes he replied any body may know how highly i think of her\\n\\nand yet said emma beginning hastily and with an arch look\\nbut soon stoppingit was better however to know the worst at once\\nshe hurried onand yet perhaps you may hardly be aware yourself\\nhow highly it is  the extent of your admiration may take you by\\nsurprize some day or other\\n\\nmr knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\\nleather gaiters and either the exertion of getting them together\\nor some other cause brought the colour into his face as he answered\\n\\noh are you therebut you are miserably behindhand  mr cole\\ngave me a hint of it six weeks ago\\n\\nhe stoppedemma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston and did\\nnot herself know what to think  in a moment he went on\\n\\nthat will never be however i can assure you  miss fairfax\\ni dare say would not have me if i were to ask

you\\n\\nhe seemed hardly to hear her he was thoughtfuland in a manner\\nwhich shewed him not pleased soon afterwards said\\n\\nso you have been settling that i should marry jane fairfax\\n\\nno indeed i have not  you have scolded me too much for matchmaking\\nfor me to presume to take such a liberty with you  what i said\\njust now meant nothing  one says those sort of things of course\\nwithout any idea of a serious meaning  oh no upon my word i have not\\nthe smallest wish for your marrying jane fairfax or jane any body\\nyou would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way\\nif you were married\\n\\nmr knightley was thoughtful again  the result of his reverie was\\nno emma i do not think the extent of my admiration for her will\\never take me by surprizei never had a thought of her in that way\\ni assure you  and soon afterwards jane fairfax is a very charming\\nyoung womanbut not even jane fairfax is perfect  she has a fault\\nshe has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife\\n\\nemma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault\\nwell said she and you soon silenced mr cole i suppose\\n\\nyes very soon  he gave me a quiet hint i told him he was mistaken\\nhe asked my pardon and said no more  cole does not want to be wiser\\nor wittier than his neighbours\\n\\nin that respect how unlike dear mrs elton who wants to be wiser\\nand wittier than all the world  i wonder how she speaks of the coles\\nwhat she calls them  how can she find any appellation for them\\ndeep enough in familiar vulgarity  she calls you knightleywhat can\\nshe do for mr cole  and so i am not to be surprized that jane\\nfairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her\\nmrs weston your argument weighs most with me  i can much more\\nreadily enter into the temptation of getting away from miss bates\\nthan i can believe in the triumph of miss fairfaxs mind over\\nmrs elton  i have no faith in mrs eltons acknowledging herself\\nthe inferior in thought word or deed or in her being under any\\nrestraint beyond her own scanty rule of goodbreeding i cannot\\nimagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\\nwith praise encouragement and offers of service that she will not be\\ncontinually detailing her magnificent intentions from the procuring\\nher a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful\\nexploring parties which are to take place in the barouchelandau\\n\\njane fairfax has feeling said mr knightleyi do not\\naccuse her of want of feeling  her sensibilities i suspect\\nare strongand her temper excellent in its power of forbearance\\npatience selfcontroul but it wants openness  she is reserved\\nmore reserved i think than she used to beand i love an\\nopen temper  notill cole alluded to my supposed attachment\\nit had never entered my head  i saw jane fairfax and conversed with\\nher with admiration and pleasure alwaysbut with no thought beyond\\n\\nwell mrs weston said emma triumphantly when he left them\\nwhat do you say now to mr knightleys marrying jane fairfax\\n\\nwhy really dear emma i say that he is so very much occupied\\nby the idea of not being in love with her that i should not wonder\\nif it were to end in his being so at last  do not beat me\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvi\\n\\n\\nevery body in and about highbury who had ever visited mr elton\\nwas disposed to pay him attention on his marriage  dinnerparties and\\neveningparties were made for him and his lady and invitations\\nflowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending\\nthey were never to have a disengaged day\\n\\ni see how it is said she  i see what a life i am to lead\\namong you  upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated\\nwe really seem quite the fashion  if this is living in the country\\nit is nothing very formidable  from monday next to saturday\\ni assure you we have not a disengaged daya woman with fewer\\nresources than i have need not have been at a loss\\n\\nno invitation came amiss to her  her bath habits made eveningparties\\nperfectly natural to her and maple grove had given her a taste\\nfor dinners  she was a little shocked at the want of two\\ndrawing rooms at the poor attempt at routcakes and there being\\nno ice in the highbury cardparties mrs bates mrs perry\\nmrs goddard and others were a good deal behindhand in knowledge\\nof the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought\\nto be arranged  in the course of the spring she must return their\\ncivilities by one very superior partyin which her cardtables\\nshould be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs\\nin the true styleand more waiters engaged for the evening\\nthan their own establishment could furnish to carry round\\nthe refreshments at exactly the proper hour and in the proper order\\n\\nemma in the meanwhile could not be satisfied without a dinner\\nat hartfield for the eltons  they must not do less than others\\nor she should be exposed to odious suspicions and imagined capable\\nof pitiful resentment  a dinner there must be  after emma had\\ntalked about it for ten minutes mr woodhouse felt no unwillingness\\nand only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom\\nof the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding\\nwho should do it for him\\n\\nthe persons to be invited required little thought  besides the eltons\\nit must be the westons and mr knightley so far it was all of course\\nand it was hardly less inevitable that poor little harriet must\\nbe asked to make the eighthbut this invitation was not given\\nwith equal satisfaction and on many accounts emma was particularly\\npleased by harriets begging to be allowed to decline it\\nshe would rather not be in his company more than she could help\\nshe was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy\\nwife together without feeling uncomfortable  if miss woodhouse\\nwould not be displeased she would rather stay at home\\nit was precisely what emma would have wished had she deemed it\\npossible enough for wishing  she was delighted with the fortitude\\nof her little friendfor fortitude she knew it was in her to give\\nup being in company and stay at home and she could now invite the\\nvery person whom she really wanted to make the eighth jane fairfax\\nsince her last conversation with mrs weston and mr knightley\\nshe was more consciencestricken about jane fairfax than she had\\noften beenmr knightleys words dwelt with her  he had said\\nthat jane fairfax received attentions from mrs elton which nobody\\nelse paid her\\n\\nthis is very true said she at least as far as relates to me\\nwhich was all that was meantand it is very shamefulof the same age\\nand always knowing heri ought to have been more her friend\\nshe will never like me now  i have neglected her too long  but i\\nwill shew her greater attention than i have done\\n\\nevery invitation was successful  they were all disengaged and all happy\\nthe preparatory interest of this dinner however was not yet over\\na circumstance rather unlucky occurred  the two eldest little\\nknightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of\\nsome weeks in the spring and their papa now proposed bringing them\\nand staying one whole day at hartfieldwhich one day would be\\nthe very day of this partyhis professional engagements did\\nnot allow of his being put off but both father and daughter were\\ndisturbed by its happening so  mr woodhouse considered eight\\npersons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear\\nand here would be a ninthand emma apprehended that it would\\nbe a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even\\nto hartfield for fortyeight hours without falling in with a dinnerparty\\n\\nshe comforted her father better than she could comfort herself\\nby representing that though he certainly would make them nine\\nyet he always said so little that the increase of noise would be\\nvery immaterial  she thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself\\nto have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed\\nto her instead of his brother\\n\\nthe event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma\\njohn knightley came but mr weston was unexpectedly summoned to town\\nand must be absent on the very day  he might be able to join them\\nin the evening but certainly not to dinner  mr woodhouse was quite\\nat ease and the seeing him so with the arrival of the little boys\\nand the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate\\nremoved the chief of even emmas vexation\\n\\nthe day came the party were punctually assembled and mr john knightley\\nseemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable\\ninstead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited\\nfor dinner he was talking to miss fairfax  mrs elton as elegant\\nas lace and pearls could make her he looked at in silence\\nwanting only to observe enough for isabellas informationbut miss\\nfairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl and he could\\ntalk to her  he had met her before breakfast as he was returning\\nfrom a walk with his little boys when it had been just beginning\\nto rain  it was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject\\nand he said\\n\\ni hope you did not venture far miss fairfax this morning or i\\nam sure you must have been wetwe scarcely got home in time\\ni hope you turned directly\\n\\ni went only to the postoffice said she and reached home\\nbefore the rain was much  it is my daily errand  i always fetch\\nthe letters when i am here  it saves trouble and is a something\\nto get me out  a walk before breakfast does me good\\n\\nnot a walk in the rain i should imagine\\n\\nno but it did not absolutely rain when i set out\\n\\nmr john knightley smiled and replied\\n\\nthat is to say you chose to have your walk for you were not six\\nyards from your own door when i had the pleasure of meeting you\\nand henry and john had seen more drops than they could count long before\\nthe postoffice has a great charm at one period of our lives\\nwhen you have lived to my age you will begin to think letters are\\nnever worth going through the rain for\\n\\nthere was a little blush and then this answer\\n\\ni must not hope to be ever situated as you are in the midst of\\nevery dearest connexion and therefore i cannot expect that simply\\ngrowing older should make me indifferent about letters\\n\\nindifferent  oh noi never conceived you could become indifferent\\nletters are no matter of indifference they are generally a very\\npositive curse\\n\\nyou are speaking of letters of business mine are letters\\nof friendship\\n\\ni have often thought them the worst of the two replied he coolly\\nbusiness you know may bring money but friendship hardly\\never does\\n\\nah you are not serious now  i know mr john knightley too well\\ni am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as\\nany body  i can easily believe that letters are very little to you\\nmuch less than to me but it is not your being ten years older than\\nmyself which makes the difference it is not age but situation\\nyou have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably\\nnever shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections\\na postoffice i think must always have power to draw me out\\nin worse weather than today\\n\\nwhen i talked of your being altered by time by the progress of years\\nsaid john knightley i meant to imply the change of situation\\nwhich time usually brings  i consider one as including the other\\ntime will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within\\nthe daily circlebut that is not the change i had in view for you\\nas an old friend you will allow me to hope miss fairfax that ten\\nyears hence you may have as many concentrated objects as i have\\n\\nit was kindly said and very far from giving offence  a pleasant\\nthank you seemed meant to laugh it off but a blush a quivering lip\\na tear in the eye shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh\\nher attention was now claimed by mr woodhouse who being\\naccording to his custom on such occasions making the circle of\\nhis guests and paying his particular compliments to the ladies\\nwas ending with herand with all his mildest urbanity said\\n\\ni am very sorry to hear miss fairfax of your being out this\\nmorning in the rain  young ladies should take care of themselves\\nyoung ladies are delicate plants  they should take care of their\\nhealth and their complexion  my dear did you change your stockings\\n\\nyes sir i did indeed and i am very much obliged by your kind\\nsolicitude about me\\n\\nmy dear miss fairfax young ladies are very sure to be cared for\\ni hope your good grandmama and aunt are well  they are some\\nof my very old friends  i wish my health allowed me to be a\\nbetter neighbour  you do us a great deal of honour today i am sure\\nmy daughter and i are both highly sensible of your goodness\\nand have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at hartfield\\n\\nthe kindhearted polite old man might then sit down and feel\\nthat he had done his duty and made every fair lady welcome and easy\\n\\nby this time the walk in the rain had reached mrs elton\\nand her remonstrances now opened upon jane\\n\\nmy dear jane what is this i heargoing to the postoffice\\nin the rainthis must not be i assure youyou sad girl\\nhow could you do such a thingit is a sign i was not there\\nto take care of you\\n\\njane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold\\n\\noh do not tell me  you really are a very sad girl and do not\\nknow how to take care of yourselfto the postoffice indeed\\nmrs weston did you ever hear the like  you and i must positively\\nexert our authority\\n\\nmy advice said mrs weston kindly and persuasively i certainly\\ndo feel tempted to give  miss fairfax you must not run such risks\\nliable as you have been to severe colds indeed you ought\\nto be particularly careful especially at this time of year\\nthe spring i always think requires more than common care\\nbetter wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters\\nthan run the risk of bringing on your cough again  now do not you\\nfeel that you had  yes i am sure you are much too reasonable\\nyou look as if you would not do such a thing again\\n\\noh she shall not do such a thing again eagerly rejoined\\nmrs elton  we will not allow her to do such a thing again\\nand nodding significantlythere must be some arrangement made\\nthere must indeed  i shall speak to mr e the man who fetches\\nour letters every morning one of our men i forget his name\\nshall inquire for yours too and bring them to you  that will obviate\\nall difficulties you know and from us i really think my dear jane\\nyou can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation\\n\\nyou are extremely kind said jane but i cannot give up my\\nearly walk  i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can\\ni must walk somewhere and the postoffice is an object and upon\\nmy word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before\\n\\nmy dear jane say no more about it  the thing is determined\\nthat is laughing affectedly as far as i can presume to determine\\nany thing without the concurrence of my lord and master  you know\\nmrs weston you and i must be cautious how we express ourselves\\nbut i do flatter myself my dear jane that my influence is not entirely\\nworn out  if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore\\nconsider that point as settled\\n\\nexcuse me said jane earnestly i cannot by any means consent\\nto such an arrangement so needlessly troublesome to your servant\\nif the errand were not a pleasure to me it could be done as it\\nalways is when i am not here by my grandmamas\\n\\noh my dear but so much as patty has to doand it is a kindness\\nto employ our men\\n\\njane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead\\nof answering she began speaking again to mr john knightley\\n\\nthe postoffice is a wonderful establishment said she\\nthe regularity and despatch of it  if one thinks of all that it\\nhas to do and all that it does so well it is really astonishing\\n\\nit is certainly very well regulated\\n\\nso seldom that any negligence or blunder appears  so seldom\\nthat a letter among the thousands that are constantly passing\\nabout the kingdom is even carried wrongand not one in a million\\ni suppose actually lost  and when one considers the variety\\nof hands and of bad hands too that are to be deciphered\\nit increases the wonder\\n\\nthe clerks grow expert from habitthey must begin with some\\nquickness of sight and hand and exercise improves them  if you\\nwant any farther explanation continued he smiling they are\\npaid for it  that is the key to a great deal of capacity\\nthe public pays and must be served well\\n\\nthe varieties of handwriting were farther talked of and the usual\\nobservations made\\n\\ni have heard it asserted said john knightley that the same\\nsort of handwriting often prevails in a family and where the\\nsame master teaches it is natural enough  but for that reason\\ni should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females\\nfor boys have very little teaching after an early age and scramble\\ninto any hand they can get  isabella and emma i think do write\\nvery much alike  i have not always known their writing apart\\n\\nyes said his brother hesitatingly there is a likeness\\ni know what you meanbut emmas hand is the strongest\\n\\nisabella and emma both write beautifully said mr woodhouse\\nand always did  and so does poor mrs westonwith half a sigh\\nand half a smile at her\\n\\ni never saw any gentlemans handwritingemma began looking also\\nat mrs weston but stopped on perceiving that mrs weston was\\nattending to some one elseand the pause gave her time to reflect\\nnow how am i going to introduce himam i unequal to speaking\\nhis name at once before all these people  is it necessary\\nfor me to use any roundabout phraseyour yorkshire friend\\nyour correspondent in yorkshirethat would be the way i suppose\\nif i were very badno i can pronounce his name without the\\nsmallest distress  i certainly get better and betternow for it\\n\\nmrs weston was disengaged and emma began againmr frank churchill\\nwrites one of the best gentlemans hands i ever saw\\n\\ni do not admire it said mr knightley  it is too small\\nwants strength  it is like a womans writing\\n\\nthis was not submitted to by either lady  they vindicated him\\nagainst the base aspersion  no it by no means wanted strength\\nit was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong\\nhad not mrs weston any letter about her to produce  no she had\\nheard from him very lately but having answered the letter had put\\nit away\\n\\nif we were in the other room said emma if i had my writingdesk\\ni am sure i could produce a specimen  i have a note of his\\ndo not you remember mrs weston employing him to write for you\\none day\\n\\nhe chose to say he was employed\\n\\nwell well i have that note and can shew it after dinner\\nto convince mr knightley\\n\\noh when a gallant young man like mr frank churchill\\nsaid mr knightley dryly writes to a fair lady like miss woodhouse\\nhe will of course put forth his best\\n\\ndinner was on tablemrs elton before she could be spoken to\\nwas ready and before mr woodhouse had reached her with his request\\nto be allowed to hand her into the diningparlour was saying\\n\\nmust i go first  i really am ashamed of always leading the way\\n\\njanes solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped emma\\nshe had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know\\nwhether the wet walk of this morning had produced any  she suspected\\nthat it had that it would not have been so resolutely encountered\\nbut in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear\\nand that it had not been in vain  she thought there was an air\\nof greater happiness than usuala glow both of complexion and spirits\\n\\nshe could have made an inquiry or two as to the expedition\\nand the expense of the irish mailsit was at her tongues end\\nbut she abstained  she was quite determined not to utter a word\\nthat should hurt jane fairfaxs feelings and they followed\\nthe other ladies out of the room arm in arm with an appearance\\nof goodwill highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvii\\n\\n\\nwhen the ladies returned to the drawingroom after dinner emma found\\nit hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties\\nwith so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did mrs elton\\nengross jane fairfax and slight herself  she and mrs weston were\\nobliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together\\nmrs elton left them no choice  if jane repressed her for a\\nlittle time she soon began again and though much that passed\\nbetween them was

procuring exactly the desirable thing\\n\\ni not aware said jane shaking her head dear mrs elton\\nwho can have thought of it as i have done\\n\\nbut you have not seen so much of the world as i have  you do not\\nknow how many candidates there always are for the first situations\\ni saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round maple grove\\na cousin of mr suckling mrs bragge had such an infinity\\nof applications every body was anxious to be in her family\\nfor she moves in the first circle  waxcandles in the schoolroom\\nyou may imagine how desirable  of all houses in the kingdom\\nmrs bragges is the one i would most wish to see you in\\n\\ncolonel and mrs campbell are to be in town again by midsummer\\nsaid jane  i must spend some time with them i am sure they will\\nwant itafterwards i may probably be glad to dispose of myself\\nbut i would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries\\nat present\\n\\ntrouble aye i know your scruples  you are afraid of giving\\nme trouble but i assure you my dear jane the campbells can\\nhardly be more interested about you than i am  i shall write\\nto mrs partridge in a day or two and shall give her a strict\\ncharge to be on the lookout for any thing eligible\\n\\nthank you but i would rather you did not mention the subject\\nto her till the time draws nearer i do not wish to be giving\\nany body trouble\\n\\nbut my dear child the time is drawing near here is april\\nand june or say even july is very near with such business\\nto accomplish before us  your inexperience really amuses me\\na situation such as you deserve and your friends would require for you\\nis no everyday occurrence is not obtained at a moments notice\\nindeed indeed we must begin inquiring directly\\n\\nexcuse me maam but this is by no means my intention i make no\\ninquiry myself and should be sorry to have any made by my friends\\nwhen i am quite determined as to the time i am not at all afraid\\nof being long unemployed  there are places in town offices\\nwhere inquiry would soon produce somethingoffices for the sale\\nnot quite of human fleshbut of human intellect\\n\\noh my dear human flesh  you quite shock me if you mean a fling\\nat the slavetrade i assure you mr suckling was always rather\\na friend to the abolition\\n\\ni did not mean i was not thinking of the slavetrade replied jane\\ngovernesstrade i assure you was all that i had in view\\nwidely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on\\nbut as to the greater misery of the victims i do not know where\\nit lies  but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices\\nand that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon\\nmeeting with something that would do\\n\\nsomething that would do repeated mrs elton  aye that may\\nsuit your humble ideas of yourselfi know what a modest creature\\nyou are but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up\\nwith any thing that may offer any inferior commonplace situation\\nin a family not moving in a certain circle or able to command\\nthe elegancies of life\\n\\nyou are very obliging but as to all that i am very indifferent\\nit would be no object to me to be with the rich my mortifications\\ni think would only be the greater i should suffer more from comparison\\na gentlemans family is all that i should condition for\\n\\ni know you i know you you would take up with any thing but i\\nshall be a little more nice and i am sure the good campbells will\\nbe quite on my side with your superior talents you have a right\\nto move in the first circle  your musical knowledge alone would\\nentitle you to name your own terms have as many rooms as you like\\nand mix in the family as much as you chosethat isi do not know\\nif you knew the harp you might do all that i am very sure\\nbut you sing as well as playyes i really believe you might\\neven without the harp stipulate for what you choseand you must\\nand shall be delightfully honourably and comfortably settled before\\nthe campbells or i have any rest\\n\\nyou may well class the delight the honour and the comfort\\nof such a situation together said jane they are pretty sure\\nto be equal however i am very serious in not wishing any thing\\nto be attempted at present for me  i am exceedingly obliged to you\\nmrs elton i am obliged to any body who feels for me but i am\\nquite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer\\nfor two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as\\ni am\\n\\nand i am quite serious too i assure you replied mrs elton gaily\\nin resolving to be always on the watch and employing my friends\\nto watch also that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us\\n\\nin this style she ran on never thoroughly stopped by any thing\\ntill mr woodhouse came into the room her vanity had then a change\\nof object and emma heard her saying in the same halfwhisper to jane\\n\\nhere comes this dear old beau of mine i protestonly think of his\\ngallantry in coming away before the other menwhat a dear creature\\nhe isi assure you i like him excessively  i admire all that quaint\\noldfashioned politeness it is much more to my taste than modern ease\\nmodern ease often disgusts me  but this good old mr woodhouse\\ni wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner  oh  i assure\\nyou i began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous\\ni fancy i am rather a favourite he took notice of my gown\\nhow do you like itselinas choicehandsome i think but i\\ndo not know whether it is not overtrimmed i have the greatest\\ndislike to the idea of being overtrimmedquite a horror of finery\\ni must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me\\na bride you know must appear like a bride but my natural taste\\nis all for simplicity a simple style of dress is so infinitely\\npreferable to finery  but i am quite in the minority i believe\\nfew people seem to value simplicity of dressshow and finery\\nare every thing  i have some notion of putting such a trimming\\nas this to my white and silver poplin  do you think it will\\nlook well\\n\\nthe whole party were but just reassembled in the drawingroom\\nwhen mr weston made his appearance among them  he had returned\\nto a late dinner and walked to hartfield as soon as it was over\\nhe had been too much expected by the best judges for surprize\\nbut there was great joy  mr woodhouse was almost as glad to see\\nhim now as he would have been sorry to see him before  john knightley\\nonly was in mute astonishmentthat a man who might have spent\\nhis evening quietly at home after a day of business in london\\nshould set off again and walk half a mile to another mans house\\nfor the sake of being in mixed company till bedtime of finishing\\nhis day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers\\nwas a circumstance to strike him deeply  a man who had been in motion\\nsince eight oclock in the morning and might now have been still\\nwho had been long talking and might have been silent who had been\\nin more than one crowd and might have been alonesuch a man\\nto quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside\\nand on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into\\nthe worldcould he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken\\nback his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would\\nprobably prolong rather than break up the party  john knightley\\nlooked at him with amazement then shrugged his shoulders and said\\ni could not have believed it even of him\\n\\nmr weston meanwhile perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation\\nhe was exciting happy and cheerful as usual and with all\\nthe right of being principal talker which a day spent anywhere\\nfrom home confers was making himself agreeable among the rest\\nand having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner\\nconvincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants\\nhad been forgotten and spread abroad what public news he had heard\\nwas proceeding to a family communication which though principally\\naddressed to mrs weston he had not the smallest doubt of being\\nhighly interesting to every body in the room  he gave her a letter\\nit was from frank and to herself he had met with it in his way\\nand had taken the liberty of opening it\\n\\nread it read it said he it will give you pleasure\\nonly a few lineswill not take you long read it to emma\\n\\nthe two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling\\nand talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued\\nbut very audible to every body\\n\\nwell he is coming you see good news i think  well what do\\nyou say to iti always told you he would be here again soon\\ndid not ianne my dear did not i always tell you so and you would\\nnot believe mein town next week you seeat the latest i dare say\\nfor she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is\\nto be done most likely they will be there tomorrow or saturday\\nas to her illness all nothing of course  but it is an excellent\\nthing to have frank among us again so near as town  they will stay\\na good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us\\nthis is precisely what i wanted  well pretty good news is not it\\nhave you finished it  has emma read it all  put it up put it up\\nwe will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not\\ndo now  i shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a\\ncommon way\\n\\nmrs weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion\\nher looks and words had nothing to restrain them  she was happy\\nshe knew she was happy and knew she ought to be happy\\nher congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak\\nso fluently  she was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings\\nand trying to understand the degree of her agitation which she\\nrather thought was considerable\\n\\nmr weston however too eager to be very observant too communicative\\nto want others to talk was very well satisfied with what she did say\\nand soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\\ncommunication of what the whole room must have overheard already\\n\\nit was well that he took every bodys joy for granted or he\\nmight not have thought either mr woodhouse or mr knightley\\nparticularly delighted  they were the first entitled\\nafter mrs weston and emma to be made happyfrom them he would\\nhave proceeded to miss fairfax but she was so deep in conversation\\nwith john knightley that it would have been too positive\\nan interruption and finding himself close to mrs elton and\\nher attention disengaged he necessarily began on the subject with her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xviii\\n\\n\\ni hope i shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you\\nsaid mr weston\\n\\nmrs elton very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended\\nher by such a hope smiled most graciously\\n\\nyou have heard of a certain frank churchill i presume he continued\\nand know him to be my son though he does not bear my name\\n\\noh yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance\\ni am sure mr elton will lose no time in calling on him and we\\nshall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the vicarage\\n\\nyou are very obligingfrank will be extremely happy i am sure\\nhe is to be in town next week if not sooner  we have notice of it\\nin a letter today i met the letters in my way this morning\\nand seeing my sons hand presumed to open itthough it was not directed\\nto meit was to mrs weston  she is his principal correspondent\\ni assure you  i hardly ever get a letter\\n\\nand so you absolutely opened what was directed to her  oh  mr weston\\nlaughing affectedly i must protest against thata most dangerous\\nprecedent indeedi beg you will not let your neighbours follow\\nyour exampleupon my word if this is what i am to expect\\nwe married women must begin to exert ourselvesoh  mr weston\\ni could not have believed it of you\\n\\naye we men are sad fellows  you must take care of yourself\\nmrs eltonthis letter tells usit is a short letterwritten in\\na hurry merely to give us noticeit tells us that they are all\\ncoming up to town directly on mrs churchills accountshe has\\nnot been well the whole winter and thinks enscombe too cold for her\\nso they are all to move southward without loss of time\\n\\nindeedfrom yorkshire i think  enscombe is in yorkshire\\n\\nyes they are about one hundred and ninety miles from london\\na considerable journey\\n\\nyes upon my word very considerable  sixtyfive miles farther\\nthan from maple grove to london  but what is distance mr weston\\nto people of large fortuneyou would be amazed to hear how my brother\\nmr suckling sometimes flies about  you will hardly believe me\\nbut twice in one week he and mr bragge went to london and back again\\nwith four horses\\n\\nthe evil of the distance from enscombe said mr weston is that\\nmrs churchill as we understand has not been able to leave the\\nsofa for a week together  in franks last letter she complained\\nhe said of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\\nboth his arm and his uncles this you know speaks a great degree\\nof weaknessbut now she is so impatient to be in town that she\\nmeans to sleep only two nights on the roadso frank writes word\\ncertainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions\\nmrs elton  you must grant me that\\n\\nno indeed i shall grant you nothing  i always take the part\\nof my own sex  i do indeed  i give you noticeyou will find me\\na formidable antagonist on that point  i always stand up for women\\nand i assure you if you knew how selina feels with respect\\nto sleeping at an inn you would not wonder at mrs churchills\\nmaking incredible exertions to avoid it  selina says it is quite\\nhorror to herand i believe i have caught a little of her nicety\\nshe always travels with her own sheets an excellent precaution\\ndoes mrs churchill do the same\\n\\ndepend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other\\nfine lady ever did  mrs churchill will not be second to any lady\\nin the land for\\n\\nmrs elton eagerly interposed with\\n\\noh  mr weston do not mistake me  selina is no fine lady\\ni assure you  do not run away with such an idea\\n\\nis not she  then she is no rule for mrs churchill who is\\nas thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld\\n\\nmrs elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly\\nit was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister\\nwas not a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence\\nof itand she was considering in what way she had best retract\\nwhen mr weston went on\\n\\nmrs churchill is not much in my good graces as you may suspect\\nbut this is quite between ourselves  she is very fond of frank\\nand therefore i would not speak ill of her  besides she is out of\\nhealth now but that indeed by her own account she has always been\\ni would not say so to every body mrs elton but i have not much\\nfaith in mrs churchills illness\\n\\nif she is really ill why not go to bath mr westonto bath\\nor to clifton  she has taken it into her head that enscombe is too\\ncold for her  the fact is i suppose that she is tired of enscombe\\nshe has now been a longer time stationary there than she ever\\nwas before and she begins to want change  it is a retired place\\na fine place but very retired\\n\\nayelike maple grove i dare say  nothing can stand more retired from\\nthe road than maple grove  such an immense plantation all round it\\nyou seem shut out from every thingin the most complete retirement\\nand mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina\\nto enjoy that sort of seclusion  or perhaps she may not have\\nresources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life\\ni always say a woman cannot have too many resourcesand i feel\\nvery thankful that i have so many myself as to be quite independent\\nof society\\n\\nfrank was here in february for a fortnight\\n\\nso i remember to have heard  he will find an addition to the\\nsociety of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume\\nto call myself an addition  but perhaps he may never have heard\\nof there being such a creature in the world\\n\\nthis was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by\\nand mr weston with a very good grace immediately exclaimed\\n\\nmy dear madam  nobody but yourself could imagine such a\\nthing possible  not heard of youi believe mrs westons\\nletters lately have been full of very little else than mrs elton\\n\\nhe had done his duty and could return to his son\\n\\nwhen frank left us continued he it was quite uncertain when we\\nmight see him again which makes this days news doubly welcome\\nit has been completely unexpected  that is i always had a strong\\npersuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something\\nfavourable would turn upbut nobody believed me  he and mrs weston\\nwere both dreadfully desponding  how could he contrive to come\\nand how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare\\nhim again and so forthi always felt that something would happen\\nin our favour and so it has you see  i have observed mrs elton\\nin the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month\\nthey are sure to mend the next\\n\\nvery true mr weston perfectly true  it is just what i used\\nto say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship\\nwhen because things did not go quite right did not proceed with all\\nthe rapidity which suited his feelings he was apt to be in despair\\nand exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be may before\\nhymens saffron robe would be put on for us  oh the pains i have\\nbeen at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views\\nthe carriagewe had disappointments about the carriageone morning\\ni remember he came to me quite in despair\\n\\nshe was stopped by a slight fit of coughing and mr weston instantly\\nseized the opportunity of going on\\n\\nyou were mentioning may  may is the very month which mrs churchill\\nis ordered or has ordered herself to spend in some warmer place\\nthan enscombein short to spend in london so that we have the\\nagreeable prospect of frequent visits from frank the whole spring\\nprecisely the season of the year which one should have chosen\\nfor it  days almost at the longest weather genial and pleasant\\nalways inviting one out and never too hot for exercise  when he\\nwas here before we made the best of it but there was a good deal\\nof wet damp cheerless weather there always is in february you know\\nand we could not do half that we intended  now will be the time\\nthis will be complete enjoyment and i do not know mrs elton\\nwhether the uncertainty of our meetings the sort of constant\\nexpectation there will be of his coming in today or tomorrow\\nand at any hour may not be more friendly to happiness than having\\nhim actually in the house  i think it is so  i think it is the\\nstate of mind which gives most spirit and delight  i hope you\\nwill be pleased with my son but you must not expect a prodigy\\nhe is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy\\nmrs westons partiality for him is very great and as you may suppose\\nmost gratifying to me  she thinks nobody equal to him\\n\\nand i assure you mr weston i have very little doubt that my\\nopinion will be decidedly in his favour  i have heard so much\\nin praise of mr frank churchillat the same time it is fair\\nto observe that i am one of those who always judge for themselves\\nand are by no means implicitly guided by others  i give you notice\\nthat as i find your son so i shall judge of himi am no flatterer\\n\\nmr weston was musing\\n\\ni hope said he presently i have not been severe upon poor\\nmrs churchill  if she is ill i should be sorry to do her injustice\\nbut there are some traits in her character which make it difficult\\nfor me to speak of her with the forbearance i could wish\\nyou cannot be ignorant mrs elton of my connexion with the family\\nnor of the treatment i have met with and between ourselves\\nthe whole blame of it is to be laid to her  she was the instigator\\nfranks mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her\\nmr churchill has pride but his pride is nothing to his wifes\\nhis is a quiet indolent gentlemanlike sort of pride that would\\nharm nobody and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome\\nbut her pride is arrogance and insolence  and what inclines one less\\nto bear she has no fair pretence of family or blood  she was nobody\\nwhen he married her barely the daughter of a gentleman but ever\\nsince her being turned into a churchill she has outchurchilld them\\nall in high and mighty claims  but in herself i assure you she is\\nan upstart\\n\\nonly think well that must be infinitely provoking  i have quite\\na horror of upstarts  maple grove has given me a thorough disgust\\nto people of that sort for there is a family in that neighbourhood\\nwho are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs\\nthey give themselves  your description of mrs churchill made me\\nthink of them directly  people of the name of tupman very lately\\nsettled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving\\nthemselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old\\nestablished families  a year and a half is the very utmost that they can\\nhave lived at west hall and how they got their fortune nobody knows\\nthey came from birmingham which is not a place to promise much\\nyou know mr weston  one has not great hopes from birmingham\\ni always say there is something direful in the sound  but nothing\\nmore is positively known of the tupmans though a good many things\\ni assure you are suspected and yet by their manners they evidently\\nthink themselves equal even to my brother mr suckling who happens\\nto be one of their nearest neighbours  it is infinitely too bad\\nmr suckling who has been eleven years a resident at maple grove\\nand whose father had it before himi believe at leasti am\\nalmost sure that old mr suckling had completed the purchase before\\nhis death\\n\\nthey were interrupted  tea was carrying round and mr weston\\nhaving said all that he wanted soon took the opportunity of\\nwalking away\\n\\nafter tea mr and mrs weston and mr elton sat down with mr woodhouse\\nto cards  the remaining five were left to their own powers\\nand emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed\\nlittle disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice\\nwhich nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself\\nin a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent\\n\\nmr john knightley proved more talkative than his brother\\nhe was to leave them early the next day and he soon began with\\n\\nwell emma i do not believe i have any thing more to say about\\nthe boys but you have your sisters letter and every thing is\\ndown at full length there we may be sure  my charge would be much\\nmore concise than hers and probably not much in the same spirit\\nall that i have to recommend being comprised in do not spoil them\\nand do not physic them\\n\\ni rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all\\nin my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella\\nand happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic\\n\\nand if you find them troublesome you must send them home again\\n\\nthat is very likely  you think so do not you\\n\\ni hope i am aware that they may be too noisy for your father\\nor even may be some encumbrance to you if your visiting engagements\\ncontinue to increase as much as they have done lately\\n\\nincrease\\n\\ncertainly you must be sensible that the last halfyear has made\\na great difference in your way of life\\n\\ndifference  no indeed i am not\\n\\nthere can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company\\nthan you used to be  witness this very time  here am i come\\ndown for only one day and you are engaged with a dinnerparty\\nwhen did it happen before or any thing like it  your neighbourhood\\nis increasing and you mix more with it  a little while ago\\nevery letter to isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties\\ndinners at mr coles or balls at the crown  the difference\\nwhich randalls randalls alone makes in your goingson is very great\\n\\nyes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all\\n\\nvery welland as randalls i suppose is not likely to have less\\ninfluence than heretofore it strikes me as a possible thing emma\\nthat henry and john may be sometimes in the way  and if they are\\ni only beg you to send them home\\n\\nno cried mr knightley that need not be the consequence\\nlet them be sent to donwell  i shall certainly be at leisure\\n\\nupon my word exclaimed emma you amuse me  i should like to know\\nhow many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being\\nof the party and why i am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure\\nto attend to the little boys  these amazing engagements of mine\\nwhat have they been  dining once with the colesand having a ball\\ntalked of which never took place  i can understand younodding at\\nmr john knightleyyour good fortune in meeting with so many of\\nyour friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed\\nbut you turning to mr knightley who know how very very seldom\\ni am ever two hours from hartfield why you should foresee such a\\nseries of dissipation for me i cannot imagine  and as to my dear\\nlittle boys i must say that if aunt emma has not time for them\\ni do not think they would fare much better with uncle knightley\\nwho is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one\\nand who when he is at home is either reading to himself or settling\\nhis accounts\\n\\nmr knightley seemed to be trying not to smile and succeeded\\nwithout difficulty upon mrs eltons beginning to talk to him\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvolume iii\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter i\\n\\n\\na very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy emma as to the\\nnature of her agitation on hearing this news of frank churchill\\nshe was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at\\nall apprehensive or embarrassed it was for him  her own attachment\\nhad really subsided into a mere nothing it was not worth thinking of\\nbut if he who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love\\nof the two were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment\\nwhich he had taken away it would be very distressing  if a separation\\nof two months should not have cooled him there were dangers and evils\\nbefore hercaution for him and for herself would be necessary\\nshe did not mean to have her own affections entangled again\\nand it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his\\n\\nshe wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration\\nthat would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance\\nand yet she could not help rather anticipating something decisive\\nshe felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis\\nan event a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state\\n\\nit was not very long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen\\nbefore she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchills\\nfeelings  the enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had\\nbeen imagined but he was at highbury very soon afterwards  he rode\\ndown for a couple of hours he could not yet do more but as he came\\nfrom randalls immediately to hartfield she could then exercise all\\nher quick observation and speedily determine how he was influenced\\nand how she must act  they met with the utmost friendliness\\nthere could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her\\nbut she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he\\nhad done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree\\nshe watched him well  it was a clear thing he was less in love than he\\nhad been  absence with the conviction probably of her indifference\\nhad produced this very natural and very desirable effect\\n\\nhe was in high spirits as ready to talk and laugh as ever and seemed\\ndelighted to speak of his former visit and recur to old stories\\nand he was not without agitation  it was not in his calmness that\\nshe read his comparative difference  he was not calm his spirits\\nwere evidently fluttered there was restlessness about him\\nlively as he was it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself\\nbut what decided her belief on the subject was his staying only a\\nquarter of an hour and hurrying away to make other calls in highbury\\nhe had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed\\nhe had not stopped he would not stop for more than a wordbut he\\nhad the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call\\nand much as he wished to stay longer at hartfield he must hurry off\\nshe had no doubt as to his being less in lovebut neither his\\nagitated spirits nor his hurrying away seemed like a perfect cure\\nand she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her\\nreturning power and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself\\nwith her long\\n\\nthis was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days\\nhe was often hoping intending to comebut was always prevented\\nhis aunt could not bear to have him leave her  such was his own account\\nat randalls if he were quite sincere if he really tried to come\\nit was to be inferred that mrs churchills removal to london had\\nbeen of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder\\nthat she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself\\nconvinced of it at randalls  though much might be fancy he could\\nnot doubt when he looked back that she was in a weaker state\\nof health than she had been half a year ago  he did not believe it\\nto proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove\\nor at least that she might not have many years of existence before her\\nbut he could not be prevailed on by all his fathers doubts to say\\nthat her complaints were merely imaginary or that she was as strong\\nas ever\\n\\nit soon appeared that london was not the place for her  she could\\nnot endure its noise  her nerves were under continual irritation\\nand suffering and by the ten days end her nephews letter to\\nrandalls communicated a change of plan  they were going to remove\\nimmediately to richmond  mrs churchill had been recommended\\nto the medical skill of an eminent person there and had otherwise\\na fancy for the place  a readyfurnished house in a favourite\\nspot was engaged and much benefit expected from the change\\n\\nemma heard that frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement\\nand seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two\\nmonths before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends\\nfor the house was taken for may and june  she was told that now\\nhe wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them\\nalmost as often as he could even wish\\n\\nemma saw how mr weston understood these joyous prospects  he was\\nconsidering her as the source of all the happiness they offered\\nshe hoped it was not so  two months must bring it to the proof\\n\\nmr westons own happiness was indisputable  he was quite delighted\\nit was the very circumstance he could have wished for  now it would\\nbe really having frank in their neighbourhood  what were nine miles\\nto a young manan hours ride  he would be always coming over\\nthe difference in that respect of richmond and london was enough\\nto make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing\\nhim never  sixteen milesnay eighteenit must be full eighteen\\nto manchesterstreetwas a serious obstacle  were he ever able\\nto get away the day would be spent in coming and returning\\nthere was no comfort in having him in london he might as well be\\nat enscombe but richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse\\nbetter than nearer\\n\\none good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal\\nthe ball at the crown  it had not been forgotten before but it had\\nbeen soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day  now however\\nit was absolutely to be every preparation was resumed and very soon\\nafter the churchills had removed to richmond a few lines from frank\\nto say that his aunt felt already much better for the change\\nand that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twentyfour\\nhours at any given time induced them to name as early a

day arrived and after a morning of some anxious watching\\nfrank churchill in all the certainty of his own self reached randalls\\nbefore dinner and every thing was safe\\n\\nno second meeting had there yet been between him and emma\\nthe room at the crown was to witness itbut it would be better\\nthan a common meeting in a crowd  mr weston had been so very\\nearnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible\\nafter themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the\\npropriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came\\nthat she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet\\ninterval in the young mans company  she was to convey harriet\\nand they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just\\nsufficiently before them\\n\\nfrank churchill seemed to have been on the watch and though\\nhe did not say much his eyes declared that he meant to have\\na delightful evening  they all walked about together to see\\nthat every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes\\nwere joined by the contents of another carriage which emma\\ncould not hear the sound of at first without great surprize\\nso unreasonably early she was going to exclaim but she presently\\nfound that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself\\nby particular desire to help mr westons judgment and they were\\nso very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been\\nentreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness\\non the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might\\nsoon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection\\n\\nemma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which\\nmr weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and\\nintimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes\\nwas not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity\\nshe liked his open manners but a little less of openheartedness\\nwould have made him a higher charactergeneral benevolence\\nbut not general friendship made a man what he ought to be\\nshe could fancy such a man  the whole party walked about\\nand looked and praised again and then having nothing else to do\\nformed a sort of halfcircle round the fire to observe in their\\nvarious modes till other subjects were started that though may\\na fire in the evening was still very pleasant\\n\\nemma found that it was not mr westons fault that the number\\nof privy councillors was not yet larger  they had stopped\\nat mrs batess door to offer the use of their carriage\\nbut the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons\\n\\nfrank was standing by her but not steadily there was a restlessness\\nwhich shewed a mind not at ease  he was looking about he was going\\nto the door he was watching for the sound of other carriages\\nimpatient to begin or afraid of being always near her\\n\\nmrs elton was spoken of  i think she must be here soon said he\\ni have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much\\nof her  it cannot be long i think before she comes\\n\\na carriage was heard  he was on the move immediately\\nbut coming back said\\n\\ni am forgetting that i am not acquainted with her  i have never seen\\neither mr or mrs elton  i have no business to put myself forward\\n\\nmr and mrs elton appeared and all the smiles and the proprieties passed\\n\\nbut miss bates and miss fairfax said mr weston looking about\\nwe thought you were to bring them\\n\\nthe mistake had been slight  the carriage was sent for them now\\nemma longed to know what franks first opinion of mrs elton\\nmight be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress\\nand her smiles of graciousness  he was immediately qualifying\\nhimself to form an opinion by giving her very proper attention\\nafter the introduction had passed\\n\\nin a few minutes the carriage returnedsomebody talked of rain\\ni will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father\\nmiss bates must not be forgotten  and away he went  mr weston\\nwas following but mrs elton detained him to gratify him by her\\nopinion of his son and so briskly did she begin that the young\\nman himself though by no means moving slowly could hardly be out\\nof hearing\\n\\na very fine young man indeed mr weston  you know i candidly told\\nyou i should form my own opinion and i am happy to say that i am\\nextremely pleased with himyou may believe me  i never compliment\\ni think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely\\nwhat i like and approveso truly the gentleman without the least\\nconceit or puppyism  you must know i have a vast dislike to puppies\\nquite a horror of them  they were never tolerated at maple grove\\nneither mr suckling nor me had ever any patience with them and we\\nused sometimes to say very cutting things  selina who is mild almost\\nto a fault bore with them much better\\n\\nwhile she talked of his son mr westons attention was chained\\nbut when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were\\nladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must\\nhurry away\\n\\nmrs elton turned to mrs weston  i have no doubt of its being\\nour carriage with miss bates and jane  our coachman and horses are\\nso extremely expeditiousi believe we drive faster than any body\\nwhat a pleasure it is to send ones

fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen\\nwalked into the room and mrs elton seemed to think it as much\\nher duty as mrs westons to receive them  her gestures and\\nmovements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma\\nbut her words every bodys words were soon lost under the\\nincessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not\\nfinished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted\\ninto the circle at the fire  as the door opened she was heard\\n\\nso very obliging of youno rain at all  nothing to signify\\ni do not care for myself  quite thick shoes  and jane

herself necessarily overhearing the\\ndiscourse of mrs elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little\\nway behind herhe was thoughtful  whether he were overhearing too\\nshe could not determine  after a good many compliments to jane\\non her dress and look compliments very quietly and properly taken\\nmrs elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself\\nand it was how do you like my gownhow do you like my trimming\\nhow has wright done my hairwith many other relative questions\\nall answered with patient politeness  mrs elton then said\\nnobody can think less of dress in general than i dobut upon such\\nan occasion as this when every bodys eyes are so much upon me\\nand in compliment to the westonswho i have no doubt are giving\\nthis ball chiefly to do me honouri would not wish to be inferior\\nto others  and i see very few pearls in the room except mine\\nso frank churchill is a capital dancer i understandwe shall see\\nif our styles suita fine young man certainly is frank churchill\\ni like him very well\\n\\nat this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could\\nnot but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want\\nto hear moreand the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while\\ntill another suspension brought mrs eltons tones again distinctly\\nforwardmr elton had just joined them and his wife was exclaiming\\n\\noh you have found us out at last have you in our seclusion\\ni was this moment telling jane i thought you would begin to be\\nimpatient for tidings of us\\n\\njanerepeated frank churchill with a look of surprize and displeasure\\nthat is easybut miss fairfax does not disapprove it i suppose\\n\\nhow do you like mrs elton said emma in a whisper\\n\\nnot at all\\n\\nyou are ungrateful\\n\\nungratefulwhat do you mean  then changing from a frown to\\na smileno do not tell mei do not want to know what you mean\\nwhere is my fatherwhen are we to begin dancing\\n\\nemma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour\\nhe walked off to find his father but was quickly back again with both\\nmr and mrs weston  he had met with them in a little perplexity\\nwhich must be laid before emma  it had just occurred to mrs weston\\nthat mrs elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would\\nexpect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma\\nthat distinctionemma heard the sad truth with fortitude\\n\\nand what are we to do for a proper partner for her said mr weston\\nshe will think frank ought to ask her\\n\\nfrank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise\\nand boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most\\nperfect approbation ofand it then appeared that mrs weston was\\nwanting him to dance with mrs elton himself and that their business\\nwas to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon\\nmr weston and mrs elton led the way mr frank churchill and miss\\nwoodhouse followed  emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton\\nthough she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her\\nit was almost enough to make her think of marrying  mrs elton had\\nundoubtedly the advantage at this time in vanity completely gratified\\nfor though she had intended to begin with frank churchill she could\\nnot lose by the change  mr weston might be his sons superior\\nin spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment\\ndelighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming\\nand to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her\\nshe was more disturbed by mr knightleys not dancing than by any\\nthing elsethere he was among the standersby where he ought not\\nto be he ought to be dancingnot classing himself with the husbands\\nand fathers and whistplayers who were pretending to feel an interest\\nin the dance till their rubbers were made upso young as he looked\\nhe could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere\\nthan where he had placed himself  his tall firm upright figure\\namong the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men\\nwas such as emma felt must draw every bodys eyes and excepting her\\nown partner there was not one among the whole row of young men\\nwho could be compared with himhe moved a few steps nearer\\nand those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike\\na manner with what natural grace he must have danced would he\\nbut take the troublewhenever she caught his eye she forced him\\nto smile but in general he was looking grave  she wished he could\\nlove a ballroom better and could like frank churchill better\\nhe seemed often observing her  she must not flatter herself that he\\nthought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour\\nshe did not feel afraid  there was nothing like flirtation between\\nher and her partner  they seemed more like cheerful easy friends\\nthan lovers  that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done\\nwas indubitable\\n\\nthe ball proceeded pleasantly  the anxious cares the incessant\\nattentions of mrs weston were not thrown away  every body\\nseemed happy and the praise of being a delightful ball\\nwhich is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be\\nwas repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this\\nof very important very recordable events it was not more productive\\nthan such meetings usually are  there was one however which emma\\nthought something ofthe two last dances before supper were begun\\nand harriet had no partnerthe only young lady sitting down\\nand so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers that how there\\ncould be any one disengaged was the wonderbut emmas wonder\\nlessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about\\nhe would not ask harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided\\nshe was sure he would notand she was expecting him every moment to\\nescape into the cardroom\\n\\nescape however was not his plan  he came to the part of the room\\nwhere the sittersby were collected spoke to some and walked about\\nin front of them as if to shew his liberty and his resolution\\nof maintaining it  he did not omit being sometimes directly\\nbefore miss smith or speaking to those who were close to her\\nemma saw it  she was not yet dancing she was working her way\\nup from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around\\nand by only turning her head a little she saw it all  when she was\\nhalfway up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she\\nwould no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near\\nthat she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took\\nplace between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife\\nwho was standing immediately above her was not only listening also\\nbut even encouraging him by significant glancesthe kindhearted\\ngentle mrs weston had left her seat to join him and say do not\\nyou dance mr elton to which his prompt reply was most readily\\nmrs weston if you will dance with me\\n\\nmeoh noi would get you a better partner than myself\\ni am no dancer\\n\\nif mrs gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure\\ni am surefor though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man\\nand that my dancing days are over it would give me very great\\npleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs gilbert\\n\\nmrs gilbert does not mean to dance but there is a young lady\\ndisengaged whom i should be very glad to see dancingmiss smith\\nmiss smithohi had not observedyou are extremely obliging\\nand if i were not an old married manbut my dancing days are over\\nmrs weston  you will excuse me  any thing else i should be most happy\\nto do at your commandbut my dancing days are over\\n\\nmrs weston said no more and emma could imagine with what\\nsurprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat\\nthis was mr elton the amiable obliging gentle mr elton\\nshe looked round for a moment he had joined mr knightley at a\\nlittle distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation\\nwhile smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife\\n\\nshe would not look again  her heart was in a glow and she feared\\nher face might be as hot\\n\\nin another moment a happier sight caught hermr knightley\\nleading harriet to the setnever had she been more surprized\\nseldom more delighted than at that instant  she was all pleasure\\nand gratitude both for harriet and herself and longed to be\\nthanking him and though too distant for speech her countenance\\nsaid much as soon as she could catch his eye again\\n\\nhis dancing proved to be just what she had believed it\\nextremely good and harriet would have seemed almost too lucky\\nif it had not been for the cruel state of things before and for\\nthe very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction\\nwhich her happy features announced  it was not thrown away on her\\nshe bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle\\nand was in a continual course of smiles\\n\\nmr elton had retreated into the cardroom looking emma trusted\\nvery foolish  she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife\\nthough growing very like hershe spoke some of her feelings\\nby observing audibly to her partner\\n\\nknightley has taken pity on poor little miss smithvery goodnatured\\ni declare\\n\\nsupper was announced  the move began and miss bates might be\\nheard from that moment without interruption till her being\\nseated at table and taking up her

with mr woodhouse a vast deal of chat\\nand backgammontea was made downstairs biscuits and baked apples\\nand wine before she came away  amazing luck in some of her throws\\nand she inquired a great

convinced there were two and there is but one  i never saw any\\nthing equal to the comfort and stylecandles everywherei was telling\\nyou of your grandmama janethere was a little disappointment\\nthe baked apples and biscuits excellent in their way you know\\nbut there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus\\nbrought in at first and good mr woodhouse not thinking the\\nasparagus quite boiled enough sent it all out again  now there\\nis nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus\\nso she was rather disappointed but we agreed we would not speak of it\\nto any

soup too  bless me\\ni should not be helped so soon but it smells most excellent and i\\ncannot help beginning\\n\\nemma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till\\nafter supper but when they were all in the ballroom again\\nher eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked\\nhe was warm in his reprobation of mr eltons conduct it had been\\nunpardonable rudeness and mrs eltons looks also received the due\\nshare of censure\\n\\nthey aimed at wounding more than harriet said he  emma why\\nis it that they are your enemies\\n\\nhe looked with smiling penetration and on receiving\\nno answer added she ought not to be angry with you i suspect\\nwhatever he may beto that surmise you say nothing of course\\nbut confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet\\n\\ni did replied emma and they cannot forgive me\\n\\nhe shook his head but there was a smile of indulgence with it\\nand he only said\\n\\ni shall not scold you  i leave you to your own reflections\\n\\ncan you trust me with such flatterersdoes my vain spirit ever\\ntell me i am wrong\\n\\nnot your vain spirit but your serious spiritif one leads\\nyou wrong i am sure the other tells you of it\\n\\ni do own myself to have been completely mistaken in mr elton\\nthere is a littleness about him which you discovered and which i\\ndid not  and i was fully convinced of his being in love with harriet\\nit was through a series of strange blunders\\n\\nand in return for your acknowledging so much i will do you the justice\\nto say that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for\\nhimselfharriet smith has some firstrate qualities which mrs elton\\nis totally without  an unpretending singleminded artless girl\\ninfinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such\\na woman as mrs elton  i found harriet more conversable than i expected\\n\\nemma was extremely gratifiedthey were interrupted by the bustle\\nof mr weston calling on every body to begin dancing again\\n\\ncome miss woodhouse miss otway miss fairfax what are you all doing\\ncome emma set your companions the example  every body is lazy\\nevery body is asleep\\n\\ni am ready said emma whenever i am wanted\\n\\nwhom are you going to dance with asked mr knightley\\n\\nshe hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will\\nask me\\n\\nwill you said he offering his hand\\n\\nindeed i will  you have shewn that you can dance and you know we\\nare not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper\\n\\nbrother and sister no indeed\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iii\\n\\n\\nthis little explanation with mr knightley gave emma considerable\\npleasure  it was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball\\nwhich she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoyshe was\\nextremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting\\nthe eltons and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so\\nmuch alike and his praise of harriet his concession in her favour\\nwas peculiarly gratifying  the impertinence of the eltons which for\\na few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening had been\\nthe occasion of some of its highest satisfactions and she looked\\nforward to another happy resultthe cure of harriets infatuation\\nfrom harriets manner of speaking of the circumstance before they\\nquitted the ballroom she had strong hopes  it seemed as if her eyes\\nwere suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr elton\\nwas not the superior creature she had believed him  the fever\\nwas over and emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being\\nquickened again by injurious courtesy  she depended on the evil\\nfeelings of the eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed\\nneglect that could be farther requisiteharriet rational\\nfrank churchill not too much in love and mr knightley not\\nwanting to quarrel with her how very happy a summer must be before her\\n\\nshe was not to see frank churchill this morning  he had told\\nher that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping\\nat hartfield as he was to be at home by the middle of the day\\nshe did not regret it\\n\\nhaving arranged all these matters looked them through and put them all\\nto rights she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\\nfor the demands of the two little boys as well as of their grandpapa\\nwhen the great iron sweepgate opened and two persons entered\\nwhom she had never less expected to see togetherfrank churchill\\nwith harriet leaning on his armactually harrieta moment\\nsufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened\\nharriet looked white and frightened and he was trying to cheer her\\nthe iron gates and the frontdoor were not twenty yards asunder\\nthey were all three soon in the hall and harriet immediately sinking\\ninto a chair fainted away\\n\\na young lady who faints must be recovered questions must be answered\\nand surprizes be explained  such events are very interesting\\nbut the suspense of them cannot last long  a few minutes made emma\\nacquainted with the whole\\n\\nmiss smith and miss bickerton another parlour boarder at\\nmrs goddards who had been also at the ball had walked out together\\nand taken a road the richmond road which though apparently public\\nenough for safety had led them into alarmabout half a mile\\nbeyond highbury making a sudden turn and deeply shaded by elms\\non each side it became for a considerable stretch very retired\\nand when the young ladies had advanced some way into it\\nthey had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them\\non a broader patch of greensward by the side a party of gipsies\\na child on the watch came towards them to beg and miss bickerton\\nexcessively frightened gave a great scream and calling on harriet\\nto follow her ran up a steep bank cleared a slight hedge at the top\\nand made the best of her way by a short cut back to highbury\\nbut poor harriet could not follow  she had suffered very much\\nfrom cramp after dancing and her first attempt to mount the bank\\nbrought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless\\nand in this state and exceedingly terrified she had been obliged\\nto remain\\n\\nhow the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been\\nmore courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack\\ncould not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a\\ndozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous\\nand impertinent in look though not absolutely in wordmore and\\nmore frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out\\nher purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more\\nor to use her illshe was then able to walk though but slowly\\nand was moving awaybut her terror and her purse were too tempting\\nand she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang\\ndemanding more\\n\\nin this state frank churchill had found her she trembling\\nand conditioning they loud and insolent  by a most fortunate\\nchance his leaving highbury had been delayed so as to bring him\\nto her assistance at this critical moment  the pleasantness\\nof the morning had induced him to walk forward and leave his\\nhorses to meet him by another road a mile or two beyond highbury\\nand happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before\\nof miss bates and to have forgotten to restore them he had\\nbeen obliged to stop at her door and go in for a few minutes\\nhe was therefore later than he had intended and being on foot\\nwas unseen by the whole party till almost close to them\\nthe terror which the woman and boy had been creating in harriet\\nwas then their own portion  he had left them completely frightened\\nand harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak\\nhad just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits\\nwere quite overcome  it was his idea to bring her to hartfield\\nhe had thought of no other place\\n\\nthis was the amount of the whole storyof his communication and\\nof harriets as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech\\nhe dared not stay longer than to see her well these several delays\\nleft him not another minute to lose and emma engaging to give\\nassurance of her safety to mrs goddard and notice of there\\nbeing such a set of people in the neighbourhood to mr knightley\\nhe set off with all the grateful blessings that she could utter\\nfor her friend and herself\\n\\nsuch an adventure as thisa fine young man and a lovely young\\nwoman thrown together in such a way could hardly fail of suggesting\\ncertain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain\\nso emma thought at least  could a linguist could a grammarian\\ncould even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their\\nappearance together and heard their history of it without feeling\\nthat circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting\\nto each otherhow much more must an imaginist like herself\\nbe on fire with speculation and foresightespecially with such\\na groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made\\n\\nit was a very extraordinary thing  nothing of the sort had ever\\noccurred before to any young ladies in the place within her memory\\nno rencontre no alarm of the kindand now it had happened\\nto the very person and at the very hour when the other very\\nperson was chancing to pass by to rescue herit certainly\\nwas very extraordinaryand knowing as she did the favourable\\nstate of mind of each at this period it struck her the more\\nhe was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself\\nshe just recovering from her mania for mr elton  it seemed as if\\nevery thing united to promise the most interesting consequences\\nit was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly\\nrecommending each to the other\\n\\nin the few minutes conversation which she had yet had with him\\nwhile harriet had been partially insensible he had spoken of her terror\\nher naivete her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm with a\\nsensibility amused and delighted and just at last after harriets\\nown account had been given he had expressed his indignation\\nat the abominable folly of miss bickerton in the warmest terms\\nevery thing was to take its natural course however neither impelled\\nnor assisted  she would not stir a step nor drop a hint\\nno she had had enough of interference  there could be no harm\\nin a scheme a mere passive scheme  it was no more than a wish\\nbeyond it she would on no account proceed\\n\\nemmas first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge\\nof what had passedaware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion\\nbut she soon felt that concealment must be impossible  within half\\nan hour it was known all over highbury  it was the very event\\nto engage those who talk most the young and the low and all\\nthe youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of\\nfrightful news  the last nights ball seemed lost in the gipsies\\npoor mr woodhouse trembled as he sat and as emma had foreseen\\nwould scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go\\nbeyond the shrubbery again  it was some comfort to him that many\\ninquiries after himself and miss woodhouse for his neighbours\\nknew that he loved to be inquired after as well as miss smith\\nwere coming in during the rest of the day and he had the pleasure\\nof returning for answer that they were all very indifferent\\nwhich though not exactly true for she was perfectly well\\nand harriet not much otherwise emma would not interfere with\\nshe had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such\\na man for she hardly knew what indisposition was and if he did not\\ninvent illnesses for her she could make no figure in a message\\n\\nthe gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took\\nthemselves off in a hurry  the young ladies of highbury might have\\nwalked again in safety before their panic began and the whole\\nhistory dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to emma\\nand her nephewsin her imagination it maintained its ground\\nand henry and john were still asking every day for the story of\\nharriet and the gipsies and still tenaciously setting her right\\nif she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter iv\\n\\n\\na very few days had passed after this adventure when harriet came\\none morning to emma with a small parcel in her hand and after\\nsitting down and hesitating thus began\\n\\nmiss woodhouseif you are at leisurei have something that i\\nshould like to tell youa sort of confession to makeand then\\nyou know it will be over\\n\\nemma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak\\nthere was a seriousness in harriets manner which prepared her\\nquite as much as her words for something more than ordinary\\n\\nit is my duty and i am sure it is my wish she continued\\nto have no reserves with you on this subject  as i am happily\\nquite an altered creature in one respect it is very fit that you\\nshould have the satisfaction of knowing it  i do not want to say\\nmore than is necessaryi am too much ashamed of having given way\\nas i have done and i dare say you understand me\\n\\nyes said emma i hope i do\\n\\nhow i could so long a time be fancying myself   \\ncried harriet warmly  it seems like madness  i can see nothing\\nat all extraordinary in him nowi do not care whether i meet\\nhim or notexcept that of the two i had rather not see him\\nand indeed i would go any distance round to avoid himbut i do\\nnot envy his wife in the least i neither admire her nor envy her\\nas i have done  she is very charming i dare say and all that\\nbut i think her very illtempered and disagreeablei shall never forget\\nher look the other nighthowever i assure you miss woodhouse\\ni wish her no evilno let them be ever so happy together\\nit will not give me another moments pang  and to convince you\\nthat i have been speaking truth i am now going to destroywhat i\\nought to have destroyed long agowhat i ought never to have kept\\ni know that very well blushing as she spokehowever now i\\nwill destroy it alland it is my particular wish to do it\\nin your presence that you may see how rational i am grown\\ncannot you guess what this parcel holds said she with a conscious look\\n\\nnot the least in the worlddid he ever give you any thing\\n\\nnoi cannot call them gifts but they are things that i have\\nvalued very much\\n\\nshe held the parcel towards her and emma read the words most\\nprecious treasures on the top  her curiosity was greatly excited\\nharriet unfolded the parcel and she looked on with impatience\\nwithin abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridgeware box\\nwhich harriet opened  it was well lined with the softest cotton\\nbut excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of courtplaister\\n\\nnow said harriet you must recollect\\n\\nno indeed i do not\\n\\ndear me  i should not have thought it possible you could forget\\nwhat passed in this very room about courtplaister one of the very\\nlast times we ever met in itit was but a very few days before i\\nhad my sore throatjust before mr and mrs john knightley came\\ni think the very eveningdo not you remember his cutting his finger\\nwith your new penknife and your recommending courtplaister\\nbut as you had none about you and knew i had you desired\\nme to supply him and so i took mine out and cut him a piece\\nbut it was a great deal too large and he cut it smaller and kept\\nplaying some time with what was left before he gave it back to me\\nand so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it\\nso i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then\\nas a great treat\\n\\nmy dearest harriet cried emma putting her hand before her face\\nand jumping up you make me more ashamed of myself than i can bear\\nremember it  aye i remember it all now all except your saving\\nthis relici knew nothing of that till this momentbut the cutting\\nthe finger and my recommending courtplaister and saying i had none\\nabout meoh my sins my sinsand i had plenty all the while in\\nmy pocketone of my senseless tricksi deserve to be under a\\ncontinual blush all the rest of my lifewellsitting down again\\ngo onwhat else\\n\\nand had you really some at hand yourself  i am sure i never\\nsuspected it you did it so naturally\\n\\nand so you actually put this piece of courtplaister by for his sake\\nsaid emma recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\\nbetween wonder and amusement  and secretly she added to herself\\nlord bless me when should i ever have thought of putting by in cotton\\na piece of courtplaister that frank churchill had been pulling about\\ni never was equal to this\\n\\nhere resumed harriet turning to her box again here is\\nsomething still more valuable i mean that has been more valuable\\nbecause this is what did really once belong to him which the\\ncourtplaister never did\\n\\nemma was quite eager to see this superior treasure  it was the end\\nof an old pencilthe part without any lead\\n\\nthis was really his said harrietdo not you remember\\none morningno i dare say you do not  but one morningi forget\\nexactly the daybut perhaps it was the tuesday or wednesday before\\nthat evening he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocketbook\\nit was about sprucebeer mr knightley had been telling him\\nsomething about brewing sprucebeer and he wanted to put it down\\nbut when he took out his pencil there was so little lead that he\\nsoon cut it all away and it would not do so you lent him another\\nand this was left upon the table as good for nothing  but i kept\\nmy eye on it and as soon as i dared caught it up and never\\nparted with it again from that moment\\n\\ni do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember it\\ntalking about sprucebeeroh yesmr knightley and i both saying we\\nliked it and mr eltons seeming resolved to learn to like it too\\ni perfectly remember itstop mr knightley was standing just here\\nwas not he  i have an idea he was standing just here\\n\\nah  i do not know  i cannot recollectit is very odd\\nbut i cannot recollectmr elton was sitting here i remember\\nmuch about where i am now\\n\\nwell go on\\n\\noh thats all  i have nothing more to shew you or to say\\nexcept that i am now going to throw them both behind the fire\\nand i wish you to see me do it\\n\\nmy poor dear harriet and have you actually found happiness\\nin treasuring up these things\\n\\nyes simpleton as i wasbut i am quite ashamed of it now and wish\\ni could forget as easily as i can burn them  it was very wrong\\nof me you know to keep any remembrances after he was married\\ni knew it wasbut had not resolution enough to part with them\\n\\nbut harriet is it necessary to burn the courtplaisteri have\\nnot a word to say for the bit of old pencil but the courtplaister\\nmight be useful\\n\\ni shall be happier to burn it replied harriet  it has\\na disagreeable look to me  i must get rid of every thing\\nthere it goes and there is an end thank heaven of mr elton\\n\\nand when thought emma will there be a beginning of mr churchill\\n\\nshe had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was\\nalready made and could not but hope that the gipsy though she had\\ntold no fortune might be proved to have made harrietsabout a\\nfortnight after the alarm they came to a sufficient explanation\\nand quite undesignedly  emma was not thinking of it at the moment\\nwhich made the information she received more valuable\\nshe merely said in the course of some trivial chat well harriet\\nwhenever you marry i would advise you to do so and soand thought\\nno more of it till after a minutes silence she heard harriet\\nsay in a very serious tone i shall never marry\\n\\nemma then looked up and immediately saw how it was and after a\\nmoments debate as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not replied\\n\\nnever marrythis is a new resolution\\n\\nit is one that i shall never change however\\n\\nafter another short hesitation i hope it does not proceed from\\ni hope it is not in compliment to mr elton\\n\\nmr elton indeed cried harriet indignantlyoh noand emma\\ncould just catch the words so superior to mr elton\\n\\nshe then took a longer time for consideration  should she proceed\\nno farthershould she let it pass and seem to suspect nothing\\nperhaps harriet might think her cold or angry if she did\\nor perhaps if she were totally silent it might only drive\\nharriet into asking her to hear too much and against any thing\\nlike such an unreserve as had been such an open and frequent\\ndiscussion of hopes and chances she was perfectly resolved\\nshe believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once\\nall that she meant to say and know  plain dealing was always best\\nshe had previously determined how far she would proceed\\non any application of the sort and it would be safer for both\\nto have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed\\nshe was decided and thus spoke\\n\\nharriet i will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning\\nyour resolution or rather your expectation of never marrying\\nresults from an idea that the person whom you might prefer\\nwould be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you\\nis not it so\\n\\noh  miss woodhouse believe me i have not the presumption to suppose\\nindeed i am not so madbut it is a pleasure to me to admire him\\nat a distanceand to think of his infinite superiority to all\\nthe rest of the world with the gratitude wonder and veneration\\nwhich are so proper in me especially\\n\\ni am not at all surprized at you harriet  the service he rendered\\nyou was enough to warm your heart\\n\\nservice oh it was such an inexpressible obligation\\nthe very recollection of it and all that i felt at the time\\nwhen i saw him cominghis noble lookand my wretchedness before\\nsuch a change  in one moment such a change  from perfect misery\\nto perfect happiness\\n\\nit is very natural  it is natural and it is honourable\\nyes honourable i think to chuse so well and so gratefully\\nbut that it will be a fortunate preference is more that i can promise\\ni do not advise you to give way to it harriet  i do not by any\\nmeans engage for its being returned  consider what you are about\\nperhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can\\nat any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded\\nof his liking you  be observant of him  let his behaviour be the\\nguide of your sensations  i give you this caution now because i\\nshall never speak to you again on the subject  i am determined\\nagainst all interference  henceforward i know nothing of the matter\\nlet no name ever pass our lips  we were very wrong before\\nwe will be cautious nowhe is your superior no doubt and there\\ndo seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature\\nbut yet harriet more wonderful things have taken place there have\\nbeen matches of greater disparity  but take care of yourself\\ni would not have you too sanguine though however it may end\\nbe assured your raising your thoughts to him is a mark of good taste\\nwhich i shall always know how to value\\n\\nharriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude\\nemma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing\\nfor her friend  its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind\\nand it must be saving her from the danger of degradation\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter v\\n\\n\\nin this state of schemes and hopes and connivance june opened\\nupon hartfield  to highbury in general it brought no material change\\nthe eltons were still talking of a visit from the sucklings\\nand of the use to be made of their barouchelandau and jane fairfax\\nwas still at her grandmothers and as the return of the campbells\\nfrom ireland was again delayed and august instead of midsummer\\nfixed for it she was likely to remain there full two months longer\\nprovided at least she were able to defeat mrs eltons activity\\nin her service and save herself from being hurried into a delightful\\nsituation against her will\\n\\nmr knightley who for some reason best known to himself had certainly\\ntaken an early dislike to frank churchill was only growing to dislike\\nhim more  he began to suspect him of some double dealing in his\\npursuit of emma  that emma was his object appeared indisputable\\nevery thing declared it his own attentions his fathers hints\\nhis motherinlaws guarded silence it was all in unison\\nwords conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story\\nbut while so many were devoting him to emma and emma herself making him\\nover to harriet mr knightley began to suspect him of some inclination\\nto trifle with jane fairfax  he could not understand it but there\\nwere symptoms of intelligence between themhe thought so at least\\nsymptoms of admiration on his side which having once observed\\nhe could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning\\nhowever he might wish to escape any of emmas errors of imagination\\nshe was not present when the suspicion first arose  he was dining\\nwith the randalls family and jane at the eltons and he had\\nseen a look more than a single look at miss fairfax which\\nfrom the admirer of miss woodhouse seemed somewhat out of place\\nwhen he was again in their company he could not help remembering\\nwhat he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it\\nwere like cowper and his fire at twilight\\n\\nmyself creating what i saw\\n\\nbrought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something\\nof private liking of private understanding even between frank\\nchurchill and jane\\n\\nhe had walked up one day after dinner as he very often did\\nto spend his evening at hartfield  emma and harriet were going\\nto walk he joined them and on returning they fell in with a\\nlarger party who like themselves judged it wisest to take their\\nexercise early as the weather threatened rain mr and mrs weston\\nand their son miss bates and her niece who had accidentally met\\nthey all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it\\nwas exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father\\npressed them all to go in and drink tea with him  the randalls\\nparty agreed to it immediately and after a pretty long speech\\nfrom miss bates which few persons listened to she also found it\\npossible to accept dear miss woodhouses most obliging invitation\\n\\nas they were turning into the grounds mr perry passed by on horseback\\nthe gentlemen spoke of his horse\\n\\nby the bye said frank churchill to mrs weston presently\\nwhat became of mr perrys plan of setting up his carriage\\n\\nmrs weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he\\never had any such plan\\n\\nnay i had it from you  you wrote me word of it three months ago\\n\\nme impossible\\n\\nindeed you did  i remember it perfectly  you mentioned it as\\nwhat was certainly to be very soon  mrs perry had told somebody\\nand was extremely happy about it  it was owing to her persuasion\\nas she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal\\nof harm  you must remember it now\\n\\nupon my word i never heard of it till this moment\\n\\nnever really neverbless me how could it bethen i must\\nhave dreamt itbut i was completely persuadedmiss smith\\nyou walk as if you were tired  you will not be sorry to find\\nyourself at home\\n\\nwhat is thiswhat is this cried mr weston about perry\\nand a carriage  is perry going to set up his carriage frank\\ni am glad he can afford it  you had it from himself had you\\n\\nno sir replied his son laughing i seem to have had it\\nfrom nobodyvery oddi really was persuaded of mrs westons\\nhaving mentioned it in one of her letters to enscombe many weeks ago\\nwith all these particularsbut as she declares she never heard\\na syllable of it before of course it must have been a dream  i am\\na great dreamer  i dream of every body at highbury when i am away\\nand when i have gone through my particular friends then i begin\\ndreaming of mr and mrs perry\\n\\nit is odd though observed his father that you should have had such\\na regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\\nshould be thinking of at enscombe  perrys setting up his carriage\\nand his wifes persuading him to it out of care for his health\\njust what will happen i have no doubt some time or other\\nonly a little premature  what an air of probability sometimes\\nruns through a dream  and at others what a heap of absurdities\\nit is  well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in\\nyour thoughts when you are absent  emma you are a great dreamer\\ni think\\n\\nemma was out of hearing  she had hurried on before her guests\\nto prepare her father for their appearance and was beyond the reach\\nof mr westons hint\\n\\nwhy to own the truth cried miss bates who had been trying in vain\\nto be heard the last two minutes if i must speak on this subject\\nthere is no denying that mr frank churchill might havei do not\\nmean to say that he did not dream iti am sure i have sometimes\\nthe oddest dreams in the worldbut if i am questioned about it\\ni must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring\\nfor mrs perry herself mentioned it to my mother and the coles\\nknew of it as well as ourselvesbut it was quite a secret\\nknown to nobody else and only thought of about three days\\nmrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came\\nto my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she\\nhad prevailed  jane dont you remember grandmamas telling us\\nof it when we got home  i forget where we had been walking to\\nvery likely to randalls yes i think it was to randalls\\nmrs perry was always particularly fond of my motherindeed i do\\nnot know who is notand she had mentioned it to her in confidence\\nshe had no objection to her telling us of course but it was not\\nto go beyond  and from that day to this i never mentioned it\\nto a soul that i know of  at the same time i will not positively\\nanswer for my having never dropt a hint because i know i do\\nsometimes pop out a thing before i am aware  i am a talker\\nyou know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing\\nescape me which i should not  i am not like jane i wish i were\\ni will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world\\nwhere is sheoh just behind  perfectly remember mrs perrys coming\\nextraordinary dream indeed\\n\\nthey were entering the hall  mr knightleys eyes had preceded\\nmiss batess in a glance at jane  from frank churchills face\\nwhere he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away\\nhe had involuntarily turned to hers but she was indeed behind\\nand too busy with her shawl  mr weston had walked in  the two\\nother gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass  mr knightley\\nsuspected in frank churchill the determination of catching her eye\\nhe seemed watching her intentlyin vain however if it were so\\njane passed between them into the hall and looked at neither\\n\\nthere was no time for farther remark or explanation  the dream must\\nbe borne with and mr knightley must take his seat with the rest round\\nthe large modern circular table which emma had introduced at hartfield\\nand which none but emma could have had power to place there and\\npersuade her father to use instead of the smallsized pembroke\\non which two of his daily meals had for forty years been crowded\\ntea passed pleasantly and nobody seemed in a hurry to move\\n\\nmiss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table\\nbehind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken\\naway their alphabetstheir box of letters  it used to stand here\\nwhere is it  this is a sort of dulllooking evening that ought\\nto be treated rather as winter than summer  we had great amusement\\nwith those letters one morning  i want to puzzle you again\\n\\nemma was pleased with the thought and producing the box the table\\nwas quickly scattered over with alphabets which no one seemed so much\\ndisposed to employ as their two selves  they were rapidly forming\\nwords for each other or for any body else who would be puzzled\\nthe quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for\\nmr woodhouse who had often been distressed by the more animated sort\\nwhich mr weston had occasionally introduced and who now sat happily\\noccupied in lamenting with tender melancholy over the departure\\nof the poor little boys or in fondly pointing out as he took\\nup any stray letter near him how beautifully emma had written it\\n\\nfrank churchill placed a word before miss fairfax  she gave\\na slight glance round the table and applied herself to it\\nfrank was next to emma jane opposite to themand mr knightley\\nso placed as to see them all and it was his object to see as much\\nas he could with as little apparent observation  the word\\nwas discovered and with a faint smile pushed away  if meant\\nto be immediately mixed with the others and buried from sight\\nshe should have looked on the table instead of looking just across\\nfor it was not mixed and harriet eager after every fresh word\\nand finding out none directly took it up and fell to work\\nshe was sitting by mr knightley and turned to him for help\\nthe word was blunder and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it\\nthere was a blush on janes cheek which gave it a meaning not\\notherwise ostensible  mr knightley connected it with the dream\\nbut how it could all be was beyond his comprehension\\nhow the delicacy the discretion of his favourite could have been\\nso lain asleep  he feared there must be some decided involvement\\ndisingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn\\nthese letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick\\nit was a childs play chosen to conceal a deeper game on frank\\nchurchills part\\n\\nwith great indignation did he continue to observe him with great\\nalarm and distrust to observe also his two blinded companions\\nhe saw a short word prepared for emma and given to her with a look\\nsly and demure  he saw that emma had soon made it out and found\\nit highly entertaining though it was something which she judged it\\nproper to appear to censure for she said nonsense for shame\\nhe heard frank churchill next say with a glance towards jane\\ni will give it to hershall iand as clearly heard emma\\nopposing it with eager laughing warmth  no no you must not\\nyou shall not indeed\\n\\nit was done however  this gallant young man who seemed to love\\nwithout feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance\\ndirectly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular\\ndegree of sedate civility entreated her to study it  mr knightleys\\nexcessive curiosity to know what this word might be made him seize\\nevery possible moment for darting his eye towards it and it was\\nnot long before he saw it to be dixon  jane fairfaxs perception\\nseemed to accompany his her comprehension was certainly more equal\\nto the covert meaning the superior intelligence of those five letters\\nso arranged  she was evidently displeased looked up and seeing\\nherself watched blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her\\nand saying only i did not know that proper names were allowed\\npushed away the letters with even an angry spirit and looked\\nresolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered\\nher face was averted from those who had made the attack and turned\\ntowards her aunt\\n\\naye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not\\nspoken a wordi was just going to say the same thing  it is time\\nfor us to be going indeed  the evening is closing in and grandmama\\nwill be looking for us  my dear sir you are too obliging\\nwe really must wish you good night\\n\\njanes alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt\\nhad preconceived  she was immediately up and wanting to quit\\nthe table but so many were also moving that she could not get away\\nand mr knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously\\npushed towards her and resolutely swept away by her unexamined\\nshe was afterwards looking for her shawlfrank churchill was\\nlooking alsoit was growing dusk and the room was in confusion\\nand how they parted mr knightley could not tell\\n\\nhe remained at hartfield after all the rest his thoughts full\\nof what he had seen so full that when the candles came to assist\\nhis observations he mustyes he certainly must as a friend\\nan anxious friendgive emma some hint ask her some question\\nhe could not see her in a situation of such danger without trying to\\npreserve her  it was his duty\\n\\npray emma said he may i ask in what lay the great amusement\\nthe poignant sting of the last word given to you and miss fairfax\\ni saw the word and am curious to know how it could be so very\\nentertaining to the one and so very distressing to the other\\n\\nemma was extremely confused  she could not endure to give him the\\ntrue explanation for though her suspicions were by no means removed\\nshe was really ashamed of having ever imparted them\\n\\noh she cried in evident embarrassment it all meant nothing\\na mere joke among ourselves\\n\\nthe joke he replied gravely seemed confined to you\\nand mr churchill\\n\\nhe had hoped she would speak again but she did not  she would\\nrather busy herself about any thing than speak  he sat a little\\nwhile in doubt  a variety of evils crossed his mind  interference\\nfruitless interference  emmas confusion and the acknowledged intimacy\\nseemed to declare her affection engaged  yet he would speak\\nhe owed it to her to risk any thing that might be involved in\\nan unwelcome interference rather than her welfare to encounter\\nany thing rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause\\n\\nmy dear emma said he at last with earnest kindness do you\\nthink you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between\\nthe gentleman and lady we have been speaking of\\n\\nbetween mr frank churchill and miss fairfax  oh yes perfectly\\nwhy do you make a doubt of it\\n\\nhave you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her\\nor that she admired him\\n\\nnever never she cried with a most open eagernessnever for\\nthe twentieth part of a moment did such an idea occur to me\\nand how could it possibly come into your head\\n\\ni have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them\\ncertain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public\\n\\noh you amuse me excessively  i am delighted to find that you\\ncan vouchsafe to let your imagination wanderbut it will not do\\nvery sorry to check you in your first essaybut indeed it will\\nnot do  there is no admiration between them i do assure you\\nand the appearances which have caught you have arisen from some\\npeculiar circumstancesfeelings rather of a totally different nature\\nit is impossible exactly to explainthere is a good deal of\\nnonsense in itbut the part which is capable of being communicated\\nwhich is sense is that they are as far from any attachment or\\nadmiration for one another as any two beings in the world can be\\nthat is i presume it to be so on her side and i can answer for its\\nbeing so on his  i will answer for the gentlemans indifference\\n\\nshe spoke with a confidence which staggered with a satisfaction\\nwhich silenced mr knightley  she was in gay spirits and would\\nhave prolonged the conversation wanting to hear the particulars\\nof his suspicions every look described and all the wheres and hows\\nof a circumstance which highly entertained her  but his gaiety did\\nnot meet hers  he found he could not be useful and his feelings\\nwere too much irritated for talking  that he might not be irritated\\ninto an absolute fever by the fire which mr woodhouses tender\\nhabits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon\\nafterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness\\nand solitude of donwell abbey\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vi\\n\\n\\nafter being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from mr and\\nmrs suckling the highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\\nof hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn\\nno such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores\\nat present  in the daily interchange of news they must be again\\nrestricted to the other topics with which for a while the sucklings\\ncoming had been united such as the last accounts of mrs churchill\\nwhose health seemed every day to supply a different report\\nand the situation of mrs weston whose happiness it was to be hoped\\nmight eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child\\nas that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it\\n\\nmrs elton was very much disappointed  it was the delay of a great\\ndeal of pleasure and parade  her introductions and recommendations\\nmust all wait and every projected party be still only talked of\\nso she thought at firstbut a little consideration convinced\\nher that every thing need not be put off  why should not they\\nexplore to box hill though the sucklings did not come  they could\\ngo there again with them in the autumn  it was settled that they\\nshould go to box hill  that there was to be such a party had been\\nlong generally known  it had even given the idea of another\\nemma had never been to box hill she wished to see what every body\\nfound so well worth seeing and she and mr weston had agreed\\nto chuse some fine morning and drive thither  two or three more\\nof the chosen only were to be admitted to join them and it was to\\nbe done in a quiet unpretending elegant way infinitely superior\\nto the bustle and preparation the regular eating and drinking\\nand picnic parade of the eltons and the sucklings\\n\\nthis was so very well understood between them that emma could\\nnot but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing\\nfrom mr weston that he had been proposing to mrs elton as her\\nbrother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite\\nand go together and that as mrs elton had very readily acceded\\nto it so it was to be if she had no objection  now as her\\nobjection was nothing but her very great dislike of mrs elton\\nof which mr weston must already be perfectly aware it was not worth\\nbringing forward againit could not be done without a reproof\\nto him which would be giving pain to his wife and she found\\nherself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she\\nwould have done a great deal to avoid an arrangement which would\\nprobably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of\\nmrs eltons party  every feeling was offended and the forbearance\\nof her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity\\nin her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of mr westons temper\\n\\ni am glad you approve of what i have done said he very comfortably\\nbut i thought you would  such schemes as these are nothing\\nwithout numbers  one cannot have too large a party  a large party\\nsecures its own amusement  and she is a goodnatured woman after all\\none could not leave her out\\n\\nemma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private\\n\\nit was now the middle of june and the weather fine and mrs elton\\nwas growing impatient to name the day and settle with mr weston\\nas to pigeonpies and cold lamb when a lame carriagehorse threw\\nevery thing into sad uncertainty  it might be weeks it might be\\nonly a few days before the horse were useable but no preparations\\ncould be ventured on and it was all melancholy stagnation\\nmrs eltons resources were inadequate to such an attack\\n\\nis not this most vexations knightley she criedand such

like\\nit is to be a morning scheme you know knightley quite a simple thing\\ni shall wear a large bonnet and bring one of my little baskets\\nhanging on my arm  hereprobably this basket with pink ribbon\\nnothing can be more simple you see  and jane will have such another\\nthere is to be no form or paradea sort of gipsy party  we are\\nto walk about your gardens and gather the strawberries ourselves\\nand sit under treesand whatever else you may like to provide\\nit is to be all out of doorsa table spread in the shade you know\\nevery thing as natural and simple as possible  is not that your idea\\n\\nnot quite  my idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\\nthe table spread in the diningroom the nature and the simplicity\\nof gentlemen and ladies with their servants and furniture i think\\nis best observed by meals within doors  when you are tired of eating\\nstrawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house\\n\\nwellas you please only dont have a great set out  and by the bye\\ncan i or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion\\npray be sincere knightley  if you wish me to talk to mrs hodges\\nor to inspect anything\\n\\ni have not the least wish for it i thank you\\n\\nwellbut if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper\\nis extremely clever\\n\\ni will answer for it that mine thinks herself full as clever\\nand would spurn any bodys assistance\\n\\ni wish we had a donkey  the thing would be for us all to come\\non donkeys jane miss bates and meand my caro sposo walking by\\ni really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey  in a country\\nlife i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have\\never so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut\\nup at homeand very long walks you knowin summer there is dust\\nand in winter there is dirt\\n\\nyou will not find either between donwell and highbury\\ndonwell lane is never dusty and now it is perfectly dry  come on\\na donkey however if you prefer it  you can borrow mrs coles\\ni would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible\\n\\nthat i am sure you would  indeed i do you justice my good friend\\nunder that peculiar sort of dry blunt manner i know you have the\\nwarmest heart  as i tell mr e you are a thorough humourist\\nyes believe me knightley i am fully sensible of your attention\\nto me in the whole of this scheme  you have hit upon the very thing\\nto please me\\n\\nmr knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade\\nhe wished to persuade mr woodhouse as well as emma to join the party\\nand he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors\\nto eat would inevitably make him ill  mr woodhouse must not\\nunder the specious pretence of a morning drive and an hour or two\\nspent at donwell be tempted away to his misery\\n\\nhe was invited on good faith  no lurking horrors were to upbraid\\nhim for his easy credulity  he did consent  he had not been\\nat donwell for two years  some very fine morning he and emma\\nand harriet could go very well and he could sit still with\\nmrs weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens\\nhe did not suppose they could be damp now in the middle of\\nthe day  he should like to see the old house again exceedingly\\nand should be very happy to meet mr and mrs elton and any other\\nof his neighbourshe could not see any objection at all to his\\nand emmas and harriets going there some very fine morning\\nhe thought it very well done of mr knightley to invite them\\nvery kind and sensiblemuch cleverer than dining outhe was not\\nfond of dining out\\n\\nmr knightley was fortunate in every bodys most ready concurrence\\nthe invitation was everywhere so well received that it seemed as if\\nlike mrs elton they were all taking the scheme as a particular\\ncompliment to themselvesemma and harriet professed very high\\nexpectations of pleasure from it and mr weston unasked\\npromised to get frank over to join them if possible a proof\\nof approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with\\nmr knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad\\nto see him and mr weston engaged to lose no time in writing\\nand spare no arguments to induce him to come\\n\\nin the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast that the party\\nto box hill was again under happy consideration and at last donwell\\nwas settled for one day and box hill for the nextthe weather\\nappearing exactly right\\n\\nunder a bright midday sun at almost midsummer mr woodhouse\\nwas safely conveyed in his carriage with one window down\\nto partake of this alfresco party and in one of the most\\ncomfortable rooms in the abbey especially prepared for him by a\\nfire all the morning he was happily placed quite at his ease\\nready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved and advise\\nevery body to come and sit down and not to heat themselves\\nmrs weston who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired\\nand sit all the time with him remained when all the others\\nwere invited or persuaded out his patient listener and sympathiser\\n\\nit was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she\\nwas satisfied of her fathers comfort she was glad to leave him\\nand look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with\\nmore particular observation more exact understanding of a house\\nand grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family\\n\\nshe felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance\\nwith the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant\\nas she viewed the respectable size and style of the building\\nits suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered\\nits ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream\\nof which the abbey with all the old neglect of prospect\\nhad scarcely a sightand its abundance of timber in rows and avenues\\nwhich neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted upthe house\\nwas larger than hartfield and totally unlike it covering a good\\ndeal of ground rambling and irregular with many comfortable\\nand one or two handsome roomsit was just what it ought to be\\nand it looked what it wasand emma felt an increasing respect\\nfor it as the residence of a family of such true gentility\\nuntainted in blood and understandingsome faults of temper john\\nknightley had but isabella had connected herself unexceptionably\\nshe had given them neither men nor names nor places that could\\nraise a blush  these were pleasant feelings and she walked about\\nand indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did\\nand collect round the strawberrybedsthe whole party were assembled\\nexcepting frank churchill who was expected every moment

inquire if he were comeand she was a little uneasy\\nshe had some fears of his horse\\n\\nseats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged\\nto overhear what mrs elton and jane fairfax were talking of\\na situation a most desirable situation was in question  mrs elton\\nhad received notice of it that morning and was in raptures\\nit was not with mrs suckling it was not with mrs bragge\\nbut in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them  it was\\nwith a cousin of mrs bragge an acquaintance of mrs suckling\\na lady known at maple grove  delightful charming superior\\nfirst circles spheres lines ranks every thingand mrs elton\\nwas wild to have the offer closed with immediatelyon her side\\nall was warmth energy and triumphand she positively refused\\nto take her friends negative though miss fairfax continued\\nto assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing\\nrepeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before\\nstill mrs elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence\\nby the morrows posthow jane could bear it at all was astonishing\\nto emmashe did look vexed she did speak pointedlyand at last\\nwith a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal\\nshould not they walk  would not mr knightley shew them the gardens\\nall the gardensshe wished to see the whole extentthe pertinacity\\nof her friend seemed more than she could bear\\n\\nit was hot and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered\\ndispersed way scarcely any three together they insensibly\\nfollowed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short\\navenue of limes which stretching beyond the garden at an equal\\ndistance from the river seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds\\nit led to nothing nothing but a view at the end over a low stone\\nwall with high pillars which seemed intended in their erection\\nto give the appearance of an approach to the house which never had\\nbeen there  disputable however as might be the taste of such\\na termination it was in itself a charming walk and the view\\nwhich closed it extremely prettythe considerable slope at nearly\\nthe foot of which the abbey stood gradually acquired a steeper\\nform beyond its grounds and at half a mile distant was a bank\\nof considerable abruptness and grandeur well clothed with wood\\nand at the bottom of this bank favourably placed and sheltered\\nrose the abbey mill farm with meadows in front and the river\\nmaking a close and handsome curve around it\\n\\nit was a sweet viewsweet to the eye and the mind  english verdure\\nenglish culture english comfort seen under a sun bright\\nwithout being oppressive\\n\\nin this walk emma and mr weston found all the others assembled\\nand towards this view she immediately perceived mr knightley\\nand harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way\\nmr knightley and harrietit was an odd teteatete but she was\\nglad to see itthere had been a time when he would have scorned\\nher as a companion and turned from her with little ceremony\\nnow they seemed in pleasant conversation  there had been a time\\nalso when emma would have been sorry to see harriet in a spot\\nso favourable for the abbey mill farm but now she feared it not\\nit might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity\\nand beauty its rich pastures spreading flocks orchard in blossom\\nand light column of smoke ascendingshe joined them at the wall\\nand found them more engaged in talking than in looking around\\nhe was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc\\nand emma received a smile which seemed to say these are my\\nown concerns  i have a right to talk on such subjects without being\\nsuspected of introducing robert martinshe did not suspect him\\nit was too old a storyrobert martin had probably ceased to think\\nof harrietthey took a few turns together along the walkthe shade\\nwas most refreshing and emma found it the pleasantest part of\\nthe day\\n\\nthe next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat\\nand they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did\\nnot come  mrs weston looked and looked in vain  his father would\\nnot own himself uneasy and laughed at her fears but she could\\nnot be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare\\nhe had expressed himself as to coming with more than common certainty\\nhis aunt was so much better that he had not a doubt of getting\\nover to themmrs churchills state however as many were ready\\nto remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint\\nher nephew in the most reasonable dependenceand mrs weston\\nwas at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be\\nby some attack of mrs churchill that he was prevented coming\\nemma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration\\nshe behaved very well and betrayed no emotion\\n\\nthe cold repast was over and the party were to go out once more\\nto see what had not yet been seen the old abbey fishponds\\nperhaps get as far as the clover which was to be begun cutting\\non the morrow or at any rate have the pleasure of being hot\\nand growing cool againmr woodhouse who had already taken\\nhis little round in the highest part of the gardens where no\\ndamps from the river were imagined even by him stirred no more\\nand his daughter resolved to remain with him that mrs weston\\nmight be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety\\nwhich her spirits seemed to need\\n\\nmr knightley had done all in his power for mr woodhouses\\nentertainment  books of engravings drawers of medals cameos\\ncorals shells and every other family collection within his cabinets\\nhad been prepared for his old friend to while away the morning\\nand the kindness had perfectly answered  mr woodhouse had been\\nexceedingly well amused  mrs weston had been shewing them all to him\\nand now he would shew them all to emmafortunate in having no other\\nresemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw\\nfor he was slow constant and methodicalbefore this second looking\\nover was begun however emma walked into the hall for the sake\\nof a few moments free observation of the entrance and groundplot\\nof the houseand was hardly there when jane fairfax appeared\\ncoming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape\\nlittle expecting to meet miss woodhouse so soon there was a start\\nat first but miss woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of\\n\\nwill you be so kind said she when i am missed as to say\\nthat i am gone homei am going this momentmy aunt is not aware\\nhow late it is nor how long we have been absentbut i am sure we\\nshall be wanted and i am determined to go directlyi have said\\nnothing about it to any body  it would only be giving trouble\\nand distress  some are gone to the ponds and some to the lime walk\\ntill they all come in i shall not be missed and when they

twenty minutes\\n\\nbut it is too far indeed it is to be walking quite alone\\nlet my fathers servant go with youlet me order the carriage\\nit can be round in five minutes\\n\\nthank you thank youbut on no accounti would rather walk\\nand for me to be afraid of walking alonei who may so soon have\\nto guard others\\n\\nshe spoke with great agitation and emma very feelingly replied\\nthat can be no

fatiguequick walking will refresh memiss woodhouse we all\\nknow at times what it is to be wearied in spirits  mine i confess\\nare exhausted  the greatest kindness you can shew me will be to let\\nme have my own way and only say that i am gone when it is necessary\\n\\nemma had not another word to oppose  she saw it all and entering\\ninto her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately\\nand watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend  her parting\\nlook was gratefuland her parting words oh  miss woodhouse\\nthe comfort of being sometimes aloneseemed to burst from\\nan overcharged heart and to describe somewhat of the continual\\nendurance to be practised by her even towards some of those who\\nloved her best\\n\\nsuch a home indeed such an aunt said emma as she turned back\\ninto the hall again  i do pity you  and the more sensibility\\nyou betray of their just horrors the more i shall like you\\n\\njane had not been gone a quarter of an hour and they had only\\naccomplished some views of st marks place venice when frank\\nchurchill entered the room  emma had not been thinking of him\\nshe had forgotten to think of himbut she was very glad to see him\\nmrs weston would be at ease  the black mare was blameless\\nthey were right who had named mrs churchill as the cause\\nhe had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her\\na nervous seizure which had lasted some hoursand he had quite given\\nup every thought of coming till very lateand had he known how hot\\na ride he should have and how late with all his hurry he must be\\nhe believed he should not have come at all  the heat was excessive\\nhe had never suffered any thing like italmost wished he had staid\\nat homenothing killed him like heathe could bear any degree of cold\\netc but heat was intolerableand he sat down at the greatest\\npossible distance from the slight remains of mr woodhouses fire\\nlooking very deplorable\\n\\nyou will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma\\n\\nas soon as i am cooler i shall go back again  i could very\\nill be sparedbut such a point had been made of my coming\\nyou will all be going soon i suppose the whole party breaking up\\ni met one as i camemadness in such weatherabsolute madness\\n\\nemma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchills\\nstate might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being\\nout of humour  some people were always cross when they were hot\\nsuch might be his constitution and as she knew that eating\\nand drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints\\nshe recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance\\nof every thing in the diningroomand she humanely pointed out\\nthe door\\n\\nnohe should not eat  he was not hungry it would only make\\nhim hotter  in two minutes however he relented in his own favour\\nand muttering something about sprucebeer walked off  emma returned\\nall her attention to her father saying in secret\\n\\ni am glad i have done being in love with him  i should not like a\\nman who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning  harriets sweet\\neasy temper will not mind it\\n\\nhe was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came\\nback all the bettergrown quite cooland with good manners\\nlike himselfable to draw a chair close to them take an interest\\nin their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he\\nshould be so late  he was not in his best spirits but seemed\\ntrying to improve them and at last made himself talk nonsense\\nvery agreeably  they were looking over views in swisserland\\n\\nas soon as my aunt gets well i shall go abroad said he\\ni shall never be easy till i have seen some of these places\\nyou will have my sketches some time or other to look ator my tour\\nto reador my poem  i shall do something to expose myself\\n\\nthat may bebut not by sketches in swisserland  you will\\nnever go to swisserland  your uncle and aunt will never allow\\nyou to leave england\\n\\nthey may be induced to go too  a warm climate may be prescribed\\nfor her  i have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad\\ni assure you i have  i feel a strong persuasion this morning\\nthat i shall soon be abroad  i ought to travel  i am tired\\nof doing nothing  i want a change  i am serious miss woodhouse\\nwhatever your penetrating eyes may fancyi am sick of england\\nand would leave it tomorrow if i could\\n\\nyou are sick of prosperity and indulgence  cannot you invent\\na few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay\\n\\ni sick of prosperity and indulgence  you are quite mistaken\\ni do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged  i am\\nthwarted in every thing material  i do not consider myself at all\\na

returning and all were soon collected\\nwith some there was great joy at the sight of frank churchill\\nothers took it very composedly but there was a very general distress\\nand disturbance on miss fairfaxs disappearance being explained\\nthat it was time for every body to go concluded the subject and with\\na short final arrangement for the next days scheme they parted\\nfrank churchills little inclination to exclude himself increased\\nso much that his last words to emma were\\n\\nwellif you wish me to stay and join the party i will\\n\\nshe smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from\\nrichmond was to take him back before the following evening\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter vii\\n\\n\\nthey had a very fine day for box hill and all the other outward\\ncircumstances of arrangement accommodation and punctuality\\nwere in favour of a pleasant party  mr weston directed the whole\\nofficiating safely between hartfield and the vicarage and every\\nbody was in good time  emma and harriet went together miss bates\\nand her niece with the eltons the gentlemen on horseback\\nmrs weston remained with mr woodhouse  nothing was wanting\\nbut to be happy when they got there  seven miles were travelled\\nin expectation of enjoyment and every body had a burst of admiration\\non first arriving but in the general amount of the day there\\nwas deficiency  there was a languor a want of spirits a want of union\\nwhich could not be got over  they separated too much into parties\\nthe eltons walked together mr knightley took charge of miss\\nbates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill\\nand mr weston tried in vain to make them harmonise better  it seemed\\nat first an accidental division but it never materially varied\\nmr and mrs elton indeed shewed no unwillingness to mix\\nand be as agreeable as they could but during the two whole hours\\nthat were spent on the hill there seemed a principle of separation\\nbetween the other parties too strong for any fine prospects or any\\ncold collation or any cheerful mr weston to remove\\n\\nat first it was downright dulness to emma  she had never seen frank\\nchurchill so silent and stupid  he said nothing worth hearing\\nlooked without seeingadmired without intelligencelistened without\\nknowing what she said  while he was so dull it was no wonder that\\nharriet should be dull likewise and they were both insufferable\\n\\nwhen they all sat down it was better to her taste a great deal better\\nfor frank churchill grew talkative and gay making her his first object\\nevery distinguishing attention that could be paid was paid to her\\nto amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he\\ncared forand emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered\\nwas gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement\\nthe admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first\\nand most animating period of their acquaintance but which now\\nin her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most\\npeople looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english\\nword but flirtation could very well describe  mr frank churchill\\nand miss woodhouse flirted together excessively  they were laying\\nthemselves open to that very phraseand to having it sent off\\nin a letter to maple grove by one lady to ireland by another\\nnot that emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity\\nit was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected\\nshe laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him\\nfor his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship\\nadmiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning\\nback her heart  she still intended him for her friend\\n\\nhow much i am obliged to you said he for telling me to come today\\nif it had not been for you i should certainly have lost all the\\nhappiness of this party  i had quite determined to go away again\\n\\nyes you were very cross and i do not know what about\\nexcept that you were too late for the best strawberries\\ni was a kinder friend than you deserved  but you were humble\\nyou begged hard to be commanded to come\\n\\ndont say i was cross  i was fatigued  the heat overcame me\\n\\nit is hotter today\\n\\nnot to my feelings  i am perfectly comfortable today\\n\\nyou are comfortable because you are under command\\n\\nyour commandyes\\n\\nperhaps i intended you to say so but i meant selfcommand you had\\nsomehow or other broken bounds yesterday and run away from your\\nown management but today you are got back againand as i cannot\\nbe always with you it is best to believe your temper under your\\nown command rather than mine\\n\\nit comes to the same thing  i can have no selfcommand without\\na motive  you order me whether you speak or not  and you can\\nbe always with me  you are always with me\\n\\ndating from three oclock yesterday  my perpetual influence\\ncould not begin earlier or you would not have been so much\\nout of humour before\\n\\nthree oclock yesterday  that is your date  i thought i had seen\\nyou first in february\\n\\nyour gallantry is really unanswerable  but lowering her voice\\nnobody speaks except ourselves and it is rather too much to be\\ntalking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people\\n\\ni say nothing of which i am ashamed replied he with lively impudence\\ni saw you first in february  let every body on the hill hear me if\\nthey can  let my accents swell to mickleham on one side and dorking\\non the other  i saw you first in february  and then whispering\\nour companions are excessively stupid  what shall we do to rouse them\\nany nonsense will serve  they shall talk  ladies and gentlemen\\ni am ordered by miss woodhouse who wherever she is presides\\nto say that she desires to know what you are all thinking of\\n\\nsome laughed and answered goodhumouredly miss bates said a great deal\\nmrs elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouses presiding\\nmr knightleys answer was the most distinct\\n\\nis miss woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are\\nall thinking of\\n\\noh no nocried emma laughing as carelessly as she could\\nupon no account in the world  it is the very last thing i\\nwould stand the brunt of just now  let me hear any thing rather\\nthan what you are all thinking of  i will not say quite all\\nthere are one or two perhaps glancing at mr weston and harriet\\nwhose thoughts i might not be afraid of knowing\\n\\nit is a sort of thing cried mrs elton emphatically\\nwhich i should not have thought myself privileged to\\ninquire into  though perhaps as the chaperon of the party\\ni never was in any circleexploring partiesyoung ladiesmarried women\\n\\nher mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured\\nin reply\\n\\nvery true my love very true  exactly so indeedquite unheard of\\nbut some ladies say any thing  better pass it off as a joke\\nevery body knows what is due to you\\n\\nit will not do whispered frank to emma they are most\\nof them affronted  i will attack them with more address\\nladies and gentlemeni am ordered by miss woodhouse to say that she\\nwaives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of\\nand only requires something very entertaining from each of you\\nin a general way  here are seven of you besides myself who she\\nis pleased to say am very entertaining already and she only\\ndemands from each of you either one thing very clever be it prose\\nor verse original or repeatedor two things moderately clever\\nor three things very dull indeed and she engages to laugh heartily\\nat them all\\n\\noh very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy\\nthree things very dull indeed  that will just do for me you know\\ni shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever i open\\nmy mouth shant i looking round with the most goodhumoured\\ndependence on every bodys assentdo not you all think i shall\\n\\nemma could not resist\\n\\nah maam but there may be a difficulty  pardon mebut you\\nwill be limited as to numberonly three at once\\n\\nmiss bates deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner did not\\nimmediately catch her meaning but when it burst on her it could\\nnot anger though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her\\n\\nahwellto be sure  yes i see what she means turning to\\nmr knightley and i will try to hold my tongue  i must make\\nmyself very disagreeable or she would not have said such a thing\\nto an old friend\\n\\ni like your plan cried mr weston  agreed agreed  i will do\\nmy best  i am making a conundrum  how will a conundrum reckon\\n\\nlow i am afraid sir very low answered his sonbut we shall\\nbe indulgentespecially to any one who leads the way\\n\\nno no said emma it will not reckon low  a conundrum of\\nmr westons shall clear him and his next neighbour  come sir\\npray let me hear it\\n\\ni doubt its being very clever myself said mr weston\\nit is too much a matter of fact but here it iswhat two letters\\nof the alphabet are there that express perfection\\n\\nwhat two lettersexpress perfection  i am sure i do not know\\n\\nah you will never guess  you to emma i am certain will\\nnever guessi will tell youm and aemmado you understand\\n\\nunderstanding and gratification came together  it might be a very\\nindifferent piece of wit but emma found a great deal to laugh\\nat and enjoy in itand so did frank and harrietit did not seem\\nto touch the rest of the party equally some looked very stupid\\nabout it and mr knightley gravely said\\n\\nthis explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted and mr weston\\nhas done very well for himself but he must have knocked up every\\nbody else  perfection should not have come quite so soon\\n\\noh for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs elton\\ni really cannot attempti am not at all fond of the sort of thing\\ni had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name which i was not\\nat all pleased with  i knew who it came from  an abominable puppy\\nyou know who i mean nodding to her husband these kind of things\\nare very well at christmas when one is sitting round the fire\\nbut quite out of place in my opinion when one is exploring\\nabout the country in summer  miss woodhouse must excuse me\\ni am not one of those who have witty things at every bodys service\\ni do not pretend to be a wit  i have a great deal of vivacity\\nin my own way but i really must be allowed to judge when to speak\\nand when to hold my tongue  pass us if you please mr churchill\\npass mr e knightley jane and myself  we have nothing clever to say\\nnot one of us\\n\\nyes yes pray pass me added her husband with a sort of\\nsneering consciousness i have nothing to say that can entertain\\nmiss woodhouse or any other young lady  an old married man\\nquite good for nothing  shall we walk augusta\\n\\nwith all my heart  i am really tired of exploring so long\\non one spot  come jane take my other arm\\n\\njane declined it however and the husband and wife walked off\\nhappy couple said frank churchill as soon as they were out\\nof hearinghow well they suit one

her to listen\\n\\nyou were speaking said he gravely  she recovered her voice\\n\\ni was only going to observe that though such unfortunate circumstances\\ndo sometimes occur both to men and women i cannot imagine them\\nto be very frequent  a hasty and imprudent attachment may arise\\nbut there is generally time to recover from it afterwards  i would\\nbe understood to mean that it can be only weak irresolute characters\\nwhose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance\\nwho will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience\\nan oppression for ever\\n\\nhe made no answer

all my heart  i am quite ready\\ni was ready to have gone with her but this will do just as well\\nwe shall soon overtake her  there she isno thats somebody else\\nthats one of the ladies in the irish car party not at all like her\\nwell i declare\\n\\nthey walked off followed in half a minute by mr knightley\\nmr weston his son emma and harriet only remained and the young\\nmans spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant  even emma grew\\ntired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather\\nwalking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone\\nand quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful\\nviews beneath her  the appearance of the servants looking out\\nfor them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight\\nand even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart\\nand the solicitude of mrs elton to have her carriage first\\nwere gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was\\nto close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure\\nsuch another scheme composed of so many illassorted people\\nshe hoped never to be betrayed into again\\n\\nwhile waiting for the carriage she found mr knightley by her side\\nhe looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said\\n\\nemma i must once more speak to you as i have been used to do\\na privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but i must still\\nuse it  i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance\\nhow could you be so unfeeling to miss bates  how could you be so\\ninsolent in your wit to a woman of her character age and situation\\nemma i had not thought it possible\\n\\nemma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off\\n\\nnay how could i help saying what i didnobody could have helped it\\nit was not so very bad  i dare say she did not understand me\\n\\ni assure you she did  she felt your full meaning  she has talked\\nof it since  i wish you could have heard how she talked of it\\nwith what candour and generosity  i wish you could have heard her\\nhonouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions\\nas she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father\\nwhen her society must be so irksome\\n\\noh cried emma i know there is not a better creature in the world\\nbut you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are\\nmost unfortunately blended in her\\n\\nthey are blended said he i acknowledge and were she prosperous\\ni could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous\\nover the good  were she a woman of fortune i would leave every\\nharmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you\\nfor any liberties of manner  were she your equal in situation\\nbut emma consider how far this is from being the case  she is poor\\nshe has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live\\nto old age must probably sink more  her situation should secure\\nyour compassion  it was badly done indeed  you whom she had known\\nfrom an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her\\nnotice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits\\nand the pride of the moment laugh at her humble herand before\\nher niece tooand before others many of whom certainly some\\nwould be entirely guided by your treatment of herthis is not\\npleasant to you emmaand it is very far from pleasant to me\\nbut i must i willi will tell you truths while i can\\nsatisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel\\nand trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice\\nthan you can do now\\n\\nwhile they talked they were advancing towards the carriage\\nit was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in\\nhe had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted\\nand her tongue motionless  they were combined only of anger\\nagainst herself mortification and deep concern  she had not\\nbeen able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back\\nfor a moment overcomethen reproaching herself for having taken\\nno leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness\\nshe looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference\\nbut it was just too late  he had turned away and the horses were\\nin motion  she continued to look back but in vain and soon\\nwith what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill\\nand every thing left far behind  she was vexed beyond what could\\nhave been expressedalmost beyond what she could conceal\\nnever had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance\\nin her life  she was most forcibly struck  the truth of this\\nrepresentation there was no denying  she felt it at her heart\\nhow could she have been so brutal so cruel to miss bates  how could\\nshe have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued\\nand how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude\\nof concurrence of common kindness\\n\\ntime did not compose her  as she reflected more she seemed\\nbut to feel it more  she never had been so depressed  happily it\\nwas not necessary to speak  there was only harriet who seemed not\\nin spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and emma\\nfelt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home\\nwithout being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter viii\\n\\n\\nthe wretchedness of a scheme to box hill was in emmas thoughts all\\nthe evening  how it might be considered by the rest of the party\\nshe could not tell  they in their different homes and their different\\nways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it\\nwas a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational\\nsatisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection\\nthan any she had ever passed  a whole evening of backgammon with\\nher father was felicity to it  there indeed lay real pleasure\\nfor there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twentyfour\\nto his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree\\nof his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her\\ngeneral conduct be open to any severe reproach  as a daughter\\nshe hoped she was not without a heart  she hoped no one could\\nhave said to her how could you be so unfeeling to your father\\ni must i will tell you truths while i can  miss bates should\\nnever againno never  if attention in future could do away\\nthe past she might hope to be forgiven  she had been often remiss\\nher conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought\\nthan fact scornful ungracious  but it should be so no more\\nin the warmth of true contrition she would call upon her the\\nvery next morning and it should be the beginning on her side\\nof a regular equal kindly intercourse\\n\\nshe was just as determined when the morrow came and went early\\nthat nothing might prevent her  it was not unlikely she thought\\nthat she might see mr knightley in her way or perhaps he might\\ncome in while she were paying her visit  she had no objection\\nshe would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence so justly\\nand truly hers  her eyes were towards donwell as she walked but she\\nsaw him not\\n\\nthe ladies were all at home  she had never rejoiced at the sound\\nbefore nor ever before entered the passage nor walked up the stairs\\nwith any wish of giving pleasure but in conferring obligation\\nor of deriving it except in subsequent ridicule\\n\\nthere was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking\\nshe heard miss batess voice something was to be done in a hurry\\nthe maid looked frightened and awkward hoped she would be pleased\\nto wait a moment and then ushered her in too soon  the aunt and\\nniece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room  jane she had\\na distinct glimpse of looking extremely ill and before the door\\nhad shut them out she heard miss bates saying well my dear\\ni shall say you are laid down upon the bed and i am sure you are\\nill enough\\n\\npoor old mrs bates civil and humble as usual looked as if she\\ndid not quite understand what was going on\\n\\ni am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know\\nthey tell me she is well  i dare say my daughter will be here presently\\nmiss woodhouse  i hope you find a chair  i

miss\\nbates keeping away from her  but miss bates soon camevery happy\\nand obligedbut emmas conscience told her that there was not the\\nsame cheerful volubility as beforeless ease of look and manner\\na very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead\\nthe way to a return of old feelings  the touch seemed immediate\\n\\nah  miss woodhouse how kind you arei suppose you have heard\\nand are come to give us joy  this does not seem much like joy\\nindeed in metwinkling away a tear or twobut it will be\\nvery trying for us to part with her after having had her so long\\nand she has a dreadful headache just now writing all the morning\\nsuch long letters you know to be written to colonel campbell\\nand mrs dixon  my dear said i you will blind yourself\\nfor tears were in her eyes perpetually  one cannot wonder\\none cannot wonder  it is a great change and though she is\\namazingly fortunatesuch a situation i suppose as no young woman\\nbefore ever met with on first going outdo not think us ungrateful\\nmiss woodhouse for such surprising good fortuneagain dispersing\\nher tearsbut poor dear soul if you were to see what a headache\\nshe has  when one is in great pain you know one cannot feel\\nany blessing quite as it may deserve  she is as low as possible\\nto look at her nobody would think how delighted and happy she\\nis to have secured such a situation  you will excuse her not\\ncoming to youshe is not ableshe is gone into her own room\\ni want her to lie down upon the bed  my dear said i i shall\\nsay you are laid down upon the bed  but however she is not\\nshe is walking about the room  but now that she has written\\nher letters she says she shall soon be well  she will be extremely\\nsorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will\\nexcuse her  you were kept waiting at the doori was quite ashamed\\nbut somehow there was a little bustlefor it so happened that we\\nhad not heard the knock and till you were on the stairs we did\\nnot know any body was coming  it is only mrs cole said i\\ndepend upon it  nobody else would come so early  well said she\\nit must be borne some time or other and it may as well be now\\nbut then patty came in and said it was you  oh said i\\nit is miss woodhouse  i am sure you will like to see her\\ni can see nobody said she and up she got and would go away\\nand that was what made us keep you waitingand extremely sorry\\nand ashamed we were  if you must go my dear said i you must\\nand i will say you are laid down upon the bed\\n\\nemma was most sincerely interested  her heart had been long growing\\nkinder towards jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted\\nas a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing\\nbut pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle\\nsensations of the past obliged her to admit that jane might very\\nnaturally resolve on seeing mrs cole or any other steady friend\\nwhen she might not bear to see herself  she spoke as she felt\\nwith earnest regret and solicitudesincerely wishing that the\\ncircumstances which she collected from miss bates to be now actually\\ndetermined on might be as much for miss fairfaxs advantage\\nand comfort as possible  it must be a severe trial to them all\\nshe had understood it was to be delayed till colonel campbells return\\n\\nso very kind replied miss bates  but you are always kind\\n\\nthere was no bearing such an always and to break through her\\ndreadful gratitude emma made the direct inquiry of\\n\\nwheremay i askis miss fairfax going\\n\\nto a mrs smallridgecharming womanmost superiorto have\\nthe charge of her three little girlsdelightful children\\nimpossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort\\nif we except perhaps mrs sucklings own family and mrs bragges\\nbut mrs smallridge is intimate with both and in the very\\nsame neighbourhoodlives only four miles from maple grove\\njane will be only four miles from maple grove\\n\\nmrs elton i suppose has been the person to whom miss fairfax owes\\n\\nyes our good mrs elton  the most indefatigable true friend\\nshe would not take a denial  she would not let jane say no for\\nwhen jane first heard of it it was the day before yesterday\\nthe very morning we were at donwell when jane first heard of it\\nshe was quite decided against accepting the offer and for the\\nreasons you mention exactly as you say she had made up her mind\\nto close with nothing till colonel campbells return and nothing\\nshould induce her to enter into any engagement at presentand so she\\ntold mrs elton over and over againand i am sure i had no more\\nidea that she would change her mindbut that good mrs elton\\nwhose judgment never fails her saw farther than i did  it is not\\nevery body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did\\nand refuse to take janes answer but she positively declared she\\nwould not write any such denial yesterday as jane wished her\\nshe would waitand sure enough yesterday evening it was all\\nsettled that jane should go  quite a surprize to me  i had not\\nthe least ideajane took mrs elton aside and told her at once\\nthat upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridges situation\\nshe had come to the resolution of accepting iti did not know a word\\nof it till it was all settled\\n\\nyou spent the evening with mrs elton\\n\\nyes all of us mrs elton would have us come  it was settled so\\nupon the hill while we were walking about with mr knightley\\nyou must all spend your evening with us said shei positively must\\nhave you all come\\n\\nmr knightley was there too was he\\n\\nno not mr knightley he declined it from the first and though i\\nthought he would come because mrs elton declared she would not let\\nhim off he did notbut my mother and jane and i were all there\\nand a very agreeable evening we had  such kind friends you know\\nmiss woodhouse one must always find agreeable though every body\\nseemed rather fagged after the mornings party  even pleasure\\nyou know is fatiguingand i cannot say that any of them seemed\\nvery much to have enjoyed it  however i shall always think it\\na very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends\\nwho included me in it\\n\\nmiss fairfax i suppose though you were not aware of it had been\\nmaking up her mind the whole day\\n\\ni dare say she had\\n\\nwhenever the time may come it must be unwelcome to her and all\\nher friendsbut i hope her engagement will have every alleviation\\nthat is possiblei mean as to the character and manners of the family\\n\\nthank you dear miss woodhouse  yes indeed there is every thing\\nin the world that can make her happy in it  except the sucklings\\nand bragges there is not such another nursery establishment\\nso liberal and elegant in all mrs eltons acquaintance\\nmrs smallridge a most delightful womana style of living almost\\nequal to maple groveand as to the children except the little\\nsucklings and little bragges there are not such elegant sweet\\nchildren anywhere  jane will be treated with such regard and kindness\\nit will be nothing but pleasure a life of pleasureand her salary\\ni really cannot venture to name her salary to you miss woodhouse\\neven you used as you are to great sums would hardly believe that\\nso much could be given to a young person like jane\\n\\nah madam cried emma if other children are at all like what i\\nremember to have been myself i should think five times the amount\\nof what i have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions\\ndearly earned\\n\\nyou are so noble in your ideas\\n\\nand when is miss fairfax to leave you\\n\\nvery soon very soon indeed thats the worst of it\\nwithin a fortnight  mrs smallridge is in a great hurry  my poor\\nmother does not know how to bear it  so then i try to put it out of\\nher thoughts and say come maam do not let us think about it any more\\n\\nher friends must all be sorry to lose her and will not colonel\\nand mrs campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself\\nbefore their return\\n\\nyes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such\\na situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining\\ni was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying\\nto mrs elton and when mrs elton at the same moment came congratulating\\nme upon it  it was before teastayno it could not be before tea\\nbecause we were just going to cardsand yet it was before tea\\nbecause i remember thinkingoh no now i recollect now i have it\\nsomething happened before tea but not that  mr elton was called\\nout of the room before tea old john abdys son wanted to speak\\nwith him  poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk\\nto my poor father twentyseven years and now poor old man he is\\nbedridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints\\ni must go and see him today and so will jane i am sure if she\\ngets out at all  and poor johns son came to talk to mr elton\\nabout relief from the parish he is very well to do himself\\nyou know being head man at the crown ostler and every thing\\nof that sort but still he cannot keep his father without some help\\nand so when mr elton came back he told us what john ostler\\nhad been telling him and then it came out about the chaise having\\nbeen sent to randalls to take mr frank churchill to richmond\\nthat was what happened before tea  it was after tea that jane spoke\\nto mrs elton\\n\\nmiss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly\\nnew this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it\\npossible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars\\nof mr frank churchills going she proceeded to give them all\\nit was of no consequence\\n\\nwhat mr elton had learned from the ostler on the subject being the\\naccumulation of the ostlers own knowledge and the knowledge\\nof the servants at randalls was that a messenger had come over\\nfrom richmond soon after the return of the party from box hill\\nwhich messenger however had been no more than was expected\\nand that mr churchill had sent his nephew a few lines containing\\nupon the whole a tolerable account of mrs churchill and only\\nwishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early\\nbut that mr frank churchill having resolved to go home directly\\nwithout waiting at all and his horse seeming to have got a cold\\ntom had been sent off immediately for the crown chaise and the\\nostler had stood out and seen it pass by the boy going a good pace\\nand driving very steady\\n\\nthere was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest\\nand it caught emmas attention only as it united with the subject\\nwhich already engaged her mind  the contrast between mrs churchills\\nimportance in the world and jane fairfaxs struck her one was\\nevery thing the other nothingand she sat musing on the difference\\nof womans destiny and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed\\ntill roused by miss batess saying\\n\\naye i see what you are thinking of the pianoforte  what is to become\\nof thatvery true  poor dear jane was talking of it just now\\nyou must go said she  you and i must part  you will have no\\nbusiness herelet it stay however said she give it houseroom\\ntill colonel campbell comes back  i shall talk about it to him\\nhe will settle for me he will help me out of all my difficulties\\nand to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his\\npresent or his daughters\\n\\nnow emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance\\nof all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing\\nthat she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been\\nlong enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could\\nventure to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter ix\\n\\n\\nemmas pensive meditations as she walked home were not interrupted\\nbut on entering the parlour she found those who must rouse her\\nmr knightley and harriet had arrived during her absence and were\\nsitting with her fathermr knightley immediately got up and in a\\nmanner decidedly graver than usual said\\n\\ni would not go away without seeing you but i have no time to spare\\nand therefore must now be gone directly  i am going to london\\nto spend a few days with john and isabella  have you any thing to\\nsend or say besides the love which nobody carries\\n\\nnothing at all  but is not this a sudden scheme\\n\\nyesratheri have been thinking of it some little time\\n\\nemma was sure he had not forgiven her he looked unlike himself\\ntime however she thought would tell him that they ought to be\\nfriends again  while he stood as if meaning to go but not going\\nher father began his inquiries\\n\\nwell my dear and did you get there safelyand how did you\\nfind my worthy old friend and her daughteri dare say they must\\nhave been very much obliged to you for coming  dear emma has been\\nto call on mrs and miss bates mr knightley as i told you before\\nshe is always so attentive to them\\n\\nemmas colour was heightened by this unjust praise and with a smile\\nand shake of the head which spoke much she looked at mr knightley\\nit seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour\\nas if his eyes received the truth from hers and all that had\\npassed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured\\nhe looked at her with a glow of regard  she was warmly gratified\\nand in another moment still more so by a little movement of\\nmore than common friendliness on his parthe took her hand\\nwhether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say\\nshe might perhaps have rather offered itbut he took her hand\\npressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips\\nwhen from some fancy or other he suddenly let it gowhy he should feel\\nsuch a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done\\nshe could not perceivehe would have judged better she thought\\nif he had not stoppedthe intention however was indubitable\\nand whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry\\nor however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more\\nit was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature\\nshe could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction\\nit spoke such perfect amityhe left them immediately afterwards\\ngone in a moment  he always moved with the alertness of a mind which\\ncould neither be undecided nor dilatory but now he seemed more sudden\\nthan usual in his disappearance\\n\\nemma could not regret her having gone to miss bates but she wished\\nshe had left her ten minutes earlierit would have been a great\\npleasure to talk over jane fairfaxs situation with mr knightley\\nneither would she regret that he should be going to brunswick square\\nfor she knew how much his visit would be enjoyedbut it might have\\nhappened at a better timeand to have had longer notice of it\\nwould have been pleasanterthey parted thorough friends however\\nshe could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance\\nand his unfinished gallantryit was all done to assure her that she\\nhad fully recovered his good opinionhe had been sitting with them\\nhalf an hour she found  it was a pity that she had not come\\nback earlier\\n\\nin the hope of diverting her fathers thoughts from the disagreeableness\\nof mr knightleys going to london and going so suddenly\\nand going on horseback which she knew would be all very bad\\nemma communicated her news of jane fairfax and her dependence\\non the effect was justified it supplied a very useful check\\ninterested without disturbing him  he had long made up his mind to jane\\nfairfaxs going out as governess and could talk of it cheerfully\\nbut mr knightleys going to london had been an unexpected blow\\n\\ni am very glad indeed my dear to hear she is to be so\\ncomfortably settled  mrs elton is very goodnatured and agreeable\\nand i dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought\\nto be  i hope it is a dry situation and that her health\\nwill be taken good care of  it ought to be a first object\\nas i am sure poor miss taylors always was with me  you know\\nmy dear she is going to be to this new lady what miss taylor\\nwas to us  and i hope she will be better off in one respect\\nand not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long\\n\\nthe following day brought news from richmond to throw every\\nthing else into the background  an express arrived at randalls\\nto announce the death of mrs churchill  though her nephew\\nhad had no particular reason to hasten back on her account\\nshe had not lived above sixandthirty hours after his return\\na sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded\\nby her general state had carried her off after a short struggle\\nthe great mrs churchill was no more\\n\\nit was felt as such things must be felt  every body had a\\ndegree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed\\nsolicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time\\ncuriosity to know where she would be buried  goldsmith tells us\\nthat when lovely woman stoops to folly she has nothing to do\\nbut to die and when she stoops to be disagreeable it is equally\\nto be recommended as a clearer of illfame mrs churchill\\nafter being disliked at least twentyfive years was now spoken of\\nwith compassionate allowances  in one point she was fully justified\\nshe had never been admitted before to be seriously ill  the event\\nacquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness\\nof imaginary complaints\\n\\npoor mrs churchill no doubt she had been suffering a great deal\\nmore than any body had ever supposedand continual pain would try\\nthe temper  it was a sad eventa great shockwith all her faults\\nwhat would mr churchill do without her  mr churchills loss\\nwould be dreadful indeed  mr churchill would never get over it\\neven mr weston shook his head and looked solemn and said\\nah poor woman who would have thought it and resolved that his\\nmourning should be as handsome as possible and his wife sat sighing\\nand moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense\\ntrue and steady  how it would affect frank was among the earliest\\nthoughts of both  it was also a very early speculation with emma\\nthe character of mrs churchill the grief of her husbandher mind\\nglanced over them both with awe and compassionand then rested\\nwith lightened feelings on how frank might be affected by the event\\nhow benefited how freed  she saw in a moment all the possible good\\nnow an attachment to harriet smith would have nothing to encounter\\nmr churchill independent of his wife was feared by nobody\\nan easy guidable man to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew\\nall that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form\\nthe attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel\\nno certainty of its being already formed\\n\\nharriet behaved extremely well on the occasion with great selfcommand\\nwhat ever she might feel of brighter hope she betrayed nothing  emma was\\ngratified to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character\\nand refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance\\nthey spoke therefore of mrs churchills death with mutual forbearance\\n\\nshort letters from frank were received at randalls communicating\\nall that was immediately important of their state and plans\\nmr churchill was better than could be expected and their\\nfirst removal on the departure of the funeral for yorkshire\\nwas to be to the house of a very old friend in windsor to whom\\nmr churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years\\nat present there was nothing to be done for harriet good wishes\\nfor the future were all that could yet be possible on emmas side\\n\\nit was a more pressing concern to shew attention to jane fairfax\\nwhose prospects were closing while harriets opened and whose\\nengagements now allowed of no delay in any one at highbury who wished\\nto shew her kindnessand with emma it was grown into a first wish\\nshe had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness\\nand the person whom she had been so many months neglecting was now\\nthe very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of\\nregard or sympathy  she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew\\na value for her society and testify respect and consideration\\nshe resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at hartfield\\na note was written to urge it  the invitation was refused and by\\na verbal message  miss fairfax was not well enough to write\\nand when mr perry called at hartfield the same morning\\nit appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited\\nthough against her own consent by himself and that she was suffering\\nunder severe headaches and a nervous fever to a degree which made\\nhim doubt the possibility of her going to mrs smallridges at the\\ntime proposed  her health seemed for the moment completely deranged\\nappetite quite goneand though there were no absolutely\\nalarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint\\nwhich was the standing apprehension of the family mr perry was\\nuneasy about her  he thought she had undertaken more than she\\nwas equal to and that she felt it so herself though she would\\nnot own it  her spirits seemed overcome  her present home\\nhe could not but observe was unfavourable to a nervous disorder\\nconfined always to one roomhe could have wished it otherwise\\nand her good aunt though his very old friend he must acknowledge\\nto be not the best companion for an invalid of that description\\nher care and attention could not be questioned they were in fact\\nonly too great  he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more\\nevil than good from them  emma listened with the warmest concern\\ngrieved for her more and more and looked around eager to discover\\nsome way of being useful  to take herbe it only an hour\\nor twofrom her aunt to give her change of air and scene\\nand quiet rational conversation even for an hour or two\\nmight do her good and the following morning she wrote again to say\\nin the most feeling language she could command that she would\\ncall for her in the carriage at any hour that jane would name\\nmentioning that she had mr perrys decided opinion in favour\\nof such exercise for his patient  the answer was only in this\\nshort note\\n\\nmiss fairfaxs compliments and thanks but is quite unequal\\nto any exercise\\n\\nemma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it\\nwas impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality\\nshewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she\\nmight best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted\\nin spite of the answer therefore she ordered the carriage and drove\\nto mrs batess in the hope that jane would be induced to join her\\nbut it would not domiss bates came to the

was obliged to return without success\\njane was quite unpersuadable the mere proposal of going out\\nseemed to make her worseemma wished she could have seen her\\nand tried her own powers but almost before she could hint the wish\\nmiss bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on\\nno account to let miss woodhouse in  indeed the truth was\\nthat poor dear jane could not bear to see any bodyany body at all\\nmrs elton indeed could not be deniedand mrs cole had made\\nsuch a pointand mrs perry had said so muchbut except them\\njane would really see nobody\\n\\nemma did not want to be classed with the mrs eltons the mrs perrys\\nand the mrs coles who would force themselves anywhere\\nneither could she feel any right of preference herself\\nshe submitted therefore and only questioned miss bates farther\\nas to her nieces appetite and diet which she longed to be able\\nto assist  on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy\\nand very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing\\nmr perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could\\ncommand and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful\\n\\nemma on reaching home called the housekeeper directly to an\\nexamination of her stores and some arrowroot of very superior quality\\nwas speedily despatched to miss bates with a most friendly note\\nin half an hour the arrowroot was returned with a thousand thanks\\nfrom miss bates but dear jane would not be satisfied without its\\nbeing sent back it was a thing she could not takeand moreover\\nshe insisted on her saying that she was not at all in want of any thing\\n\\nwhen emma afterwards heard that jane fairfax had been seen wandering\\nabout the meadows at some distance from highbury on the afternoon\\nof the very day on which she had under the plea of being unequal\\nto any exercise so peremptorily refused to go out with her in\\nthe carriage she could have no doubtputting every thing together\\nthat jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her  she was sorry\\nvery sorry  her heart was grieved for a state which seemed\\nbut the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits\\ninconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified\\nher that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed\\nso little worthy as a friend  but she had the consolation of knowing\\nthat her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself\\nthat could mr knightley have been privy to all her attempts\\nof assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart\\nhe would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter x\\n\\n\\none morning about ten days after mrs churchills decease\\nemma was called downstairs to mr weston who could not stay\\nfive minutes and wanted particularly to speak with her\\nhe met her at the parlourdoor and hardly asking her how she did\\nin the natural key of his voice sunk it immediately to say\\nunheard by her father\\n\\ncan you come to randalls at any time this morningdo if it\\nbe possible  mrs weston wants to see you  she must see you\\n\\nis she unwell\\n\\nno no not at allonly a little agitated  she would have\\nordered the carriage and come to you but she must see you alone\\nand that you knownodding towards her fatherhumphcan you come\\n\\ncertainly  this moment if you please  it is impossible to\\nrefuse what you ask in such a way  but what can be the matter\\nis she really not ill\\n\\ndepend upon mebut ask no more questions  you will know it\\nall in time  the most unaccountable business  but hush hush\\n\\nto guess what all this meant was impossible even for emma\\nsomething really important seemed announced by his looks\\nbut as her friend was well she endeavoured not to be uneasy\\nand settling it with her father that she would take her walk now\\nshe and mr weston were soon out of the house together and on\\ntheir way at a quick pace for randalls\\n\\nnowsaid emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates\\nnow mr weston do let me know what has happened\\n\\nno nohe gravely replieddont ask me  i promised my wife\\nto leave it all to her  she will break it to you better than i can\\ndo not be impatient emma it will all come out too soon\\n\\nbreak it to me cried emma standing still with terror\\ngood godmr weston tell me at oncesomething has happened\\nin brunswick square  i know it has  tell me i charge you tell\\nme this moment what it is\\n\\nno indeed you are mistaken\\n\\nmr weston do not trifle with meconsider how many of my dearest\\nfriends are now in brunswick square  which of them is it\\ni charge you by all that is sacred not to attempt concealment\\n\\nupon my word emma\\n\\nyour wordwhy not your honourwhy not say upon your honour\\nthat it has nothing to do with any of them  good heavenswhat can\\nbe to be broke to me that does not relate to one of that family\\n\\nupon my honour said he very seriously it does not  it is not\\nin the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name\\nof knightley\\n\\nemmas courage returned and she walked on\\n\\ni was wrong he continued in talking of its being broke to you\\ni should not have used the expression  in fact it does not concern you\\nit concerns only myselfthat is we hopehumphin short\\nmy dear emma there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it\\ni dont say that it is not a disagreeable businessbut things might\\nbe much worseif we walk fast we shall soon be at randalls\\n\\nemma found that she must wait and now it required little effort\\nshe asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy\\nand that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some\\nmoney concernsomething just come to light of a disagreeable\\nnature in the circumstances of the familysomething which the late\\nevent at richmond had brought forward  her fancy was very active\\nhalf a dozen natural children perhapsand poor frank cut off\\nthis though very undesirable would be no matter of agony to her\\nit inspired little more than an animating curiosity\\n\\nwho is that gentleman on horseback said she as they proceeded\\nspeaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with\\nany other view\\n\\ni do not knowone of the otwaysnot frankit is not frank\\ni assure you  you will not see him  he is half way to windsor\\nby this time\\n\\nhas your son been with you then\\n\\noh yesdid not you knowwell well never mind\\n\\nfor a moment he was silent and then added in a tone much more\\nguarded and demure\\n\\nyes frank came over this morning just to ask us how we did\\n\\nthey hurried on and were speedily at randallswell my dear\\nsaid he as they entered the roomi have brought her and now\\ni hope you will soon be better  i shall leave you together\\nthere is no use in delay  i shall not be far off if you want me\\nand emma distinctly heard him add in a lower tone before he\\nquitted the roomi have been as good as my word  she has not the\\nleast idea\\n\\nmrs weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation\\nthat emmas uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone\\nshe eagerly said\\n\\nwhat is it my dear friend  something of a very unpleasant nature\\ni find has occurreddo let me know directly what it is\\ni have been walking all this way in complete suspense  we both\\nabhor suspense  do not let mine continue longer  it will do you\\ngood to speak of your distress whatever it may be\\n\\nhave you indeed no idea said mrs weston in a trembling voice\\ncannot you my dear emmacannot you form a guess as to what you\\nare to hear\\n\\nso far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess\\n\\nyou are right  it does relate to him and i will tell you directly\\nresuming her work and seeming resolved against looking up\\nhe has been here this very morning on a most extraordinary errand\\nit is impossible to express our surprize  he came to speak to his\\nfather on a subjectto announce an attachment\\n\\nshe stopped to breathe  emma thought first of herself and then\\nof harriet\\n\\nmore than an attachment indeed resumed mrs weston an engagement\\na positive engagementwhat will you say emmawhat will any\\nbody say when it is known that frank churchill and miss fairfax\\nare engagednay that they have been long engaged\\n\\nemma even jumped with surprizeand horrorstruck exclaimed\\n\\njane fairfaxgood god  you are not serious  you do not mean it\\n\\nyou may well be amazed returned mrs weston still averting her eyes\\nand talking on with eagerness that emma might have time to recover\\nyou may well be amazed  but it is even so  there has been a solemn\\nengagement between them ever since octoberformed at weymouth\\nand kept a secret from every body  not a creature knowing it\\nbut themselvesneither the campbells nor her family nor his\\nit is so wonderful that though perfectly convinced of the fact\\nit is yet almost incredible to myself  i can hardly believe it\\ni thought i knew him\\n\\nemma scarcely heard what was saidher mind was divided between\\ntwo ideasher own former conversations with him about miss fairfax\\nand poor harrietand for some time she could only exclaim\\nand require confirmation repeated confirmation\\n\\nwell said she at last trying to recover herself this is a\\ncircumstance which i must think of at least half a day before i\\ncan at all comprehend it  whatengaged to her all the winter\\nbefore either of them came to highbury\\n\\nengaged since octobersecretly engagedit has hurt me\\nemma very much  it has hurt his father equally  some part\\nof his conduct we cannot excuse\\n\\nemma pondered a moment and then replied i will not pretend\\nnot to understand you and to give you all the relief in my power\\nbe assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me\\nas you are apprehensive of\\n\\nmrs weston looked up afraid to believe but emmas countenance\\nwas as steady as her words\\n\\nthat you may have less difficulty in believing this boast of my\\npresent perfect indifference she continued i will farther tell you\\nthat there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance\\nwhen i did like him when i was very much disposed to be\\nattached to himnay was attachedand how it came to cease\\nis perhaps the wonder  fortunately however it did cease\\ni have really for some time past for at least these three months\\ncared nothing about him  you may believe me mrs weston\\nthis is the simple truth\\n\\nmrs weston kissed her with tears of joy and when she could\\nfind utterance assured her that this protestation had done\\nher more good than any thing else in the world could do\\n\\nmr weston will be almost as much relieved as myself said she\\non this point we have been wretched  it was our darling wish that you\\nmight be attached to each otherand we were persuaded that it was so\\nimagine what we have been feeling on your account\\n\\ni have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of\\ngrateful wonder to you and myself  but this does not acquit him\\nmrs weston and i must say that i think him greatly to blame\\nwhat right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged\\nand with manners so very disengaged  what right had he to endeavour\\nto please as he certainly didto distinguish any one young woman with\\npersevering attention as he certainly didwhile he really belonged\\nto anotherhow could he tell what mischief he might be doing\\nhow could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him\\nvery wrong very wrong indeed\\n\\nfrom something that he said my dear emma i rather imagine\\n\\nand how could she bear such behaviour  composure with a witness\\nto look on while repeated attentions were offering to another woman\\nbefore her face and not resent itthat is a degree of placidity\\nwhich i can neither comprehend nor respect\\n\\nthere were misunderstandings between them emma he said\\nso expressly  he had not time to enter into much explanation\\nhe was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation\\nwhich did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay\\nbut that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said\\nthe present crisis indeed seemed to be brought on by them\\nand those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the\\nimpropriety of his conduct\\n\\nimpropriety  oh  mrs westonit is too calm a censure\\nmuch much beyond improprietyit has sunk him i cannot say how\\nit has sunk him in my opinion  so unlike what a man should be\\nnone of that upright integrity that strict adherence to truth\\nand principle that disdain of trick and littleness which a man\\nshould display in every transaction of his life\\n\\nnay dear emma now i must take his part for though he has been\\nwrong in this instance i have known him long enough to answer\\nfor his having many very many good qualities and\\n\\ngood god cried emma not attending to hermrs smallridge too\\njane actually on the point of going as governess  what could he\\nmean by such horrible indelicacy  to suffer her to engage herself\\nto suffer her even to think of such a measure\\n\\nhe knew nothing about it emma  on this article i can fully\\nacquit him  it was a private resolution of hers not communicated\\nto himor at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction\\ntill yesterday i know he said he was in the dark as to her plans\\nthey burst on him i do not know how but by some letter or message\\nand it was the discovery of what she was doing of this very project\\nof hers which determined him to come forward at once own it\\nall to his uncle throw himself on his kindness and in short\\nput an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been\\ncarrying on so long\\n\\nemma began to listen better\\n\\ni am to hear from him soon continued mrs weston  he told me\\nat parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which\\nseemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now\\nlet us wait therefore for this letter  it may bring many extenuations\\nit may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are\\nnot to be understood  dont let us be severe dont let us be in\\na hurry to condemn him  let us have patience  i must love him\\nand now that i am satisfied on one point the one material point\\ni am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well and ready\\nto hope that it may  they must both have suffered a great deal\\nunder such a system of secresy and concealment\\n\\nhis sufferings replied emma dryly do not appear to have done\\nhim much harm  well and how did mr churchill take it\\n\\nmost favourably for his nephewgave his consent with scarcely\\na difficulty  conceive what the events of a week have done\\nin that family  while poor mrs churchill lived i suppose there\\ncould not have been a hope a chance a possibilitybut scarcely\\nare her remains at rest in the family vault than her husband is\\npersuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required\\nwhat a blessing it is when undue influence does not survive the grave\\nhe gave his consent with very little persuasion\\n\\nah thought emma he would have done as much for harriet\\n\\nthis was settled last night and frank was off with the light\\nthis morning  he stopped at highbury at the batess i fancy\\nsome timeand then came on hither but was in such a hurry to get\\nback to his uncle to whom he is just now more necessary than ever\\nthat as i tell you he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour\\nhe was very much agitatedvery much indeedto a degree that made\\nhim appear quite a different creature from any thing i had ever seen\\nhim beforein addition to all the rest there had been the shock of\\nfinding her so very unwell which he had had no previous suspicion of\\nand there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal\\n\\nand do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on\\nwith such perfect secresythe campbells the dixons did none\\nof them know of the engagement\\n\\nemma could not speak the name of dixon without a little blush\\n\\nnone not one  he positively said that it had been known to no\\nbeing in the world but their two selves\\n\\nwell said emma i suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled\\nto the idea and i wish them very happy  but i shall always\\nthink it a very abominable sort of proceeding  what has it been\\nbut a system of hypocrisy and deceitespionage and treachery\\nto come among us with professions of openness and simplicity\\nand such a league in secret to judge us allhere have we been\\nthe whole winter and spring completely duped fancying ourselves\\nall on an equal footing of truth and honour with two people in the\\nmidst of us who may have been carrying round comparing and sitting\\nin judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both\\nto hearthey must take the consequence if they have heard each\\nother spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable\\n\\ni am quite easy on that head replied mrs weston  i am\\nvery sure that i never said any thing of either to the other\\nwhich both might not have heard\\n\\nyou are in luckyour only blunder was confined to my ear\\nwhen you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady\\n\\ntrue  but as i have always had a thoroughly good opinion of miss\\nfairfax i never could under any blunder have spoken ill of her\\nand as to speaking ill of him there i must have been safe\\n\\nat this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance from the window\\nevidently on the watch  his wife gave him a look which invited\\nhim in and while he was coming round added now dearest emma\\nlet me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his\\nheart at ease and incline him to be satisfied with the match\\nlet us make the best of itand indeed almost every thing may\\nbe fairly said in her favour  it is not a connexion to gratify\\nbut if mr churchill does not feel that why should we and it\\nmay be a very fortunate circumstance for him for frank i mean\\nthat he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness\\nof character and good judgment as i have always given her credit for\\nand still am disposed to give her credit for in spite of this\\none great deviation from the strict rule of right  and how much\\nmay be said in her situation for even that error\\n\\nmuch indeed cried emma feelingly  if a woman can ever\\nbe excused for thinking only of herself it is in a situation\\nlike jane fairfaxsof such one may almost say that the\\nworld is not theirs nor the worlds law\\n\\nshe met mr weston on his entrance with a smiling countenance\\nexclaiming\\n\\na very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word\\nthis was a device i suppose to sport with my curiosity\\nand exercise my talent of guessing  but you really frightened me\\ni thought you had lost half your property at least  and here\\ninstead of its being a matter of condolence it turns out to be one\\nof congratulationi congratulate you mr weston with all my heart\\non the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished\\nyoung women in england for your daughter\\n\\na glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was\\nas right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits\\nwas immediate  his air and voice recovered their usual briskness\\nhe shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand and entered\\non the subject in a manner to prove that he now only wanted\\ntime and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing\\nhis companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence\\nor smooth objections and by the time they had talked it all\\nover together and he had talked it all over again with emma\\nin their walk back to hartfield he was become perfectly reconciled\\nand not far from thinking it the very best thing that frank could\\npossibly have done\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xi\\n\\n\\nharriet poor harrietthose were the words in them lay the\\ntormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted\\nthe real misery of the business to her  frank churchill had behaved\\nvery ill by herselfvery ill in many waysbut it was not so much\\nhis behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him\\nit was the scrape which he had drawn her into on harriets account\\nthat gave the deepest hue to his offencepoor harriet to be a second\\ntime the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery  mr knightley\\nhad spoken prophetically when he once said emma you have been\\nno friend to harriet smithshe was afraid she had done her nothing\\nbut disserviceit was true that she had not to charge herself\\nin this instance as in the former with being the sole and original\\nauthor of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might\\notherwise never have entered harriets imagination for harriet\\nhad acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill\\nbefore she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt\\ncompletely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed\\nshe might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments\\nher influence would have been enough  and now she was very conscious\\nthat she ought to have prevented themshe felt that she had been\\nrisking her friends happiness on most insufficient grounds\\ncommon sense would have directed her to tell harriet that she\\nmust not allow herself to think of him and that there were five\\nhundred chances to one against his ever caring for herbut with\\ncommon sense she added i am afraid i have had little to do\\n\\nshe was extremely angry with herself  if she could not have been\\nangry with frank churchill too it would have been dreadful\\nas for jane fairfax she might at least relieve her feelings\\nfrom any present solicitude on her account  harriet would\\nbe anxiety enough she need no longer be unhappy about jane\\nwhose troubles and whose illhealth having of course the same origin\\nmust be equally under cureher days of insignificance and evil\\nwere overshe would soon be well and happy and prosperous\\nemma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted\\nthis discovery laid many smaller matters open  no doubt it had been\\nfrom jealousyin janes eyes she had been a rival and well might\\nany thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed\\nan airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack\\nand arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison\\nshe understood it all and as far as her mind could disengage itself\\nfrom the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings she acknowledged\\nthat jane fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond\\nher desert  but poor harriet was such an engrossing charge\\nthere was little sympathy to be spared for any body else\\nemma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be\\nmore severe than the first  considering the very superior claims\\nof the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect\\non harriets mind producing reserve and selfcommand it would\\nshe must communicate the painful truth however and as soon\\nas possible  an injunction of secresy had been among mr westons\\nparting words  for the present the whole affair was to be\\ncompletely a secret  mr churchill had made a point of it\\nas a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost\\nand every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum\\nemma had promised but still harriet must be excepted  it was her\\nsuperior duty\\n\\nin spite of her vexation she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous\\nthat she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to\\nperform by harriet which mrs weston had just gone through by herself\\nthe intelligence which had been so anxiously announced to her\\nshe was now to be anxiously announcing to another  her heart beat\\nquick on hearing harriets footstep and voice so she supposed\\nhad poor mrs weston felt when she was approaching randalls\\ncould the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance\\nbut of that unfortunately there could be no chance\\n\\nwell miss woodhouse cried harriet coming eagerly into the room\\nis not this the oddest news that ever was\\n\\nwhat news do you mean replied emma unable to guess by look\\nor voice whether harriet could indeed have received any hint\\n\\nabout jane fairfax  did you ever hear any thing so strange\\nohyou need not be afraid of owning it to me for mr weston has\\ntold me himself  i met him just now  he told me it was to be\\na great secret and therefore i should not think of mentioning\\nit to any body but you but he said you knew it\\n\\nwhat did mr weston tell yousaid emma still perplexed\\n\\noh he told me all about it that jane fairfax and mr frank\\nchurchill are to be married and that they have been privately\\nengaged to one another this long while  how very odd\\n\\nit was indeed so odd harriets behaviour was so extremely odd\\nthat emma did not know how to understand it  her character appeared\\nabsolutely changed  she seemed to propose shewing no agitation\\nor disappointment or peculiar concern in the discovery  emma looked\\nat her quite unable to speak\\n\\nhad you any idea cried harriet of his being in love\\nwith heryou perhaps mightyou blushing as she spoke\\nwho can see into every bodys heart but nobody else\\n\\nupon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent\\ncan you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached\\nto another woman at the very time that i wastacitly if not openly\\nencouraging you to give way to your own feelingsi never had\\nthe slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank\\nchurchills having the least regard for jane fairfax  you may be\\nvery sure that if i had i should have cautioned you accordingly\\n\\nme cried harriet colouring and astonished  why should you\\ncaution meyou do not think i care about mr frank churchill\\n\\ni am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject\\nreplied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there\\nwas a timeand not very distant eitherwhen you gave me reason\\nto understand that you did care about him\\n\\nhimnever never  dear miss woodhouse how could you so mistake me\\nturning away distressed\\n\\nharriet cried emma after a moments pausewhat do you mean\\ngood heaven what do you meanmistake youam i to suppose then\\n\\nshe could not speak another wordher voice was lost and she\\nsat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer\\n\\nharriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned\\nfrom her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak\\nit was in a voice nearly as agitated as emmas\\n\\ni should not have thought it possible she began that you\\ncould have misunderstood me  i know we agreed never to name him\\nbut considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else\\ni should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed\\nto mean any other person  mr frank churchill indeed  i do not\\nknow who would ever look at him in the company of the other\\ni hope i have a better taste than to think of mr frank churchill\\nwho is like nobody by his side  and that you should have been\\nso mistaken is amazingi am sure but for believing that you\\nentirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment\\ni should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost\\nto dare to think of him  at first if you had not told me\\nthat more wonderful things had happened that there had been\\nmatches of greater disparity those were your very words\\ni should not have dared to give way toi should not have thought\\nit possiblebut if you who had been always acquainted with him\\n\\nharriet cried emma collecting herself resolutelylet us\\nunderstand each other now without the possibility of farther mistake\\nare you speaking ofmr knightley\\n\\nto be sure i am  i never could have an idea of any body else\\nand so i thought you knew  when we talked about him it was as clear\\nas possible\\n\\nnot quite returned emma with forced calmness for all that\\nyou then said appeared to me to relate to a different person\\ni could almost assert that you had named mr frank churchill\\ni am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you\\nin protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of\\n\\noh  miss woodhouse how you do forget\\n\\nmy dear harriet i perfectly remember the substance of what i\\nsaid on the occasion  i told you that i did not wonder at\\nyour attachment that considering the service he had rendered you\\nit was extremely naturaland you agreed to it expressing yourself\\nvery warmly as to your sense of that service and mentioning\\neven what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward\\nto your rescuethe impression of it is strong on my memory\\n\\noh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i\\nwas thinking of something very different at the time  it was not\\nthe gipsiesit was not mr frank churchill that i meant  no with\\nsome elevation i was thinking of a much more precious circumstance\\nof mr knightleys coming and asking me to dance when mr elton\\nwould not stand up with me and when there was no other partner in\\nthe room  that was the kind action that was the noble benevolence\\nand generosity that was the service which made me begin to feel\\nhow superior he was to every other being upon earth\\n\\ngood god cried emma this has been a most unfortunate\\nmost deplorable mistakewhat is to be done\\n\\nyou would not have encouraged me then if you had understood me\\nat least however i cannot be worse off than i should have been\\nif the other had been the person and nowit is possible\\n\\nshe paused a few moments  emma could not speak\\n\\ni do not wonder miss woodhouse she resumed that you should feel\\na great difference between the two as to me or as to any body\\nyou must think one five hundred million times more above me than\\nthe other  but i hope miss woodhouse that supposingthat if\\nstrange as it may appear  but you know they were your own words\\nthat more wonderful things had happened matches of greater disparity\\nhad taken place than between mr frank churchill and me and therefore\\nit seems as if such a thing even as this may have occurred before\\nand if i should be so fortunate beyond expression as to\\nif mr knightley should reallyif he does not mind the disparity\\ni hope dear miss woodhouse you will not set yourself against it\\nand try to put difficulties in the way  but you are too good for that\\ni am sure\\n\\nharriet was standing at one of the windows  emma turned round\\nto look at her in consternation and hastily said\\n\\nhave you any idea of mr knightleys returning your affection\\n\\nyes replied harriet modestly but not fearfullyi must say\\nthat i have\\n\\nemmas eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating\\nin a fixed attitude for a few minutes  a few minutes were sufficient\\nfor making her acquainted with her own heart  a mind like hers\\nonce opening to suspicion made rapid progress  she touched\\nshe admittedshe acknowledged the whole truth  why was it\\nso much worse that harriet should be in love with mr knightley\\nthan with frank churchill  why was the evil so dreadfully increased\\nby harriets having some hope of a return  it darted through her\\nwith the speed of an arrow that mr knightley must marry no one\\nbut herself\\n\\nher own conduct as well as her own heart was before her in the\\nsame few minutes  she saw it all with a clearness which had\\nnever blessed her before  how improperly had she been acting\\nby harriet  how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational\\nhow unfeeling had been her conduct  what blindness what madness\\nhad led her on  it struck her with dreadful force and she\\nwas ready to give it every bad name in the world  some portion\\nof respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits\\nsome concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice\\nby harrietthere would be no need of compassion to the girl\\nwho believed herself loved by mr knightleybut justice required\\nthat she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now\\ngave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness\\nwith even apparent kindnessfor her own advantage indeed it was fit\\nthat the utmost extent of harriets hopes should be enquired into\\nand harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest\\nwhich had been so voluntarily formed and maintainedor to deserve\\nto be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right\\nrousing from reflection therefore and subduing her emotion\\nshe turned to harriet again and in a more inviting accent renewed\\nthe conversation for as to the subject which had first introduced it\\nthe wonderful story of jane fairfax that was quite sunk and lost\\nneither of them thought but of mr knightley and themselves\\n\\nharriet who had been standing in no unhappy reverie was yet very glad\\nto be called from it by the now encouraging manner of such a judge\\nand such a friend as miss woodhouse and only wanted invitation\\nto give the history of her hopes with great though trembling\\ndelightemmas tremblings as she asked and as she listened\\nwere better concealed than harriets but they were not less\\nher voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation\\nthat such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil\\nsuch a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create\\nshe listened with much inward suffering but with great outward\\npatience to harriets detailmethodical or well arranged\\nor very well delivered it could not be expected to be\\nbut it contained when separated from all the feebleness and\\ntautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit\\nespecially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory\\nbrought in favour of mr knightleys most improved opinion of harriet\\n\\nharriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\\nthose two decisive dancesemma knew that he had on that occasion\\nfound her much superior to his expectation  from that evening\\nor at least from the time of miss woodhouses encouraging her\\nto think of him harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking\\nto her much more than he had been used to do and of his having\\nindeed quite a different manner towards her a manner of kindness\\nand sweetnesslatterly she had been more and more aware of it\\nwhen they had been all walking together he had so often come and walked\\nby her and talked so very delightfullyhe seemed to want to be\\nacquainted with her  emma knew it to have been very much the case\\nshe had often observed the change to almost the same extent\\nharriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him\\nand emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had\\nknown of his opinion of harriet  he praised her for being without\\nart or affectation for having simple honest generous feelings\\nshe knew that he saw such recommendations in harriet he had dwelt\\non them to her more than oncemuch that lived in harriets memory\\nmany little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look\\na speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied\\na preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected\\nby emma  circumstances that might swell to half an hours relation\\nand contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed\\nundiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences\\nto be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not\\nwithout some degree of witness from emma herselfthe first\\nwas his walking with her apart from the others in the limewalk\\nat donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came\\nand he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from\\nthe rest to himselfand at first he had talked to her in a more\\nparticular way than he had ever done before in a very particular\\nway indeedharriet could not recall it without a blush he seemed\\nto be almost asking her whether her affections were engaged\\nbut as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them\\nhe changed the subject and began talking about farming\\nthe second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour\\nbefore emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his\\nbeing at hartfieldthough when he first came in he had said\\nthat he could not stay five minutesand his having told her\\nduring their conversation that though he must go to london\\nit was very much against his inclination that he left home at all\\nwhich was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to her\\nthe superior degree of confidence towards harriet which this one\\narticle marked gave her severe pain\\n\\non the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did\\nafter a little reflection venture the following question\\nmight he notis not it possible that when enquiring as you thought\\ninto the state of your affections he might be alluding to mr martin\\nhe might have mr martins interest in view  but harriet rejected\\nthe suspicion with spirit\\n\\nmr martin  no indeedthere was not a hint of mr martin\\ni hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be\\nsuspected of it\\n\\nwhen harriet had closed her evidence she appealed to her dear\\nmiss woodhouse to say whether she had not good ground for hope\\n\\ni never should have presumed to think of it at first said she\\nbut for you  you told me to observe him carefully and let\\nhis behaviour be the rule of mineand so i have  but now i seem\\nto feel that i may deserve him and that if he does chuse me\\nit will not be any thing so very wonderful\\n\\nthe bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter\\nfeelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emmas side\\nto enable her to say on reply\\n\\nharriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is\\nthe last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman\\nthe idea of his feeling for her more than he really does\\n\\nharriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory\\nand emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at\\nthat moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her\\nfathers footsteps  he was coming through the hall  harriet was\\ntoo much agitated to encounter him  she could not compose herself\\nmr woodhouse would be alarmedshe had better gowith most ready\\nencouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through\\nanother doorand the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous\\nburst of emmas feelings  oh god that i had never seen her\\n\\nthe rest of the day the following night were hardly enough\\nfor her thoughtsshe was bewildered amidst the confusion\\nof all that had rushed on her within the last few hours\\nevery moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize\\nmust be matter of humiliation to herhow to understand it all\\nhow to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising\\non herself and living underthe blunders the blindness of her\\nown head and heartshe sat still she walked about she tried her\\nown room she tried the shrubberyin every place every posture\\nshe perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed\\non by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing\\non herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched\\nand should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness\\n\\nto understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the\\nfirst endeavour  to that point went every leisure moment which her\\nfathers claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary\\nabsence of mind\\n\\nhow long had mr knightley been so dear to her as every feeling\\ndeclared him now to be  when had his influence such influence begun\\nwhen had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank\\nchurchill had once for a short period occupiedshe looked back\\nshe compared the twocompared them as they had always stood in\\nher estimation from the time of the latters becoming known to her\\nand as they must at any time have been compared by her had it\\noh had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute\\nthe comparisonshe saw that there never had been a time when she\\ndid not consider mr knightley as infinitely the superior or when\\nhis regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear  she saw\\nthat in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary\\nshe had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her\\nown heartand in short that she had never really cared for frank\\nchurchill at all\\n\\nthis was the conclusion of the first series of reflection\\nthis was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry\\nwhich she reached and without being long in reaching it\\nshe was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation\\nbut the one revealed to herher affection for mr knightley\\nevery other part of her mind was disgusting\\n\\nwith insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every\\nbodys feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every\\nbodys destiny  she was proved to have been universally mistaken\\nand she had not quite done nothingfor she had done mischief\\nshe had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared\\non mr knightleywere this most unequal of all connexions to\\ntake place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it\\na beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only\\nby a consciousness of harrietsand even were this not the case\\nhe would never have known harriet at all but for her folly\\n\\nmr knightley and harriet smithit was a union to distance every\\nwonder of the kindthe attachment of frank churchill

an\\nelevation on her side  such a debasement on his  it was horrible\\nto emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion\\nto foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt

known\\nhow much of her happiness depended on being first with mr knightley\\nfirst in interest and affectionsatisfied that it was so\\nand feeling it her due she had enjoyed it without reflection\\nand only in the dread of being supplanted found how inexpressibly\\nimportant it had beenlong very long she felt she had been first\\nfor having no female connexions of his own there had been\\nonly isabella whose claims could be compared with hers and she\\nhad always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed isabella\\nshe had herself been first with him for many years past\\nshe had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse\\nslighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of\\nhalf his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not\\nacknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her ownbut still\\nfrom family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind\\nhe had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour\\nto improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no\\nother creature had at all shared  in spite of all her faults\\nshe knew she was dear to him might she not say very dear\\nwhen the suggestions of hope however which must follow here\\npresented themselves she could not presume to indulge them\\nharriet smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly\\nexclusively passionately loved by mr knightley  she could not\\nshe could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment\\nto her  she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality\\nhow shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates  how directly\\nhow strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subjectnot too\\nstrongly for the offencebut far far too strongly to issue from\\nany feeling softer than upright justice and clearsighted goodwill\\nshe had no hope nothing to deserve the name of hope that he could\\nhave that sort of affection for herself which was now in question\\nbut there was a hope at times a slight one at times much stronger\\nthat harriet might have deceived herself and be overrating his\\nregard for herwish it she must for his sakebe the

might at\\nleast be able to ascertain what the chances for it wereshe should\\nsee them henceforward with the closest observance and wretchedly\\nas she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching\\nshe did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here\\nhe was expected back every day  the power of observation would be\\nsoon givenfrightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in\\none course  in the meanwhile she resolved against seeing harriet\\nit would do neither of them good it would do the subject no good\\nto be talking of it farthershe was resolved not to be convinced\\nas long as she could doubt and yet had no authority for opposing\\nharriets confidence  to talk would be only to irritateshe wrote\\nto her therefore kindly but decisively to beg that she would not\\nat present come to hartfield acknowledging it to be her conviction\\nthat all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better\\nbe avoided and hoping that if a few days were allowed to pass before\\nthey met again except in the company of othersshe objected only\\nto a teteatetethey might be able to act as if they had forgotten\\nthe conversation of yesterdayharriet submitted and approved\\nand was grateful\\n\\nthis point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emmas\\nthoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them\\nsleeping or waking the last twentyfour hoursmrs weston who had\\nbeen calling on her daughterinlaw elect and took hartfield in her\\nway home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself\\nto relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview\\n\\nmr weston had accompanied her to mrs batess and gone through his\\nshare of this essential attention most handsomely but she having\\nthen induced miss fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned\\nwith much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction\\nthan a quarter of an hour spent in mrs batess parlour with all\\nthe encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded\\n\\na little curiosity emma had and she made the most of it while\\nher friend related  mrs weston had set off to pay the visit\\nin a good deal of agitation herself and in the first place had\\nwished not to go at all at present to be allowed merely to write\\nto miss fairfax instead and to defer this ceremonious call till\\na little time had passed and mr churchill could be reconciled\\nto the engagements becoming known as considering every thing\\nshe thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports\\nbut mr weston had thought differently he was extremely anxious\\nto shew his approbation to miss fairfax and her family and did not\\nconceive that any suspicion could be excited by it or if it were\\nthat it would be of any consequence for such things he observed\\nalways got about  emma smiled and felt that mr weston had\\nvery good reason for saying so  they had gone in shortand very\\ngreat had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady\\nshe had hardly been able to speak a word and every look and action\\nhad shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness  the quiet\\nheartfelt satisfaction of the old lady and the rapturous delight\\nof her daughterwho proved even too joyous to talk as usual\\nhad been a gratifying yet almost an affecting scene  they were\\nboth so truly respectable in their happiness so disinterested\\nin every sensation thought so much of jane so much of every body\\nand so little of themselves that every kindly feeling was at work\\nfor them  miss fairfaxs recent illness had offered a fair plea\\nfor mrs weston to invite her to an airing she had drawn back and\\ndeclined at first but on being pressed had yielded and in the\\ncourse of their drive mrs weston had by gentle encouragement\\novercome so much of her embarrassment as to bring her to converse\\non the important subject  apologies for her seemingly ungracious\\nsilence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the\\ngratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr weston\\nmust necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by\\nthey had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state\\nof the engagement  mrs weston was convinced that such conversation\\nmust be the greatest relief to her companion pent up within her own\\nmind as every thing had so long been and was very much pleased\\nwith all that she had said on the subject\\n\\non the misery of what she had suffered during the concealment\\nof so many months continued mrs weston she was energetic\\nthis was one of her expressions  i will not say that since i\\nentered into the engagement i have not had some happy moments but i\\ncan say that i have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour\\nand the quivering lip emma which uttered it was an attestation\\nthat i felt at my heart\\n\\npoor girl said emma  she thinks herself wrong then for having\\nconsented to a private engagement\\n\\nwrong  no one i believe can blame her more than she is disposed\\nto blame herself  the consequence said she has been a state\\nof perpetual suffering to me and so it ought  but after all the\\npunishment that misconduct can bring it is still not less misconduct\\npain is no expiation  i never can be blameless  i have been acting\\ncontrary to all my sense of right and the fortunate turn that every\\nthing has taken and the kindness i am now receiving is what my\\nconscience tells me ought not to be  do not imagine madam\\nshe continued that i was taught wrong  do not let any reflection\\nfall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought\\nme up  the error has been all my own and i do assure you that\\nwith all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give\\ni shall yet dread making the story known to colonel campbell\\n\\npoor girl said emma again  she loves him then excessively\\ni suppose  it must have been from attachment only that she could\\nbe led to form the engagement  her affection must have overpowered\\nher judgment\\n\\nyes i have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him\\n\\ni am afraid returned emma sighing that i must often have\\ncontributed to make her unhappy\\n\\non your side my love it was very innocently done  but she\\nprobably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding\\nto the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before\\none natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in\\nshe said was that of making her unreasonable  the consciousness\\nof having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes\\nand made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been\\nthat had beenhard for him to bear  i did not make the allowances\\nsaid she which i ought to have done for his temper and spirits\\nhis delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness\\nof disposition which under any other circumstances would i am sure\\nhave been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first\\nshe then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you\\nhad shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me\\nhow it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity\\nto thank youi could not thank you too muchfor every wish and\\nevery endeavour to do her good  she was sensible that you had never\\nreceived any proper acknowledgment from herself\\n\\nif i did not know her to be happy now said emma seriously\\nwhich in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous\\nconscience she must be i could not bear these thanksfor oh\\nmrs weston if there were an account drawn up of the evil\\nand the good i have done miss fairfaxwell checking herself\\nand trying to be more lively this is all to be forgotten\\nyou are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars\\nthey shew her to the greatest advantage  i am sure she is very good\\ni hope she will be very happy  it is fit that the fortune\\nshould be on his side for i think the merit will be all on hers\\n\\nsuch a conclusion could not pass unanswered by mrs weston\\nshe thought well of frank in almost every respect and what was more\\nshe loved him very much and her defence was therefore earnest\\nshe talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection\\nbut she had too much to urge for emmas attention it was soon gone\\nto brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen\\nand when mrs weston ended with we have not yet had the letter\\nwe are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come\\nshe was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged\\nto answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it\\nwas which they were so anxious for\\n\\nare you well my emma was mrs westons parting question\\n\\noh perfectly  i am always well you know  be sure to give me\\nintelligence of the letter as soon as possible\\n\\nmrs westons communications furnished emma with more food for\\nunpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion\\nand her sense of past injustice towards miss fairfax  she bitterly\\nregretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed\\nfor the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure\\nthe cause  had she followed mr knightleys known wishes in paying\\nthat attention to miss fairfax which was every way her due had she\\ntried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy\\nhad she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in harriet smith\\nshe must in all probability have been spared from every pain\\nwhich pressed on her nowbirth abilities and education\\nhad been equally marking one as an associate for her to be received\\nwith gratitude and the otherwhat was shesupposing even that\\nthey had never become intimate friends that she had never been\\nadmitted into miss fairfaxs confidence on this important matter\\nwhich was most probablestill in knowing her as she ought\\nand as she might she must have been preserved from the abominable\\nsuspicions of an improper attachment to mr dixon which she had\\nnot only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself but had so\\nunpardonably imparted an idea which she greatly feared had been made\\na subject of material distress to the delicacy of janes feelings\\nby the levity or carelessness of frank churchills  of all the sources\\nof evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury\\nshe was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst\\nshe must have been a perpetual enemy  they never could have been\\nall three together without her having stabbed jane fairfaxs peace\\nin a thousand instances and on box hill perhaps it had been\\nthe agony of a mind that would bear no more\\n\\nthe evening of this day was very long and melancholy at hartfield\\nthe weather added what it could of gloom  a cold stormy rain set in\\nand nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the\\nwind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made\\nsuch cruel sights the longer visible\\n\\nthe weather affected mr woodhouse and he could only be kept tolerably\\ncomfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughters side\\nand by exertions which had never cost her half so much before\\nit reminded her of their first forlorn teteatete on the evening\\nof mrs westons weddingday but mr knightley had walked\\nin then soon after tea and dissipated every melancholy fancy\\nalas such delightful proofs of hartfields attraction as those\\nsort of visits conveyed might shortly be over  the picture which\\nshe had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter\\nhad proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures\\nhad been lostbut her present forebodings she feared would\\nexperience no similar contradiction  the prospect before her now\\nwas threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled\\nthat might not be even partially brightened  if all took place\\nthat might take place among the circle of her friends hartfield must\\nbe comparatively deserted and she left to cheer her father with the\\nspirits only of ruined happiness\\n\\nthe child to be born at randalls must be a tie there even dearer\\nthan herself and mrs westons heart and time would be occupied\\nby it  they should lose her and probably in great measure\\nher husband alsofrank churchill would return among them no more\\nand miss fairfax it was reasonable to suppose would soon cease\\nto belong to highbury  they would be married and settled either\\nat or near enscombe  all that were good would be withdrawn and if\\nto these losses the loss of donwell were to be added what would\\nremain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach\\nmr knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort\\nno longer walking in at all hours as if ever willing to change\\nhis own home for theirshow was it to

had been all her own work\\n\\nwhen it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain\\nfrom a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room\\nfor a few secondsand the only source whence any thing like consolation\\nor composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own\\nbetter conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and\\ngaiety might be the

meant to walk with her\\nshe found  he had just looked into the diningroom and as he\\nwas not wanted there preferred being out of doorsshe thought\\nhe neither looked nor spoke cheerfully and the first possible\\ncause for it suggested by her fears was that he had perhaps been\\ncommunicating his plans to his brother and was pained by the manner\\nin which they had been received\\n\\nthey walked together  he was silent  she thought he was often\\nlooking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it\\nsuited her to give  and this belief produced another dread\\nperhaps he wanted to speak to her of his attachment to harriet\\nhe might be watching for encouragement to beginshe did not\\ncould not feel equal to lead the way to any such subject\\nhe must do it all himself

consideration replied\\n\\nyou are very kindbut you are mistakenand i must set you right\\ni am not in want of that sort of compassion  my blindness to what\\nwas going on led me to act by them in a

am in a very extraordinary situation  i cannot let you continue in\\nyour error and yet perhaps since my manners gave such an impression\\ni have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that i never have\\nbeen at all attached to the person we are speaking of as it might\\nbe natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse\\nbut i never have\\n\\nhe listened in perfect silence

enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house\\nor even the attentive daughter\\n\\npoor mr woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him\\nin the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so\\nanxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ridecould he\\nhave seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs\\nbut without the most

continued\\nbut when he was gone she began to be a little tranquillised\\nand subduedand in the course of the sleepless night which was\\nthe tax for such an evening she found one or two such very serious\\npoints to consider as made her feel that even her happiness\\nmust have some alloy  her fatherand harriet  she could not be\\nalone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims\\nand how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost was the question\\nwith respect to her father it was a question soon answered\\nshe hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short\\nparley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution\\nof never quitting her fathershe even wept over the idea of it\\nas a sin of thought  while he lived it must be only an engagement\\nbut she flattered herself that if divested of the danger of\\ndrawing her away it might become an increase of comfort to him\\nhow to do her best by harriet was of more difficult decision\\nhow to spare her from any unnecessary pain how to make\\nher any possible atonement how to appear least her enemy\\non these subjects her perplexity and distress were very great\\nand her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter\\nreproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it\\nshe could only resolve at last that she would still avoid a\\nmeeting with her and communicate all that need be told by letter\\nthat it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just\\nnow for a time from highbury andindulging in one scheme more\\nnearly resolve that it might be practicable to get an invitation\\nfor her to brunswick squareisabella had been pleased with harriet\\nand a few weeks spent in london must give her some amusement\\nshe did not think it in

thing was due a separation for the present an averting\\nof the evil day when they must all be together again\\n\\nshe rose early and wrote her letter to harriet an employment\\nwhich left her so very serious so nearly sad that mr knightley\\nin walking up to hartfield to breakfast did not arrive at all too soon\\nand half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again\\nwith him literally and figuratively was quite necessary to reinstate\\nher in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before\\n\\nhe had not left her long by no means long enough for her to have\\nthe slightest inclination for thinking of any body else when a letter\\nwas brought her from randallsa very thick lettershe guessed\\nwhat it must contain and deprecated the necessity of reading it\\nshe

point\\nand now i come to the principal the only important part of my\\nconduct while belonging to you which excites my own anxiety\\nor requires very solicitous explanation  with the greatest respect\\nand the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father\\nperhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation\\na few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion\\nand some censure i acknowledge myself liable tomy behaviour\\nto miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought\\nin order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led\\non to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy\\ninto which we were immediately throwni cannot deny that miss\\nwoodhouse was my ostensible objectbut i am sure you will believe\\nthe declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference\\ni would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on\\namiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me\\nthe idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was\\nperfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much\\nmy conviction as my wishshe received my attentions with an easy\\nfriendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me\\nwe seemed to understand each other  from our relative situation\\nthose attentions were her due and were felt to be sowhether miss\\nwoodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of\\nthat fortnight i cannot saywhen i called to take leave of her\\ni remember that i was within a moment of confessing the truth\\nand i then fancied she was not without suspicion but i have no\\ndoubt of her having since detected me at least in some degree\\nshe may not have surmised the whole but her quickness must\\nhave penetrated a part  i cannot doubt it  you will find\\nwhenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints\\nthat it did not take her wholly by surprize  she frequently gave\\nme hints of it  i remember her telling me at the ball that i\\nowed mrs elton gratitude for her attentions to miss fairfax\\ni hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted\\nby you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss\\nwhile you considered me as having sinned against emma woodhouse\\ni could deserve nothing from either  acquit me here and procure\\nfor me when it is allowable the acquittal and good wishes of that\\nsaid emma woodhouse whom i regard with so much brotherly affection\\nas to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself\\nwhatever strange things i said or did during that fortnight you have\\nnow a key to  my heart was in highbury and my business was to get\\nmy body thither as often as might be and with the least suspicion\\nif you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account\\nof the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say\\nthat its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would\\nnever have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her\\nthe delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement\\nmy dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to\\nyou will soon i earnestly hope know her thoroughly yourself\\nno description can describe her  she must tell you herself what she is\\nyet not by word for never was there a human creature who would\\nso

impatient for a thousand particulars  remember how few\\nminutes i was at randalls and in how bewildered how mad a state\\nand i am not much better yet still insane either from happiness\\nor misery  when i think of the kindness and favour i have met with\\nof her excellence and patience and my uncles generosity i am mad\\nwith joy  but when i recollect all the uneasiness i occasioned her\\nand how little i deserve to be forgiven i am mad with anger\\nif i could but see her againbut i must not propose it yet\\nmy uncle has been too good for me to encroachi must still add\\nto this long letter  you have not heard all that you ought to hear\\ni could not give any connected detail yesterday but the suddenness\\nand in one light the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out\\nneeds explanation for though the event of the 26th ult as you\\nwill conclude immediately opened to me the happiest prospects\\ni should not have presumed on such early measures but from the\\nvery particular circumstances which left me not an hour to lose\\ni should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty and she would have\\nfelt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement\\nbut i had no choice  the hasty engagement she had entered into with\\nthat womanhere my dear madam i was obliged to leave off abruptly\\nto recollect and compose myselfi have been walking over the country\\nand am now i hope rational enough to make the rest of my letter\\nwhat it ought to beit is in fact a most mortifying retrospect\\nfor me  i behaved shamefully  and here i can admit that my manners\\nto miss w in being unpleasant to miss f were highly blameable\\nshe disapproved them which ought to have been enoughmy plea of\\nconcealing the truth she did not think sufficientshe was displeased\\ni thought unreasonably so  i thought her on a thousand occasions\\nunnecessarily scrupulous and cautious  i thought her even cold\\nbut she was always right  if i had followed her judgment and subdued\\nmy spirits to the level of what she deemed proper i should have\\nescaped the greatest unhappiness i have ever knownwe quarrelled\\ndo you remember the morning spent at donwellthere every little\\ndissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis  i was late\\ni met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her\\nbut she would not suffer it  she absolutely refused to allow me\\nwhich i then thought most unreasonable  now however i see nothing\\nin it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion\\nwhile i to blind the world to our engagement was behaving one\\nhour with objectionable particularity to another woman was she\\nto be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made\\nevery previous caution uselesshad we been met walking together\\nbetween donwell and highbury the truth must have been suspected\\ni was mad enough however to resenti doubted her affection\\ni doubted it more the next day on box hill when provoked by\\nsuch conduct on my side such shameful insolent neglect of her\\nand such apparent devotion to miss w as it would have been\\nimpossible for any woman of sense to endure she spoke her\\nresentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me\\nin short my dear madam it was a quarrel blameless on her side\\nabominable on mine and i returned the same evening to richmond\\nthough i might have staid with you till the next morning\\nmerely because i would be as angry with her as possible  even then\\ni was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time\\nbut i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went\\naway determined that she should make the first advancesi shall\\nalways congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party\\nhad you witnessed my behaviour there i can hardly suppose you would\\never have thought well of me again  its effect upon her appears\\nin the immediate resolution it produced  as soon as she found i\\nwas really gone from randalls she closed with the offer of that\\nofficious mrs elton the whole system of whose treatment of her\\nby the bye has ever filled me with indignation and hatred\\ni must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been\\nso richly extended towards myself but otherwise i should loudly\\nprotest against the share of it which that woman has known\\njane indeedyou will observe that i have not yet indulged myself\\nin calling her by that name even to you  think then what i must\\nhave endured in hearing it bandied between the eltons with all\\nthe vulgarity of needless repetition and all the insolence of\\nimaginary superiority  have patience with me i shall soon have done\\nshe closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely\\nand wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again\\nshe felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery\\nto each  she dissolved itthis letter reached me on the very\\nmorning of my poor aunts death  i answered it within an hour\\nbut from the confusion of my mind and the multiplicity of business\\nfalling on me at once my answer instead of being sent with all\\nthe many other letters of that day was locked up in my writingdesk\\nand i trusting that i had written enough though but a few lines\\nto satisfy her remained without any uneasinessi was rather\\ndisappointed that i did not hear from her again speedily\\nbut i made excuses for her and was too busy andmay i add\\ntoo cheerful in my views to be captiouswe removed to windsor\\nand two days afterwards i received a parcel from her my own letters\\nall returnedand a few lines at the same time by the post\\nstating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply\\nto her last and adding that as silence on such a point could\\nnot be misconstrued and as it must be equally desirable to both\\nto have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible\\nshe now sent me by a safe conveyance all my letters and requested\\nthat if i could not directly command hers so as to send them\\nto highbury within a week i would forward them after that period\\nto her at  in

to emmas feelings  she was obliged\\nin spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do\\nit all the justice that mrs weston foretold  as soon as she\\ncame to her own name it was irresistible every line relating\\nto herself was interesting and almost every line agreeable\\nand when this charm ceased the subject could still maintain itself\\nby the natural return of her former regard for the writer and the\\nvery strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at\\nthat moment  she never stopt till she had gone through the whole\\nand though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong\\nyet he had been less wrong than she had supposedand he had suffered\\nand was very sorryand he was so grateful to mrs weston\\nand so much in love with miss fairfax and she was so happy herself\\nthat there was no being severe and could he have entered the room\\nshe must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever\\n\\nshe thought so well of the letter that when mr knightley came again\\nshe desired him to read it  she was sure of mrs westons wishing\\nit to be communicated especially to one who like mr knightley\\nhad seen so much to blame in his conduct\\n\\ni shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long\\ni will take it home with me at night\\n\\nbut that would not do  mr weston was to call in the evening\\nand she must return it by him\\n\\ni would rather be talking to you he replied but as it seems\\na matter of justice it shall be done\\n\\nhe beganstopping however almost directly to say had i been offered\\nthe sight of one of this gentlemans letters to his motherinlaw a few\\nmonths ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference\\n\\nhe proceeded a little farther reading to himself and then\\nwith a smile observed humph a fine complimentary opening\\nbut it is his way  one mans style must not be the rule of anothers\\nwe will not be severe\\n\\nit will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my\\nopinion aloud as i read  by doing it i shall feel that i am near you\\nit will not be so great a loss of time  but if you dislike it\\n\\nnot at all  i should wish it\\n\\nmr knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity\\n\\nhe trifles here said he as to the temptation  he knows\\nhe is wrong and has nothing rational to urgebadhe ought\\nnot to have formed the engagementhis fathers disposition\\nhe is unjust however to his father  mr westons sanguine\\ntemper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions\\nbut mr weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured\\nto gain itvery true he did not come till miss fairfax was here\\n\\nand i have not forgotten said emma how sure you were that he\\nmight have come sooner if he would  you pass it over very handsomely\\nbut you were perfectly right\\n\\ni was not quite impartial in my judgment emmabut yet i think\\nhad you not been in the casei should still have

sincere explanation of\\n\\nyou had better go on said she\\n\\nhe did so but very soon stopt again to say the pianoforte\\nah  that was the act of a very very young man one too young\\nto consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much\\nexceed the pleasure  a boyish scheme indeedi cannot\\ncomprehend a mans wishing to give a woman any proof of affection\\nwhich he knows she would rather dispense with and he did\\nknow that she would have prevented the instruments coming if she could\\n\\nafter this he made some progress without any pause\\nfrank churchills confession of having behaved shamefully\\nwas the first thing to call for more than a word in passing\\n\\ni perfectly agree with you sirwas then his remark\\nyou did behave very shamefully  you never wrote a truer line\\nand having gone through what immediately followed of the basis\\nof their disagreement and his persisting to act in direct\\nopposition to jane fairfaxs sense of right he made a fuller pause\\nto say this is very badhe had induced her to place herself\\nfor his sake in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness\\nand it should have been his first object to prevent her from\\nsuffering unnecessarilyshe must have had much more to contend with\\nin carrying on the correspondence than he could  he should have\\nrespected even unreasonable scruples had there been such but hers\\nwere all reasonable  we must look to her one fault and remember\\nthat she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement\\nto bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment\\n\\nemma knew that he was now getting to the box hill party\\nand grew uncomfortable  her own behaviour had been so very improper\\nshe was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next

i\\nleft you this morning emma my mind has been hard at work on\\none subject\\n\\nthe subject followed it was in plain unaffected gentlemanlike english\\nsuch as mr knightley used even to the woman he was in love with\\nhow to be able to ask her to marry him without attacking the\\nhappiness of her father  emmas answer was ready at the first word\\nwhile her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible\\nfor her  she could never quit him  part only of this answer\\nhowever was admitted  the impossibility of her quitting her father\\nmr knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility\\nof any other change he could not agree to  he had been thinking\\nit over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce\\nmr woodhouse to remove with her to donwell he had wanted to believe\\nit feasible but his knowledge of mr woodhouse would not suffer\\nhim to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion\\nthat such a transplantation would be a risk of her fathers comfort\\nperhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded  mr woodhouse\\ntaken from hartfieldno he felt that it ought not to be attempted\\nbut the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted\\nhis dearest emma would not find in any respect objectionable\\nit was that he should be received at hartfield that so long as\\nher fathers happiness in other words his liferequired hartfield\\nto continue her home it should be his likewise\\n\\nof their all removing to donwell emma had already had her own\\npassing thoughts  like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it\\nbut such an alternative as this had not occurred to her\\nshe was sensible of all the affection it evinced  she felt that\\nin quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence\\nof hours and habits that in living constantly with her father\\nand in no house of his own there would be much very much\\nto be borne with  she promised to think of it and advised him\\nto think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection\\ncould alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject  he had\\ngiven it he could assure her very long and calm consideration\\nhe had been walking away from william larkins the whole morning\\nto have his thoughts to himself\\n\\nah there is one difficulty unprovided for cried emma  i am\\nsure william larkins will not like it  you must get his consent\\nbefore you ask mine\\n\\nshe promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover\\nto think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme\\n\\nit is remarkable that emma in the many very many points of view\\nin which she was now beginning to consider donwell abbey was never\\nstruck with any sense of injury to her nephew henry whose rights\\nas heirexpectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded\\nthink she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy\\nand yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it\\nand found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent\\ndislike of mr knightleys marrying jane fairfax or any body else\\nwhich at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of\\nthe sister and the aunt\\n\\nthis proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield\\nthe more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became\\nhis evils seemed to lessen her own advantages to increase\\ntheir mutual good to outweigh every drawback  such a companion\\nfor herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her\\nsuch a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be\\ngiving increase of melancholy\\n\\nshe would have been too happy but for poor harriet but every\\nblessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings\\nof her friend who must now be even excluded from hartfield\\nthe delightful family party which emma was securing for herself\\npoor harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a\\ndistance from  she would be a loser in every way  emma could not\\ndeplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment\\nin such a party harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise\\nbut for the poor girl herself it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity\\nthat was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment\\n\\nin time of course mr knightley would be forgotten that is\\nsupplanted but this could not be expected to happen very early\\nmr knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure\\nnot like mr elton  mr knightley always so kind so feeling\\nso truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be\\nless worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even\\nof harriet that she could be in love with more than three men\\nin one year\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xvi\\n\\n\\nit was a very great relief to emma to find harriet as desirous\\nas herself to avoid a meeting  their intercourse was painful\\nenough by letter  how much worse had they been obliged to meet\\n\\nharriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed\\nwithout reproaches or apparent sense of illusage and yet emma fancied\\nthere was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in\\nher style which increased the desirableness of their being separate\\nit might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an\\nangel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke\\n\\nshe had no difficulty in procuring isabellas invitation\\nand she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it\\nwithout resorting to inventionthere was a tooth amiss\\nharriet really wished and had wished some time to consult a dentist\\nmrs john knightley was delighted to be of use any thing of ill\\nhealth was a recommendation to herand though not so fond of a\\ndentist as of a mr wingfield she was quite eager to have harriet\\nunder her carewhen it was thus settled on her sisters side\\nemma proposed it to her friend and found her very persuadable\\nharriet was to go she was invited for at least a fortnight she was\\nto be conveyed in mr woodhouses carriageit was all arranged\\nit was all completed and harriet was safe in brunswick square\\n\\nnow emma could indeed enjoy mr knightleys visits now she\\ncould talk and she could listen with true happiness unchecked by\\nthat sense of injustice of guilt of something most painful\\nwhich had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was\\nnear her how much might at that moment and at a little distance\\nbe enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself\\n\\nthe difference of harriet at mrs goddards or in london made perhaps\\nan unreasonable difference in emmas sensations but she could not\\nthink of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment\\nwhich must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself\\n\\nshe would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\\nin her mind which harriet had occupied  there was a communication\\nbefore her one which she only could be competent to make\\nthe confession of her engagement to her father but she would\\nhave nothing to do with it at presentshe had resolved to defer\\nthe disclosure till mrs weston were safe and well  no additional\\nagitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved\\nand the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the\\nappointed timea fortnight at least of leisure and peace of mind\\nto crown every warmer but more agitating delight should be hers\\n\\nshe soon resolved equally as a duty and a pleasure to employ half\\nan hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on miss fairfax\\nshe ought to goand she was longing to see her the resemblance of\\ntheir present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill\\nit would be a secret satisfaction but the consciousness of a\\nsimilarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with\\nwhich she should attend to any thing jane might communicate\\n\\nshe wentshe had driven once unsuccessfully to the door but had\\nnot been into the house since the morning after box hill when poor\\njane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion\\nthough all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected\\nthe fear of being still unwelcome determined her though assured\\nof their being at home to wait in the passage and send up her name\\nshe heard patty announcing it but no such bustle succeeded as poor\\nmiss bates had before made so happily intelligibleno she heard\\nnothing but the instant reply of beg her to walk upand a moment\\nafterwards she was met on the stairs by jane herself coming eagerly\\nforward as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient\\nemma had never seen her look so well so lovely so engaging\\nthere was consciousness animation and warmth there was every\\nthing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted\\nshe came forward with an offered hand and said in a low but very\\nfeeling tone\\n\\nthis is most kind indeedmiss woodhouse it is impossible\\nfor me to expressi hope you will believeexcuse me for being\\nso entirely without words\\n\\nemma was gratified and would soon have shewn no want of words\\nif the sound of mrs eltons voice from the sittingroom had not\\nchecked her and made it expedient to compress all her friendly\\nand all her congratulatory sensations into a very very earnest\\nshake of the hand\\n\\nmrs bates and mrs elton were together  miss bates was out\\nwhich accounted for the previous tranquillity  emma could have\\nwished mrs elton elsewhere but she was in a humour to have patience\\nwith every body and as mrs elton met her with unusual graciousness\\nshe hoped the rencontre would do them no harm\\n\\nshe soon believed herself to penetrate mrs eltons thoughts\\nand understand why she was like herself in happy spirits\\nit was being in miss fairfaxs confidence and fancying herself\\nacquainted with what was still a secret to other people\\nemma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face\\nand while paying her own compliments to mrs bates and appearing\\nto attend to the good old ladys replies she saw her with a sort\\nof anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently\\nbeen reading aloud to miss fairfax and return it into the purple\\nand gold reticule by her side saying with significant nods\\n\\nwe can finish this some other time you know  you and i shall\\nnot want

in a half whisper\\n\\ni mentioned no names you will observeoh no cautious as\\na minister of state  i managed it extremely well\\n\\nemma could not doubt  it was a palpable display repeated on

weather lasts\\nit must be the same party you know quite the same party\\nnot one exception\\n\\nsoon after this miss bates came in and emma could not help being diverted\\nby the perplexity of her first answer to herself resulting she supposed\\nfrom doubt of what might be said and impatience to say every thing\\n\\nthank you dear miss woodhouse you are all kindnessit is impossible\\nto sayyes

for my lord and master\\nhe promised to join me here and pay his respects to you\\n\\nwhat are we to have the pleasure of a call from mr elton\\nthat will be a favour indeed for i know gentlemen do

day said emma  i am almost certain\\nthat the meeting at the crown is not till tomorrowmr knightley\\nwas at hartfield yesterday and spoke of it as for saturday\\n\\noh no the meeting is certainly today was the abrupt answer\\nwhich denoted the impossibility of any blunder on mrs eltons side\\ni do believe she continued this is the most troublesome parish\\nthat ever was  we never heard of such things at maple grove\\n\\nyour parish there was small said jane\\n\\nupon my word my dear i do not know for i never heard the subject\\ntalked of\\n\\nbut it is proved by the smallness of the school which i have heard\\nyou speak of as under the patronage of your sister and mrs bragge\\nthe only school and not more than fiveandtwenty children\\n\\nah you clever creature thats very true  what a thinking brain\\nyou have  i say jane what a perfect character you and i should make\\nif we could be shaken together  my liveliness and your solidity\\nwould produce perfectionnot that i presume to insinuate however\\nthat some people may not think you perfection alreadybut hush\\nnot a word if you please\\n\\nit seemed an unnecessary caution jane was wanting to give her words\\nnot to mrs elton but to miss woodhouse as the latter plainly saw\\nthe wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted\\nwas very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look\\n\\nmr elton made his appearance  his lady greeted him with some\\nof her sparkling vivacity\\n\\nvery pretty sir upon my word to send me on here to be an\\nencumbrance to my friends so long before you vouchsafe to come\\nbut you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with\\nyou knew i should not stir till my lord and master appeared\\nhere have i been sitting this hour giving these young ladies\\na sample of true conjugal obediencefor who can say you know\\nhow soon it may be wanted\\n\\nmr elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away\\nhis civilities to the other ladies must be paid but his subsequent\\nobject was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering\\nand the walk he had had for nothing\\n\\nwhen i got to donwell said he knightley could not be found\\nvery odd very unaccountable after the note i sent him this morning\\nand the message he returned that he should certainly be at home\\ntill one\\n\\ndonwell cried his wifemy dear mr e you have not been\\nto donwellyou mean the crown you come from the meeting at the crown\\n\\nno no thats tomorrow and i particularly wanted to see knightley\\ntoday on that very accountsuch a dreadful broiling morning\\ni went over the fields toospeaking in a tone of great illusage\\nwhich made it so much the worse  and then not to find him at home\\ni assure you i am not at all pleased  and no apology left no message\\nfor me  the housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected\\nvery extraordinaryand nobody knew at all which way he was gone\\nperhaps to hartfield perhaps to the abbey mill perhaps into his woods\\nmiss woodhouse this is not like our friend knightleycan you\\nexplain it\\n\\nemma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary\\nindeed and that she had not a syllable to say for him\\n\\ni cannot imagine said mrs elton feeling the indignity as a wife\\nought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you\\nof all people in the world  the very last person whom one should expect\\nto be forgottenmy dear mr e he must have left a message for you\\ni am sure he mustnot even knightley could be so very eccentric\\nand his servants forgot it  depend upon it that was the case\\nand very likely to happen with the donwell servants who are all\\ni have often observed extremely awkward and remissi am sure i\\nwould not have such a creature as his harry stand at our sideboard\\nfor any consideration  and as for mrs hodges wright holds\\nher very cheap indeedshe promised wright a receipt and never\\nsent it\\n\\ni met william larkins continued mr elton as i got near\\nthe house and he told me i should not find his master at home\\nbut i did not believe himwilliam seemed rather out of humour\\nhe did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he\\ncould hardly ever get the speech of him  i have nothing to do with\\nwilliams wants but it really is of very great importance that i\\nshould see knightley today and it becomes a matter therefore\\nof very serious inconvenience that i should have had this hot walk\\nto no purpose\\n\\nemma felt that she could not do better than go home directly\\nin all probability she was at this very time waited for there\\nand mr knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression\\ntowards mr elton if not towards william larkins\\n\\nshe was pleased on taking leave to find miss fairfax determined\\nto attend her out of the room to go with her even downstairs\\nit gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of\\nto say\\n\\nit is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility\\nhad you not been surrounded by other friends i might have been\\ntempted to introduce a subject to ask questions to speak more\\nopenly than might have been strictly correcti feel that i should\\ncertainly have been impertinent\\n\\noh cried jane with a blush and an hesitation which emma thought\\ninfinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her\\nusual composurethere would have been no danger  the danger\\nwould have been of my wearying you  you could not have gratified\\nme more than by expressing an interest  indeed miss woodhouse\\nspeaking more collectedly with the consciousness which i\\nhave of misconduct very great misconduct it is particularly\\nconsoling to me to know that those of my friends whose good\\nopinion is most worth preserving are not disgusted to such a\\ndegree as toi have not time for half that i could wish to say\\ni long to make apologies excuses to urge something for myself\\ni feel it so very due  but unfortunatelyin short if your\\ncompassion does not stand my friend\\n\\noh you are too scrupulous indeed you are cried emma warmly\\nand taking her hand  you owe me no

be that we are to lose you\\njust as i begin to know you\\n\\noh as to all that of course nothing can be thought of yet\\ni am here till claimed by colonel and mrs campbell\\n\\nnothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma\\nsmilingbut excuse me it must be thought of\\n\\nthe smile was returned as jane answered\\n\\nyou are very right it has been thought of  and i will own\\nto you i am sure it will be safe that so far as our living\\nwith mr churchill at enscombe it is settled  there must be\\nthree months at least of deep mourning but when they are over\\ni imagine there will be nothing more to wait for\\n\\nthank you thank youthis is just what i wanted to be assured of\\noh if you knew how much i love every thing that is decided and open\\ngoodbye

was unmentioned\\n\\njohn enters like a brother into my happiness continued mr knightley\\nbut he is no complimenter and though i well know him to have\\nlikewise a most brotherly affection for you he is so far from\\nmaking flourishes that any other young woman might think him rather\\ncool in her praise  but i am not afraid of your seeing what he writes\\n\\nhe writes like a sensible man replied emma when she had read\\nthe letter  i honour his sincerity  it is very plain that he\\nconsiders the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side\\nbut that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy\\nof your affection as you think me already  had he said any thing\\nto bear a different construction i should not have believed him\\n\\nmy emma he means no such thing  he only means\\n\\nhe and i should differ very little in our estimation of the two\\ninterrupted she with a sort of serious smilemuch less perhaps\\nthan he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve\\non the subject\\n\\nemma my dear emma\\n\\noh she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your\\nbrother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in\\nthe secret and hear his opinion  depend upon it he will be much\\nfarther from doing you justice  he will think all the happiness\\nall the advantage on your side of the question all the merit\\non mine  i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once\\nhis tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther\\n\\nah he cried i wish your father might be half as easily convinced\\nas john will be of our having every right that equal worth can give\\nto be happy together  i am amused by one part of johns letter\\ndid you notice itwhere he says that my information did not take\\nhim wholly by surprize that he was rather in expectation of hearing\\nsomething of the kind\\n\\nif i understand your brother he only means so far as your having\\nsome thoughts of marrying  he had no idea of me  he seems perfectly\\nunprepared for that\\n\\nyes yesbut i am amused that he should have seen so far into\\nmy feelings  what has he been judging byi am not conscious\\nof any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare\\nhim at this time for my marrying any more than at another\\nbut it was so i suppose  i dare say there was a difference when i\\nwas staying with them the other day  i believe i did not play\\nwith the children quite so much as usual  i remember one evening\\nthe poor boys saying uncle seems always tired now\\n\\nthe time was coming when the news must spread farther and other persons\\nreception of it tried  as soon as mrs weston was sufficiently\\nrecovered to admit mr woodhouses visits emma having it in view\\nthat her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause\\nresolved first to announce it at home and then at randalls\\nbut how to break it to her father at lastshe had bound herself\\nto do it in such an hour of mr knightleys absence or when it\\ncame to the point her heart would have failed her and she must\\nhave put it off but mr knightley was to come at such a time\\nand follow up the beginning she was to makeshe was forced\\nto speak and to speak cheerfully too  she must not make it a more\\ndecided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself\\nshe must not appear to think it a misfortunewith all the spirits\\nshe could command she prepared him first for something strange\\nand then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation\\ncould be obtainedwhich she trusted would be attended with\\nno difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all\\nshe and mr knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield\\nwould receive the constant addition of that persons company\\nwhom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs weston\\nbest in the world\\n\\npoor manit was at first a considerable shock to him and he tried\\nearnestly to dissuade her from it  she was reminded more than once\\nof having always said she would never marry and assured that it\\nwould be a great deal better for her to remain single and told of\\npoor isabella and poor miss taylorbut it would not do  emma hung\\nabout him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that\\nhe must not class her with isabella and mrs weston whose marriages\\ntaking them from hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change\\nbut she was not going from hartfield she should be always there\\nshe was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but\\nfor the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal\\nthe happier for having mr knightley always at hand when he were once\\ngot used to the ideadid he not love mr knightley very much\\nhe would not deny that he did she was surewhom did he ever want\\nto consult on business but mr knightleywho was so useful to him\\nwho so ready to write his letters who so glad to assist him\\nwho so cheerful so attentive so attached to himwould not he\\nlike to have him always on the spotyes  that was all very true\\nmr knightley could not be there too often he should be glad to see\\nhim every daybut they did see him every day as it waswhy could\\nnot they go on as they had done\\n\\nmr woodhouse could not be soon reconciled but the worst was overcome\\nthe idea was given time and continual repetition must do the rest\\nto emmas entreaties and assurances succeeded mr knightleys\\nwhose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome\\nand he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion\\nthey had all the assistance which isabella could give by letters\\nof the strongest approbation and mrs weston was ready\\non the first meeting to consider the subject in the most\\nserviceable lightfirst as a settled and secondly as a good one\\nwell aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations\\nto mr woodhouses mindit was agreed upon as what was to be\\nand every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that\\nit would be for his happiness and having some feelings himself\\nwhich almost admitted it he began to think that some time or other\\nin another year or two perhapsit might not be so very bad\\nif the marriage did take place\\n\\nmrs weston was acting no part feigning no feelings in all that she\\nsaid to him in favour of the eventshe had been extremely surprized\\nnever more so than when emma first opened the affair to her\\nbut she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had\\nno scruple in urging him to the utmostshe had such a regard\\nfor mr knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest emma\\nand it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable\\na connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance\\nso peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed\\nas if emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature\\nand that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having\\nthought of it and wished it long agohow very few of those men\\nin a rank of life to address emma would have renounced their own\\nhome for hartfield  and who but mr knightley could know and bear\\nwith mr woodhouse so as to make such an arrangement desirable\\nthe difficulty of disposing of poor mr woodhouse had been always\\nfelt in her husbands plans and her own for a marriage between frank\\nand emma  how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had\\nbeen a continual impedimentless acknowledged by mr weston than\\nby herselfbut even he had never been able to finish the subject\\nbetter than by sayingthose matters will take care of themselves\\nthe young people will find a way  but here there was nothing to be\\nshifted off in a wild speculation on the future  it was all right\\nall open all equal  no sacrifice on any side worth the name\\nit was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself\\nand without one real rational difficulty to oppose or delay it\\n\\nmrs weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections\\nas these was one of the happiest women in the world  if any thing\\ncould increase her delight it was perceiving that the baby would\\nsoon have outgrown its first set of caps\\n\\nthe news was universally a surprize wherever it spread\\nand mr weston had his five minutes share of it but five minutes\\nwere enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind\\nhe saw the advantages of the match and rejoiced in them with all\\nthe constancy of his wife but the wonder of it was very soon nothing\\nand by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he\\nhad always foreseen it\\n\\nit is to be a secret i conclude said he  these matters are\\nalways a secret till it is found out that every body knows them\\nonly let me be told when i may speak outi wonder whether jane has\\nany suspicion\\n\\nhe went to highbury the next morning and satisfied himself on\\nthat point  he told her the news  was not she like a daughter\\nhis eldest daughterhe must tell her and miss bates being present\\nit passed of course to mrs cole mrs perry and mrs elton\\nimmediately afterwards  it was no more than the principals were\\nprepared for they had calculated from the time of its being known\\nat randalls how soon it would be over highbury and were thinking\\nof themselves as the evening wonder in many a family circle\\nwith great sagacity\\n\\nin general it was a very well approved match  some might think him\\nand others might think her the most in luck  one set might\\nrecommend their all removing to donwell and leaving hartfield\\nfor the john knightleys and another might predict disagreements\\namong their servants but yet upon the whole there was no serious\\nobjection raised except in one habitation the vicaragethere\\nthe surprize was not softened by any satisfaction  mr elton\\ncared little about it compared with his wife he only hoped the\\nyoung ladys pride would now be contented and supposed she had\\nalways meant to catch knightley if she could and on the point\\nof living at hartfield could daringly exclaim rather he than i\\nbut mrs elton was very much discomposed indeedpoor knightley\\npoor fellowsad business for himshe was extremely concerned\\nfor though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities\\nhow could he be so taken indid not think him at all in love\\nnot in the leastpoor knightleythere would be an end of all\\npleasant intercourse with himhow happy he had been to come and dine\\nwith them whenever they asked him  but that would be all over now\\npoor fellowno more exploring parties to donwell made for her\\noh no there would be a mrs knightley to throw cold water on\\nevery

who had tried it and been obliged to separate before the end\\nof the first quarter\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xviii\\n\\n\\ntime passed on  a few more tomorrows and the party from london\\nwould be arriving  it was an alarming change and emma was thinking\\nof it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and\\ngrieve her when mr knightley came in and distressing thoughts\\nwere put by  after the first chat of pleasure he was silent\\nand then in a graver tone began with\\n\\ni have something to tell you emma some news\\n\\ngood or bad said she quickly looking up in his face\\n\\ni do not know which it ought to be called\\n\\noh good i am surei see it in your countenance  you are trying\\nnot to smile\\n\\ni am afraid said he composing his features i am very much afraid\\nmy dear emma that you will not smile when you hear it\\n\\nindeed but why soi can hardly imagine that any thing which\\npleases or amuses you should not please and amuse me too\\n\\nthere is one subject he replied i hope but one on which\\nwe do not think alike  he paused a moment again smiling\\nwith his eyes fixed on her face  does nothing occur to you\\ndo not you recollectharriet smith\\n\\nher cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something\\nthough she knew not what\\n\\nhave you heard from her yourself this morning cried he\\nyou have i believe and know the whole\\n\\nno i have not i know nothing pray tell me\\n\\nyou are prepared for the worst i seeand very bad it is\\nharriet smith marries robert martin\\n\\nemma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared\\nand her eyes in eager gaze said no this is impossible\\nbut her lips were closed\\n\\nit is so indeed continued mr knightley i have it from robert\\nmartin himself  he left me not half an hour ago\\n\\nshe was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement\\n\\nyou like it my emma as little as i fearedi wish our opinions were\\nthe same  but in time they will  time you may be sure will make\\none or the other of us think differently and in the meanwhile\\nwe need not talk much on the subject\\n\\nyou mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself\\nit is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy\\nbut i cannot believe it  it seems an impossibilityyou cannot mean\\nto say that harriet smith has accepted robert martin  you cannot\\nmean that he has even proposed to her againyet  you only mean\\nthat he intends it\\n\\ni mean that he has done it answered mr knightley with smiling\\nbut determined decision and been accepted\\n\\ngood god she criedwellthen having recourse to her workbasket\\nin excuse for leaning down her face and concealing all the\\nexquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she\\nmust be expressing she added well now tell me every thing\\nmake this intelligible to me  how where whenlet me know it all\\ni never was more surprizedbut it does not make me unhappy\\ni assure youhowhow has it been possible\\n\\nit is a very simple story  he went to town on business three days ago\\nand i got him to take charge of some papers which i was wanting\\nto send to johnhe delivered these papers to john at his chambers\\nand was asked by him to join their party the same evening to astleys\\nthey were going to take the two eldest boys to astleys the party\\nwas to be our brother and sister henry johnand miss smith\\nmy friend robert could not resist  they called for him in their way\\nwere all extremely amused and my brother asked him to dine with\\nthem the next daywhich he didand in the course of that visit\\nas i understand he found an opportunity of speaking to harriet\\nand certainly did not speak in vainshe made him by her acceptance\\nas happy even as he is deserving  he came down by yesterdays coach\\nand was with me this morning immediately after breakfast to report\\nhis proceedings first on my affairs and then on his own\\nthis is all that i can relate of the how where and when\\nyour friend harriet will make a much longer history when you see her\\nshe will give you all the minute particulars which only womans\\nlanguage can make interestingin our communications we deal only\\nin the greathowever i must say that robert martins heart seemed\\nfor him and to me very overflowing and that he did mention\\nwithout its being much to the purpose that on quitting their\\nbox at astleys my brother took charge of mrs john knightley\\nand little john and he followed with miss smith and henry\\nand that at one time they were in such a crowd as to make miss smith\\nrather uneasy\\n\\nhe stoppedemma dared not attempt any immediate reply  to speak\\nshe was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree\\nof happiness  she must wait a moment or he would think her mad\\nher silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while\\nhe added\\n\\nemma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make\\nyou unhappy but i am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected\\nhis situation is an evilbut you must consider it as what satisfies\\nyour friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better\\nof him as you know him more  his good sense and good principles would\\ndelight youas far as the man is concerned you could not wish your\\nfriend in better hands  his rank in society i would alter if i could\\nwhich is saying a great deal i assure you emmayou laugh at me\\nabout william larkins but i could quite as ill spare robert martin\\n\\nhe wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself\\nnot to smile too broadlyshe didcheerfully answering\\n\\nyou need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match  i think\\nharriet is doing extremely well  her connexions may be worse than his\\nin respectability of character there can be no doubt that they are\\ni have been silent from surprize merely excessive surprize\\nyou cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me how peculiarly\\nunprepared i wasfor i had reason to believe her very lately more\\ndetermined against him much more than she was before\\n\\nyou ought to know your friend best replied mr knightley\\nbut i should say she was a goodtempered softhearted girl\\nnot likely to be very very determined against any young man who told\\nher he loved her\\n\\nemma could not help laughing as she answered upon my word\\ni believe you know her quite as well as i dobut mr knightley\\nare you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright\\naccepted him  i could suppose she might in timebut can she already\\ndid not you misunderstand himyou were both talking of other things\\nof business shows of cattle or new drillsand might not you\\nin the confusion of so many subjects mistake himit was not\\nharriets hand that he was certain ofit was the dimensions of some\\nfamous ox\\n\\nthe contrast between the countenance and air of mr knightley and\\nrobert martin was at this moment so strong to emmas feelings\\nand so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently\\npassed on harriets side so fresh the sound of those words\\nspoken with such emphasis no i hope i know better than to think\\nof robert martin that she was really expecting the intelligence\\nto prove in some measure premature  it could not be otherwise\\n\\ndo you dare say this cried mr knightley  do you dare to suppose\\nme so great a blockhead as not to know what a man is talking of\\nwhat do you deserve\\n\\noh  i always deserve the best treatment because i never put\\nup with any other and therefore you must give me a plain\\ndirect answer  are you quite sure that you understand the terms\\non which mr martin and harriet now are\\n\\ni am quite sure he replied speaking very distinctly that he\\ntold me she had accepted him and that there was no obscurity\\nnothing doubtful in the words he used and i think i can give you\\na proof that it must be so  he asked my opinion as to what he\\nwas now to do  he knew of no one but mrs goddard to whom he\\ncould apply for information of her relations or friends  could i\\nmention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard\\ni assured him that i could not  then he said he would endeavour\\nto see her in the course of this day\\n\\ni am perfectly satisfied replied emma with the brightest smiles\\nand most sincerely wish them happy\\n\\nyou are materially changed since we talked on this subject before\\n\\ni hope sofor at that time i was a fool\\n\\nand i am changed also for i am now very willing to grant you all\\nharriets good qualities  i have taken some pains for your sake\\nand for robert martins sake whom i have always had reason to believe\\nas much in love with her as ever to get acquainted with her\\ni have often talked to her a good deal  you must have seen that\\ni did  sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me\\nof pleading poor martins cause which was never the case but from all\\nmy observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl\\nwith very good notions very seriously good principles and placing\\nher happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life\\nmuch of this i have no doubt she may thank you for\\n\\nme cried emma shaking her headah poor harriet\\n\\nshe checked herself however and submitted quietly to a little\\nmore praise than she deserved\\n\\ntheir conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of\\nher father  she was not sorry  she wanted to be alone  her mind\\nwas in a state of flutter and wonder which made it impossible for her\\nto be collected  she was in dancing singing exclaiming spirits\\nand till she had moved about and talked to herself and laughed\\nand reflected she could be fit for nothing rational\\n\\nher fathers business was to announce jamess being gone out to put\\nthe horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls\\nand she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing\\n\\nthe joy the gratitude the exquisite delight of her sensations\\nmay be imagined  the sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the\\nprospect of harriets welfare she was really in danger of becoming\\ntoo happy for securitywhat had she to wish for  nothing but to\\ngrow more worthy of him whose intentions and judgment had been\\never so superior to her own  nothing but that the lessons\\nof her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future\\n\\nserious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions\\nand yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst\\nof them  she must laugh at such a close  such an end of the doleful\\ndisappointment of five weeks back  such a heartsuch a harriet\\n\\nnow there would be pleasure in her returningevery thing would\\nbe a pleasure  it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin\\n\\nhigh in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities\\nwas the reflection that all necessity of concealment from\\nmr knightley would soon be over  the disguise equivocation\\nmystery so hateful to her to practise might soon be over\\nshe could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect\\nconfidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty\\n\\nin the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father\\nnot always listening but always agreeing to what he said\\nand whether in speech or silence conniving at the comfortable\\npersuasion of his being obliged to go to randalls every day\\nor poor mrs weston would be disappointed\\n\\nthey arrivedmrs weston was alone in the drawingroom\\nbut hardly had they been told of the baby and mr woodhouse\\nreceived the thanks for coming which he asked for when a glimpse\\nwas caught through the blind of two figures passing near the window\\n\\nit is frank and miss fairfax said mrs weston  i was just\\ngoing to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive\\nthis morning  he stays till tomorrow and miss fairfax has been\\npersuaded to spend the day with usthey are coming in i hope\\n\\nin half a minute they were in the room  emma was extremely glad\\nto see himbut there was a degree of confusiona number of\\nembarrassing recollections on each side  they met readily and smiling\\nbut with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said\\nand having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank\\nin the circle that emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged\\nwhich she had long felt of seeing frank churchill once more\\nand of seeing him with jane would yield its proportion of pleasure\\nwhen mr weston joined the party however and when the baby\\nwas fetched there was no longer a want of subject or animation\\nor of courage and opportunity for frank churchill to draw near her\\nand say\\n\\ni have to thank you miss woodhouse for a very kind forgiving\\nmessage in one of mrs westons letters  i hope time has not made\\nyou less willing to pardon  i hope you do not retract what you\\nthen said\\n\\nno indeed cried emma most happy to begin not in the least\\ni am particularly glad to see and shake hands with youand to give\\nyou joy in person\\n\\nhe thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak\\nwith serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness\\n\\nis not she looking well said he turning his eyes towards jane\\nbetter than she ever used to doyou see how my father and\\nmrs weston doat upon her\\n\\nbut his spirits were soon rising again and with laughing eyes\\nafter mentioning the expected return of the campbells he named\\nthe name of dixonemma blushed and forbade its being pronounced\\nin her hearing\\n\\ni can never think of it she cried without extreme shame\\n\\nthe shame he answered is all mine or ought to be  but is it\\npossible that you had no suspicioni mean of late  early i know\\nyou had none\\n\\ni never had the smallest i assure you\\n\\nthat appears quite wonderful  i was once very nearand i wish i had\\nit would have been better  but though i was always doing wrong things\\nthey were very bad wrong things and such as did me no service\\nit would have been a much better transgression had i broken the bond\\nof secrecy and told you every thing\\n\\nit is not now worth a regret said emma\\n\\ni have some hope resumed he of my uncles being persuaded\\nto pay a visit at randalls he wants to be introduced to her\\nwhen the campbells are returned we shall meet them in london\\nand continue there i trust till we may carry her northwardbut now\\ni am at such a distance from heris not it hard miss woodhouse\\ntill this morning we have not once met since the day of reconciliation\\ndo not you pity me\\n\\nemma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession\\nof gay thought he cried\\n\\nah by the bye then sinking his voice and looking demure for\\nthe momenti hope mr knightley is well  he pausedshe coloured\\nand laughedi know you saw my letter and think you may remember\\nmy wish in your favour  let me return your congratulations\\ni assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest\\nand satisfactionhe is a man whom i cannot presume to praise\\n\\nemma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style\\nbut his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his\\nown jane and his next words were\\n\\ndid you ever see such a skinsuch smoothness such delicacy\\nand yet without being actually fairone cannot call her fair\\nit is a most uncommon complexion with her dark eyelashes and hair\\na most distinguishing complexion  so peculiarly the lady in it\\njust colour enough for beauty\\n\\ni have always admired her complexion replied emma archly but do not\\ni remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale\\nwhen we first began to talk of herhave you quite forgotten\\n\\noh nowhat an impudent dog i washow could i dare\\n\\nbut he laughed so heartily at the recollection that emma could\\nnot help saying\\n\\ni do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time\\nyou had very great amusement in tricking us alli am sure you had\\ni am sure it was a consolation to you\\n\\noh no no nohow can you suspect me of such a thing\\ni was the most miserable wretch\\n\\nnot quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth  i am sure it\\nwas a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking\\nus all inperhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell\\nyou the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself\\nin the same situation  i think there is a little likeness between us\\n\\nhe bowed\\n\\nif not in our dispositions she presently added with a look of\\ntrue sensibility there is a likeness in our destiny the destiny\\nwhich bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior\\nto our own\\n\\ntrue true he answered warmly  no not true on your side  you can\\nhave no superior but most true on mineshe is a complete angel\\nlook at her  is not she an angel in every gesture  observe the turn\\nof her throat  observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father\\nyou will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously\\nthat my uncle means to give her all my aunts jewels  they are to be\\nnew set  i am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head\\nwill not it be beautiful in her dark hair\\n\\nvery beautiful indeed replied emma and she spoke so kindly\\nthat he gratefully burst out\\n\\nhow delighted i am to see you again and to see you in such\\nexcellent looksi would not have missed this meeting for the world\\ni should certainly have called at hartfield had you failed to come\\n\\nthe others had been talking of the child mrs weston giving an\\naccount of a little alarm she had been under the evening before\\nfrom the infants appearing not quite well  she believed she had\\nbeen foolish but it had alarmed her and she had been within half\\na minute of sending for mr perry  perhaps she ought to be ashamed\\nbut mr weston had been almost as uneasy as herselfin ten minutes\\nhowever the child had been perfectly well again  this was\\nher history and particularly interesting it was to mr woodhouse\\nwho commended her very much for thinking of sending for perry\\nand only regretted that she had not done it  she should always send\\nfor perry if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered\\nwere it only for a moment  she could not be too soon alarmed\\nnor send for perry too often  it was a pity perhaps that he\\nhad not come last night for though the child seemed well now\\nvery well considering it would probably have been better if perry\\nhad seen it\\n\\nfrank churchill caught the name\\n\\nperry said he to emma and trying as he spoke to catch miss\\nfairfaxs eye  my friend mr perry  what are they saying\\nabout mr perryhas he been here this morningand how does\\nhe travel nowhas he set up his carriage\\n\\nemma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined\\nin the laugh it was evident from janes countenance that she\\ntoo was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf\\n\\nsuch an extraordinary dream of mine he cried  i can never think\\nof it without laughingshe hears us she hears us miss woodhouse\\ni see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown\\nlook at her  do not you see that at this instant the very passage\\nof her own letter which sent me the report is passing under her eye\\nthat the whole blunder is spread before herthat she can attend to\\nnothing else though pretending to listen to the others\\n\\njane was forced to smile completely for a moment and the smile\\npartly remained as she turned towards him and said in a conscious\\nlow yet steady voice\\n\\nhow you can bear such recollections is astonishing to me\\nthey will sometimes obtrudebut how you can court them\\n\\nhe had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly\\nbut emmas feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on\\nleaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men\\nshe felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill\\nand really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never\\nbeen more sensible of mr knightleys high superiority of character\\nthe happiness of this most happy day received its completion in the\\nanimated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter xix\\n\\n\\nif emma had still at intervals an anxious feeling for harriet\\na momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured\\nof her attachment to mr knightley and really able to accept\\nanother man from unbiased inclination it was not long that she\\nhad to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty\\na very few days brought the party from london and she had no\\nsooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet\\nthan she became perfectly satisfiedunaccountable as it was\\nthat robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr knightley\\nand was now forming all her views of happiness\\n\\nharriet was a little distresseddid look a little foolish at first\\nbut having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly\\nand selfdeceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die\\naway with the words and leave her without a care for the past\\nand with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to\\nher friends approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of\\nthat nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations\\nharriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at\\nastleys and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all\\nwith the utmost delight  but what did such particulars explain\\nthe fact was as emma could now acknowledge that harriet had\\nalways liked robert martin and that his continuing to love her had\\nbeen irresistiblebeyond this it must ever be unintelligible\\nto emma\\n\\nthe event however was most joyful and every day was giving her\\nfresh reason for thinking soharriets parentage became known\\nshe proved to be the daughter of a tradesman rich enough to afford\\nher the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers and decent\\nenough to have always wished for concealmentsuch was the blood\\nof gentility which emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for\\nit was likely to be as untainted perhaps as the blood of many\\na gentleman  but what a connexion had she been preparing for\\nmr knightleyor for the churchillsor even for mr elton\\nthe stain of illegitimacy unbleached by nobility or wealth\\nwould have been a stain indeed\\n\\nno objection was raised on the fathers side the young man was\\ntreated liberally it was all as it should be  and as emma became\\nacquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield\\nshe fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth\\nwhich could

property was good\\nbut not equal to sir walters apprehension of the state required\\nin its possessor  while lady elliot lived there had been method\\nmoderation and economy which had just kept him within his income\\nbut with her had died all such rightmindedness and from that period\\nhe had been constantly exceeding it  it had not been possible\\nfor him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot\\nwas imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was\\nnot only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often\\nthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially\\nfrom his daughter  he had given her some hints of it the last spring\\nin town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench\\ndoes it occur to you that there is any one article in which\\nwe can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first\\nardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done\\nand had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off\\nsome unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing\\nthe drawingroom to which expedients she afterwards added\\nthe happy thought of their taking no present down to

confess to her soon afterwards  elizabeth had nothing to propose\\nof deeper efficacy  she felt herself illused and unfortunate\\nas did her father and they were neither of them able to devise\\nany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity\\nor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne\\n\\nthere was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could

disgrace\\nhis name so far  the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole\\nand entire as he had received it\\n\\ntheir two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in\\nthe neighbouring market

judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense\\nhe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as\\nhe meant to see finally adopted\\n\\nlady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it\\nmuch serious consideration  she was a woman rather of sound than of\\nquick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision\\nin this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles\\nshe was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour\\nbut she was as desirous of saving sir walters feelings as solicitous\\nfor the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what\\nwas due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be\\nshe was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of\\nstrong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions\\nof decorum and with manners that were held a standard of goodbreeding\\nshe had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking\\nrational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry\\nshe had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little\\nto the faults of those who possessed them  herself the widow of\\nonly a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due\\nand sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance\\nan attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her\\nvery dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was\\nas being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal\\nof compassion and consideration under his present difficulties\\n\\nthey must retrench that did not admit of a doubt  but she was\\nvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him\\nand elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations\\nand she did what nobody else thought of doing  she consulted anne\\nwho never seemed considered by the others as having any interest\\nin the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her\\nin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted\\nto sir walter every emendation of annes had been on the side of\\nhonesty against importance  she wanted more vigorous measures\\na more complete reformation a quicker release from debt\\na much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity\\n\\nif we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell\\nlooking over her paper much may be done  if he will adopt\\nthese regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope\\nwe may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has\\na respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions\\nand that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from\\nlessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle\\nwhat will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families\\nhave done or ought to do  there will be nothing singular in his case\\nand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering\\nas it always does of our conduct  i have great hope of prevailing\\nwe must be serious and decided for after all the person who\\nhas contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to\\nthe feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father\\nthere is still more due to the character of an honest man\\n\\nthis was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding\\nhis friends to be urging him  she considered it as an act\\nof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with\\nall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments\\ncould secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it\\nshe wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty  she rated\\nlady russells influence highly and as to the severe degree\\nof selfdenial which her own conscience prompted she believed\\nthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete\\nthan to half a reformation  her knowledge of her father\\nand elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair\\nof horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on\\nthrough the whole list of lady russells too gentle reductions\\n\\nhow annes more rigid requisitions might have been taken\\nis of little consequence  lady russells had no success at all\\ncould not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort\\nof life knocked off  journeys london servants horses table\\ncontractions and restrictions every where  to live no longer\\nwith the decencies even of a private gentleman  no he would sooner\\nquit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms\\n\\nquit kellynch hall  the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd\\nwhose interest was involved in the reality of sir walters retrenching\\nand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without\\na change of abode  since the idea had been started in the very quarter\\nwhich ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing\\nhis judgement to be entirely on that side  it did not appear to him\\nthat sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house\\nwhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support\\nin any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would\\nbe looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way\\nhe might choose to model his household\\n\\nsir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more\\nof doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go\\nwas settled and the first outline of this important change made out\\n\\nthere had been three alternatives london bath or another house\\nin the country  all annes wishes had been for the latter\\na small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have\\nlady russells society still be near mary and still have the pleasure\\nof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object\\nof her ambition  but the usual fate of anne attended her\\nin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on\\nshe disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her\\nand bath was to be her home\\n\\nsir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt\\nthat he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enough\\nto dissuade him from it and make bath preferred  it was a much safer\\nplace for a gentleman in his predicament  he might there be important\\nat comparatively little expense  two material advantages of bath\\nover london had of course been given all their weight  its more convenient\\ndistance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russells spending\\nsome part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction\\nof lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been\\nfor bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that\\nthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there\\n\\nlady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear annes known wishes\\nit would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house\\nin his own neighbourhood  anne herself would have found\\nthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walters\\nfeelings they must have been dreadful  and with regard to annes\\ndislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising\\nfirst from the circumstance of her having been three years\\nat school there after her mothers death and secondly\\nfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter\\nwhich she had afterwards spent there with herself\\n\\nlady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think\\nit must suit them all and as to her young friends health\\nby passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge\\nevery danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must\\ndo both health and spirits good  anne had been too little from home\\ntoo little seen her spirits were not high  a larger society\\nwould improve them  she wanted her to be more known\\n\\nthe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood\\nfor sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part\\nand a very material part of the scheme which had been happily\\nengrafted on the beginning  he was not only to quit his home\\nbut to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude\\nwhich stronger heads than sir walters have found too much\\nkellynch hall was to be let  this however was a profound secret\\nnot to be breathed beyond their own circle\\n\\nsir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known\\nto design letting his house  mr shepherd had once mentioned the word\\nadvertise but never dared approach it again  sir walter spurned\\nthe idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint\\nbeing dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on\\nthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most\\nunexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour\\nthat he would let it at all\\n\\nhow quick come the reasons for approving what we like  lady russell had\\nanother excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter\\nand his family were to remove from the country  elizabeth had been\\nlately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted\\nit was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned\\nafter an unprosperous marriage to her fathers house with\\nthe additional burden of two children  she was a clever young woman\\nwho understood the art of pleasingthe art of pleasing at least\\nat kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot\\nas to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all\\nthat lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place\\ncould hint of caution and reserve\\n\\nlady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth\\nand seemed to love her rather because she would love her\\nthan because elizabeth deserved it  she had never received from her more\\nthan outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance\\nhad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry\\nagainst previous inclination  she had been repeatedly very earnest\\nin trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open\\nto all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements\\nwhich shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured\\nto give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience\\nbut always in vain  elizabeth would go her own way and never had she\\npursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in\\nthis selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving\\na sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought\\nto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility\\n\\nfrom situation mrs clay was in lady russells estimate a very unequal\\nand in her character she believed a very dangerous companion\\nand a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice\\nof more suitable intimates within miss elliots reach was therefore\\nan object of firstrate importance\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 3\\n\\n\\ni must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd\\none morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper\\nthat the present juncture is much in our favour  this peace will\\nbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore  they will be\\nall wanting a home  could not be a better time sir walter\\nfor having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants\\nmany a noble fortune has been made during the war  if a rich admiral\\nwere to come in our way sir walter\\n\\nhe would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter\\nthats all i have to remark  a prize indeed would kellynch hall\\nbe to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken\\never so many before hey shepherd\\n\\nmr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added\\n\\ni presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business\\ngentlemen of the navy are well to deal with  i have had a little knowledge\\nof their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they\\nhave very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants\\nas any set of people one should meet with  therefore sir walter\\nwhat i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of\\nany rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated\\nas a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep\\nthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice\\nand curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd\\nmight conceal any familymatters that i chose for nobody would think it\\nworth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him\\nwhich it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much\\ni venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if\\nwith all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad\\nin the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications\\nwill unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy\\nnaval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add\\nthat two hours will bring me over at any time to save you\\nthe trouble of replying\\n\\nsir walter only nodded  but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room\\nhe observed sarcastically\\n\\nthere are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would\\nnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description\\n\\nthey would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune\\nsaid mrs clay for mrs clay was present  her father had driven her over\\nnothing being of so much use to mrs clays health as a drive to kellynch\\nbut i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be\\na very desirable tenant  i have known a good deal of the profession\\nand besides their liberality they are so neat and careful\\nin all their ways  these valuable pictures of yours sir walter\\nif you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe  everything in\\nand about the house would be taken such excellent care of\\nthe gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order\\nas they are now  you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own\\nsweet flower gardens being neglected\\n\\nas to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced\\nto let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges\\nto be annexed to it  i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant\\nthe park would be open to him of course and few navy officers\\nor men of any other description can have had such a range\\nbut what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasuregrounds\\nis another thing  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being\\nalways approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard\\nwith respect to her flower garden  i am very little disposed\\nto grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour\\ni assure you be he sailor or soldier\\n\\nafter a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say\\n\\nin all these cases there are established usages which\\nmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant\\nyour interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands  depend upon me\\nfor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights\\ni venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous\\nfor his own as john shepherd will be for

give  sailors work hard enough\\nfor their comforts we must all allow\\n\\nvery true very true  what miss anne says is very true\\nwas mr shepherds rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughters\\nbut sir walters remark was soon afterwards\\n\\nthe profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see\\nany friend of mine belonging to it\\n\\nindeed was the reply and with a look of surprise\\n\\nyes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds\\nof objection to it  first as being the means of bringing persons\\nof obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours\\nwhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly\\nas it cuts up a mans youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old\\nsooner than any other man  i have observed it all my life\\na man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise\\nof one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to\\nand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in\\nany other line  one day last spring in town i was in company\\nwith two men striking instances of what i am talking of\\nlord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate\\nwithout bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives\\nand a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorablelooking personage\\nyou can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged\\nto the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side\\nand nothing but a dab of powder at top  in the name of heaven\\nwho is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near\\nsir basil morley  old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin\\nwhat do you take his age to be  sixty said i or perhaps sixtytwo\\nforty replied sir basil forty and no more  picture to yourselves\\nmy amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin\\ni never saw quite so wretched an example of what a seafaring life can do\\nbut to a degree i know it is the same with them all  they are all\\nknocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather\\ntill they are not fit to be seen  it is a pity they are not knocked\\non the head at once before they reach admiral baldwins age\\n\\nnay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed\\nhave a little mercy on the poor men  we are not all born to be handsome\\nthe sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes\\ni have observed it they soon lose the look of youth  but then\\nis not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other\\nsoldiers in active service are not at all better off  and even in\\nthe quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind\\nif not of the body which seldom leaves a mans looks to the natural\\neffect of time  the lawyer plods quite careworn the physician\\nis up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even\\nthe clergyman she stopt a moment to consider what might\\ndo for the clergymanand even the clergyman you know is obliged\\nto go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to\\nall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere  in fact as i have\\nlong been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable\\nin its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any\\nwho can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours\\nfollowing their own pursuits and living on their own property\\nwithout the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say\\nto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost\\ni know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness\\nwhen they cease to be quite young\\n\\nit seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak\\nsir walters good will towards a naval officer as tenant\\nhad been gifted with foresight for the very first application\\nfor the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards\\nfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed\\nhe had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent\\nby the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make\\nadmiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired\\na very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country\\nand had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places\\nin that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him\\nthat accidentally hearingit was just as he had foretold\\nmr shepherd observed sir walters concerns could not be kept a secret\\naccidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let\\nand understanding his mr shepherds connection with the owner\\nhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries\\nand had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong\\nan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description\\ncould feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself\\nevery proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant\\n\\nand who is admiral croft was sir walters cold suspicious inquiry\\n\\nmr shepherd answered for his being of a gentlemans family\\nand mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed\\nadded\\n\\nhe is a rear admiral of the white  he was in the trafalgar action\\nand has been in the east indies since he was stationed there\\ni believe several years\\n\\nthen i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face\\nis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery\\n\\nmr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale\\nhearty welllooking man a little weatherbeaten to be sure\\nbut not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour\\nnot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted\\na comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible\\nknew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a readyfurnished\\nhouse of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised\\nif sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor\\nwould be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it\\nsaid he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman\\n\\nmr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all\\nthe circumstances of the admirals family which made him\\npeculiarly desirable as a tenant  he was a married man\\nand without children the very state to be wished for  a house was\\nnever taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady\\nhe did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering\\nas much where there was no lady as where there were many children\\na lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture\\nin the world  he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton\\nwith the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were\\ntalking the matter over\\n\\nand a very wellspoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be\\ncontinued he asked more questions about the house and terms\\nand taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant\\nwith business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite\\nunconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say\\nshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once\\nshe told me so herself  sister to the gentleman who lived\\na few years back at monkford  bless me what was his name\\nat this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately\\npenelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman\\nwho lived at monkford  mrs crofts brother\\n\\nbut mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not\\nhear the appeal\\n\\ni have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember\\nno gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent\\n\\nbless me how very odd  i shall forget my own name soon i suppose\\na name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman\\nso well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once\\ni remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmers man\\nbreaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen\\ncaught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement\\nsubmitted to an amicable compromise  very odd indeed\\n\\nafter waiting another moment\\n\\nyou mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne\\n\\nmr shepherd was all gratitude\\n\\nwentworth was the very name  mr wentworth was the very man\\nhe had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back\\nfor two or three years  came there about the year 5 i take it\\nyou remember him i am sure\\n\\nwentworth  oh aymr wentworth the curate of monkford\\nyou misled me by the term gentleman  i thought you were speaking of\\nsome man of property  mr wentworth was nobody i remember\\nquite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family\\none wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common\\n\\nas mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them\\nno service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning\\nwith all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably\\nin their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea\\nthey had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for\\nthe advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked\\nnothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot\\nan extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in\\nthe secret of sir walters estimate of the dues of a tenant\\n\\nit succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with\\nan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them\\ninfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms\\nhe was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty\\nand authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained\\nat taunton and fix a day for the house being seen\\n\\nsir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough\\nof the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant\\nin all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer\\nso far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little\\nadditional soothing in the admirals situation in life which was just\\nhigh enough and not too high  i have let my house to admiral croft\\nwould sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr\\na mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs\\na note of explanation  an admiral speaks his own consequence\\nand at the same time can never make a baronet look small\\nin all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever\\nhave the precedence\\n\\nnothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth\\nbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removal\\nthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand\\nand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her\\n\\nmr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had\\nsuch an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener\\nto the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her\\nflushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said\\nwith a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps\\nmay be walking here\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 4\\n\\n\\nhe was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford\\nhowever suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth\\nhis brother who being made commander in consequence of the action\\noff st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire\\nin the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home\\nfor half a year at monkford  he was at that time a remarkably fine\\nyoung man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy\\nand anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste\\nand feeling  half the sum of attraction on either side might have\\nbeen enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love\\nbut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail\\nthey were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and\\ndeeply in love  it would be difficult to say which had seen\\nhighest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest\\nshe in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in\\nhaving them accepted\\n\\na short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one\\ntroubles soon arose  sir walter on being applied to without actually\\nwithholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all\\nthe negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence\\nand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter\\nhe thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with\\nmore tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one\\n\\nanne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind\\nto throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen\\nin an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself\\nto recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances\\nof a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure\\neven his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away\\nwhich she grieved to think of  anne elliot so young known to so few\\nto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune\\nor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious\\nyouthkilling dependence  it must not be if by any fair interference\\nof friendship any representations from one who had almost a mothers love\\nand mothers rights it would be prevented\\n\\ncaptain wentworth had no fortune  he had been lucky in his profession\\nbut spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing\\nbut he was confident that he should soon be rich\\nfull of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship\\nand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted\\nhe had always been lucky he knew he should be so still\\nsuch confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching in\\nthe wit which often expressed it must have been enough for anne\\nbut lady russell saw it very differently  his sanguine temper\\nand fearlessness of mind operated very differently on her\\nshe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil  it only added a\\ndangerous character to himself  he was brilliant he was headstrong\\nlady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching\\nto imprudence a horror  she deprecated the connexion in every light\\n\\nsuch opposition as these feelings produced was more than\\nanne could combat  young and gentle as she was it might yet\\nhave been possible to withstand her fathers illwill\\nthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister\\nbut lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not\\nwith such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner\\nbe continually advising her in vain  she was persuaded to believe\\nthe engagement a wrong thing  indiscreet improper hardly capable\\nof success and not deserving it  but it was not a merely selfish caution\\nunder which she acted in putting an end to it  had she not\\nimagined herself consulting his good even more than her own\\nshe could hardly have given him up  the belief of being prudent\\nand selfdenying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation\\nunder the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation\\nwas required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions\\non his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself\\nill used by so forced a relinquishment  he had left the country\\nin consequence\\n\\na few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance\\nbut not with a few months ended annes share of suffering from it\\nher attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every\\nenjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits\\nhad been their lasting effect\\n\\nmore than seven years were gone since this little history\\nof sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had\\nsoftened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him\\nbut she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given\\nin change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture\\nor in any novelty or enlargement of society  no one had ever\\ncome within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with\\nfrederick wentworth as he stood in her memory  no second attachment\\nthe only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure\\nat her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind\\nthe fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society\\naround them  she had been solicited when about twoandtwenty\\nto change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found\\na more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had\\nlamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man\\nwhose landed property and general importance were second in that country\\nonly to sir walters and of good character and appearance\\nand however lady russell might have asked yet for something more\\nwhile anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twentytwo\\nso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of\\nher fathers house and settled so permanently near herself\\nbut in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do\\nand though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion\\nnever wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety\\nwhich borders on hopelessness for annes being tempted by some man\\nof talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her\\nto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits\\n\\nthey knew not each others opinion either its constancy or its change\\non the one leading point of annes conduct for the subject was never\\nalluded to but anne at sevenandtwenty thought very differently\\nfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen  she did not blame\\nlady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her\\nbut she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances\\nto apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such\\ncertain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good\\nshe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home\\nand every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears\\ndelays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman\\nin maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it\\nand this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than\\nthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs\\nwithout reference to the actual results of their case which\\nas it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than\\ncould be reasonably calculated on  all his sanguine expectations\\nall his confidence had been justified  his genius and ardour\\nhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path\\nhe had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ\\nand all that he had told her would follow had taken place\\nhe had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank\\nand must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune\\nshe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority\\nbut she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy\\nshe had no reason to believe him married\\n\\nhow eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least\\nwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful\\nconfidence in futurity against that overanxious caution which\\nseems to insult exertion and distrust providence  she had been forced\\ninto prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older\\nthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginning\\n\\nwith all these circumstances recollections and feelings\\nshe could not hear that captain wentworths sister was likely\\nto live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll\\nand many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea\\nshe often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves\\nsufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts\\nand their business no evil  she was assisted however by that\\nperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three\\nof her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny\\nany recollection of it  she could do justice to the superiority\\nof lady russells motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth\\nshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmness\\nbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly important\\nfrom whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral crofts really\\ntaking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which\\nhad always been most grateful to her of the past being known to\\nthose three only among her connexions by whom no syllable\\nshe believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his\\nthe brother only with whom he had been residing had received\\nany information of their shortlived engagement  that brother had been\\nlong removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover\\na single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creatures\\nhaving heard of it from him\\n\\nthe sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying\\nher husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary\\nhad been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by\\nthe pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge\\nof it afterwards\\n\\nwith these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself\\nand the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch\\nand mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated\\nneed not involve any particular awkwardness\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 5\\n\\n\\non the morning appointed for admiral and mrs crofts seeing kellynch hall\\nanne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russells\\nand keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural\\nto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them\\n\\nthis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory\\nand decided the whole business at once  each lady was previously\\nwell disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore\\nbut good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen\\nthere was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality\\non the admirals side as could not but influence sir walter\\nwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished\\nbehaviour by mr shepherds assurances of his being known by report\\nto the admiral as a model of good breeding\\n\\nthe house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts\\nwere approved terms time every thing and every body was right\\nand mr shepherds clerks were set to work without there having been\\na single preliminary difference to modify of all that\\nthis indenture sheweth\\n\\nsir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be\\nthe bestlooking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say\\nthat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair\\nhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where\\nand the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife\\nas they drove back through the park i thought we should soon\\ncome to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton\\nthe baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be\\nno harm in him  reciprocal compliments which would have been\\nesteemed about equal\\n\\nthe crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter\\nproposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month\\nthere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement\\n\\nlady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use\\nor any importance in the choice of the house which they were\\ngoing to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon\\nand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might\\nconvey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements\\nof her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks\\nshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne\\nthough dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare\\nof bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad\\nof the autumnal months in the country did not think that\\neverything considered she wished to remain  it would be most right\\nand most wise and therefore must involve least suffering\\nto go with the others\\n\\nsomething occurred however to give her a different duty\\nmary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal\\nof her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne\\nwhen anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing\\nthat she should not have a days health all the autumn entreated\\nor rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to\\nuppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her\\ninstead of going to bath\\n\\ni cannot possibly do without anne was marys reasoning\\nand elizabeths reply was then i am sure anne had better stay\\nfor nobody will want her in bath\\n\\nto be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least\\nbetter than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to\\nbe thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty\\nand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country\\nand her own dear country readily agreed to stay\\n\\nthis invitation of marys removed all lady russells difficulties\\nand it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath\\ntill lady russell took her and that all the intervening time\\nshould be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge\\n\\nso far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled\\nby the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her\\nwhich was mrs clays being engaged to go to bath with sir walter\\nand elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter\\nin all the business before her  lady russell was extremely sorry\\nthat such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered\\ngrieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne\\nin mrs clays being of so much use while anne could be of none\\nwas a very sore aggravation\\n\\nanne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt\\nthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell\\nwith a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge\\nwhich she often wished less of her fathers character she was\\nsensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy\\nwere more than possible  she did not imagine that her father\\nhad at present an idea of the kind  mrs clay had freckles\\nand a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually\\nmaking severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young\\nand certainly altogether welllooking and possessed in an acute mind\\nand assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions\\nthan any merely personal might have been  anne was so impressed\\nby the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself\\nfrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister  she had little hope\\nof success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be\\nso much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought\\nhave reason to reproach her for giving no warning\\n\\nshe spoke and seemed only to offend  elizabeth could not conceive\\nhow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly\\nanswered for each partys perfectly knowing their situation\\n\\nmrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is\\nand as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be\\ni can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are\\nparticularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition\\nand rank more strongly than most people  and as to my father\\ni really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single\\nso long for our sakes need be suspected now  if mrs clay were\\na very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her\\nso much with me not that anything in the world i am sure\\nwould induce my father to make a degrading match but he might\\nbe rendered unhappy  but poor mrs clay who with all her merits\\ncan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor\\nmrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety  one would imagine\\nyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes\\nthough i know you must fifty times  that tooth of hers\\nand those freckles  freckles do not disgust me so very much\\nas they do him  i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few\\nbut he abominates them  you must have heard him notice\\nmrs clays freckles\\n\\nthere is hardly any personal defect replied anne\\nwhich an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to\\n\\ni think very differently answered elizabeth shortly\\nan agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never\\nalter plain ones  however at any rate as i have a great deal more\\nat stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it\\nrather unnecessary in you to be advising me\\n\\nanne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless\\nof doing good  elizabeth though resenting the suspicion\\nmight yet be made observant by it\\n\\nthe last office of the four carriagehorses was to draw sir walter\\nmiss elliot and mrs clay to bath  the party drove off in very good spirits\\nsir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted\\ntenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves\\nand anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillity\\nto the lodge where she was to spend the first week\\n\\nher friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this\\nbreakup of the family exceedingly  their respectability was\\nas dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become\\nprecious by habit  it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds\\nand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into\\nand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village\\nand be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived\\nshe had determined to make her own absence from home begin\\nwhen she must give up anne  accordingly their removal was made together\\nand anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage\\nof lady russells journey\\n\\nuppercross was a moderatesized village which a few years back\\nhad been completely in the old english style containing only\\ntwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers\\nthe mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees\\nsubstantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage\\nenclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a peartree\\ntrained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire\\nit had received the improvement of a farmhouse elevated into a cottage\\nfor his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda\\nfrench windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch\\nthe travellers eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect\\nand premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on\\n\\nhere anne had often been staying  she knew the ways of uppercross\\nas well as those of kellynch  the two families were so continually meeting\\nso much in the habit of running in and out of each others house\\nat all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone\\nbut being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost\\na matter of course  though better endowed than the elder sister\\nmary had not annes understanding nor temper  while well and happy\\nand properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits\\nbut any indisposition sunk her completely  she had no resources\\nfor solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot\\nselfimportance was very prone to add to every other distress\\nthat of fancying herself neglected and illused  in person she was\\ninferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached\\nthe dignity of being a fine girl  she was now lying on the faded sofa\\nof the pretty little drawingroom the once elegant furniture of which\\nhad been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers\\nand two children and on annes appearing greeted her with\\n\\nso you are come at last  i began to think i should never see you\\ni am so ill i can hardly speak  i have not seen a creature\\nthe whole morning\\n\\ni am sorry to find you unwell replied anne  you sent me\\nsuch a good account of yourself on thursday\\n\\nyes i made the best of it i always do  but i was very far from well\\nat the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life\\nas i have been all this morning  very unfit to be left alone i am sure\\nsuppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way\\nand not able to ring the bell  so lady russell would not get out\\ni do not think she has been in this house three times this summer\\n\\nanne said what was proper and enquired after her husband\\noh charles is out shooting  i have not seen him since seven oclock\\nhe would go though i told him how ill i was  he said he should not\\nstay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one\\ni assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning\\n\\nyou have had your little boys with you\\n\\nyes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable\\nthat they do me more harm than good  little charles does not mind\\na word i say and walter is growing quite as bad\\n\\nwell you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully\\nyou know i always cure you when i come  how are your neighbours\\nat the great house\\n\\ni can give you no account of them  i have not seen one of them today\\nexcept mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window\\nbut without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was\\nnot one of them have been near me  it did not happen to suit\\nthe miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves\\nout of their way\\n\\nyou will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone\\nit is early\\n\\ni never want them i assure you  they talk and laugh a great deal\\ntoo much for me  oh anne i am so very unwell  it was quite unkind\\nof you not to come on thursday\\n\\nmy dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself\\nyou wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well\\nand in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware\\nthat my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last\\nand besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy\\nhave had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have\\nleft kellynch sooner\\n\\ndear me what can you possibly have to do\\n\\na great many things i assure you  more than i can recollect\\nin a moment but i can tell you some  i have been making\\na duplicate of the catalogue of my fathers books and pictures\\ni have been several times in the garden with mackenzie\\ntrying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeths plants\\nare for lady russell  i have had all my own little concerns\\nto arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack\\nfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons\\nand one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature\\ngoing to almost every house in the parish as a sort of takeleave\\ni was told that they wished it  but all these things took up\\na great deal of time\\n\\noh well and after a moments pause but you have never asked me\\none word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday\\n\\ndid you go then  i have made no enquiries because i concluded\\nyou must have been obliged to give up the party\\n\\noh yes i went  i was very well yesterday nothing at all\\nthe matter with me till this morning  it would have been strange\\nif i had not gone\\n\\ni am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party\\n\\nnothing remarkable  one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be\\nand who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having\\na carriage of ones own  mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were\\nso crowded  they are both so very large and take up so much room\\nand mr musgrove always sits forward  so there was i crowded into\\nthe back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likely\\nthat my illness today may be owing to it\\n\\na little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness\\non annes side produced nearly a cure on marys  she could soon\\nsit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able\\nto leave it by dinnertime  then forgetting to think of it\\nshe was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay\\nthen she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough\\nto propose a little walk\\n\\nwhere shall we go said she when they were ready  i suppose\\nyou will not like to call at the great house before they have\\nbeen to see you\\n\\ni have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne\\ni should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know\\nso well as mrs and the miss musgroves\\n\\noh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible\\nthey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister  however\\nwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while and when we\\nhave that over we can enjoy our walk\\n\\nanne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent\\nbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that\\nthough there were on each side continual subjects of offence\\nneither family could now do without it  to the great house accordingly\\nthey went to sit the full half hour in the oldfashioned square parlour\\nwith a small carpet and shining floor to which the present\\ndaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion\\nby a grand pianoforte and a harp flowerstands and little tables\\nplaced in every direction  oh could the originals of the portraits\\nagainst the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and\\nthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious\\nof such an overthrow of all order and neatness  the portraits themselves\\nseemed to be staring in astonishment\\n\\nthe musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration\\nperhaps of improvement  the father and mother were in the old\\nenglish style and the young people in the new  mr and mrs musgrove\\nwere a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable\\nnot much educated and not at all elegant  their children had\\nmore modern minds and manners  there was a numerous family\\nbut the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa\\nyoung ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter\\nall the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands\\nof other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry\\ntheir dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty\\ntheir spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant\\nthey were of consequence at home and favourites abroad\\nanne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures\\nof her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some\\ncomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility\\nof exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant\\nand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing\\nbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together\\nthat goodhumoured mutual affection of which she had known\\nso little herself with either of her sisters\\n\\nthey were received with great cordiality  nothing seemed amiss\\non the side of the great house family which was generally\\nas anne very well knew the least to blame  the half hour was\\nchatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised\\nat the end of it to have their walking party joined by both\\nthe miss musgroves at marys particular invitation\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 6\\n\\n\\nanne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal\\nfrom one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles\\nwill often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea\\nshe had never been staying there before without being struck by it\\nor without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage\\nin seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs\\nwhich at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity\\nand pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed\\nshe must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing\\nour own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her\\nfor certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject\\nwhich had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks\\nshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found\\nin the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove\\nso miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath\\ndo you think they will settle in and this without much\\nwaiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of\\ni hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa\\nif we do go we must be in a good situation  none of your\\nqueen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of\\nupon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away\\nto be happy at bath\\n\\nshe could only resolve to avoid such selfdelusion in future\\nand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing\\nof having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell\\n\\nthe mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy\\ntheir own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females\\nwere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping\\nneighbours dress dancing and music  she acknowledged it to be\\nvery fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate\\nits own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become\\na not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into\\nwith the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross\\nit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory\\nand all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible\\n\\nshe had no dread of these two months  mary was not so repulsive\\nand unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers\\nneither was there anything among the other component parts\\nof the cottage inimical to comfort  she was always on friendly terms\\nwith her brotherinlaw and in the children who loved her nearly as well\\nand respected her a great deal more than their mother she had\\nan object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion\\n\\ncharles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was\\nundoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation\\nor grace to make the past as they were connected together\\nat all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time\\nanne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match\\nmight have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding\\nmight have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness\\nrationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits  as it was\\nhe did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise\\ntrifled away without benefit from books or anything else\\nhe had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by\\nhis wifes occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness\\nsometimes to annes admiration and upon the whole though there was\\nvery often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share\\nthan she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass\\nfor a happy couple  they were always perfectly agreed in the want\\nof more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present\\nfrom his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority\\nfor while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made\\nhe always contended for his fathers having many other uses for his money\\nand a right to spend it as he liked\\n\\nas to the management of their children his theory was much better\\nthan his wifes and his practice not so bad  i could manage them\\nvery well if it were not for marys interference was what\\nanne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in\\nbut when listening in turn to marys reproach of charles spoils\\nthe children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had\\nthe smallest temptation to say very true\\n\\none of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there\\nwas her being treated with too much confidence by all parties\\nand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house\\nknown to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested\\nor at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable\\ni wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill\\nwas charless language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary\\ni do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think\\nthere was anything the matter with me  i am sure anne if you would\\nyou might persuade him that i really am very illa great deal worse\\nthan i ever own\\n\\nmarys declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house\\nthough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours\\nand indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash\\nand sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross\\nfor the rest of the day  and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity\\nof being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing\\nmrs charles had a little of your method with those children\\nthey are quite different creatures with you  but to be sure\\nin general they are so spoilt  it is a pity you cannot put your sister\\nin the way of managing them  they are as fine healthy children\\nas ever were seen poor little dears without partiality\\nbut mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated\\nbless me how troublesome they are sometimes  i assure you miss anne\\nit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as\\ni otherwise should  i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased\\nwith my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad\\nto have children with one that one is obligated to be checking\\nevery moment dont do this and dont do that  or that one can\\nonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them\\n\\nshe had this communication moreover from mary  mrs musgrove thinks\\nall her servants so steady that it would be high treason\\nto call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration\\nthat her upper housemaid and laundrymaid instead of being\\nin their business are gadding about the village all day long\\ni meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery\\nwithout seeing something of them  if jemima were not the trustiest\\nsteadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her\\nfor she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them\\nand on mrs musgroves side it was i make a rule of never interfering\\nin any of my daughterinlaws concerns for i know it would not do\\nbut i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things\\nto rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charless nurserymaid\\ni hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from\\nmy own knowledge i can declare she is such a finedressing lady\\nthat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near\\nmrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint\\nthat you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss\\nyou need not be afraid of mentioning it\\n\\nagain it was marys complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt\\nnot to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined\\nat the great house with other families and she did not see any reason\\nwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place\\nand one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them\\nafter talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said\\ni have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are\\nabout their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent\\nyou are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that\\nit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious\\nespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take\\nplace of mamma  nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma\\nbut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it\\nit is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world\\nbut i know it is taken notice of by many persons\\n\\nhow was anne to set all these matters to rights  she could do little more\\nthan listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each\\nto the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary\\nbetween such near neighbours and make those hints broadest\\nwhich were meant for her sisters benefit\\n\\nin all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well\\nher own spirits improved by change of place and subject\\nby being removed three miles from kellynch marys ailments lessened\\nby having a constant companion and their daily intercourse\\nwith the other family since there was neither superior affection\\nconfidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it\\nwas rather an advantage  it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible\\nfor they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder\\nbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sight\\nof mr and mrs musgroves respectable forms in the usual places\\nor without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters\\n\\nshe played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves\\nbut having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents\\nto sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was\\nlittle thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others\\nas she was well aware  she knew that when she played she was\\ngiving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation\\nexcepting one short period of her life she had never since the age\\nof fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happiness\\nof being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste\\nin music she had been always used to feel alone in the world\\nand mr and mrs musgroves fond partiality for their own daughters\\nperformance and total indifference to any other persons\\ngave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification\\nfor her own\\n\\nthe party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company\\nthe neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited\\nby everybody and had more dinnerparties and more callers\\nmore visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family\\nthere were more completely popular\\n\\nthe girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally\\nin an unpremeditated little ball  there was a family of cousins\\nwithin a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances\\nwho depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures  they would come\\nat any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne\\nvery much preferring the office of musician to a more active post\\nplayed country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which\\nalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove\\nmore than anything else and often drew this compliment\\nwell done miss anne very well done indeed  lord bless me\\nhow those little fingers of yours fly about\\n\\nso passed the first three weeks  michaelmas came and now annes heart\\nmust be in kellynch again  a beloved home made over to others\\nall the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects\\nbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs  she could not\\nthink of much else on the 29th of september and she had this\\nsympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion\\nto note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this\\nthe day the crofts were to come to kellynch  i am glad i did not\\nthink of it before  how low it makes me\\n\\nthe crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were\\nto be visited  mary deplored the necessity for herself\\nnobody knew how much she should suffer  she should put it off\\nas long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles\\ninto driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated\\ncomfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back\\nanne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going\\nshe wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within\\nwhen the visit was returned  they came  the master of the house\\nwas not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced\\nthat mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary\\nand made himself very agreeable by his goodhumoured notice\\nof her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness\\nand if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice\\nor in the turn of sentiment and expression\\n\\nmrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness\\nuprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person\\nshe had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face\\nthough her reddened and weatherbeaten complexion the consequence\\nof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to\\nhave lived some years longer in the world than her real eightandthirty\\nher manners were open easy and decided like one who had\\nno distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any\\napproach to coarseness however or any want of good humour\\nanne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration\\ntowards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her\\nespecially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute\\nin the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest\\nsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs crofts side to give a bias\\nof any sort  she was quite easy on that head and consequently\\nfull of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by\\nmrs crofts suddenly saying\\n\\nit was you and not your sister i find that my brother had\\nthe pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country\\n\\nanne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion\\nshe certainly had not\\n\\nperhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft\\n\\nshe could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel\\nwhen mrs crofts next words explained it to be mr wentworth\\nof whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do\\nfor either brother she immediately felt how reasonable it was\\nthat mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward\\nand not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness\\napplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbours\\npresent state with proper interest\\n\\nthe rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving\\nshe heard the admiral say to mary\\n\\nwe are expecting a brother of mrs crofts here soon i dare say\\nyou know him by name\\n\\nhe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys\\nclinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go\\nand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away\\nin his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing\\nor recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself\\nas well as she could that the same brother must still be in question\\nshe could not however reach such a degree of certainty\\nas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject\\nat the other house where the crofts had previously been calling\\n\\nthe folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day\\nat the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits\\nto be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for\\nwhen the youngest miss musgrove walked in  that she was coming\\nto apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves\\nwas the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted\\nwhen louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot\\nto leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage\\n\\nand i will tell you our reason she added and all about it\\ni am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are\\nout of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much\\nof poor richard  and we agreed it would be best to have the harp\\nfor it seems to amuse her more than the pianoforte  i will tell you\\nwhy she is out of spirits  when the crofts called this morning\\nthey called here afterwards did not they they happened to say\\nthat her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england\\nor paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly\\nand most unluckily it came into mammas head when they were gone\\nthat wentworth or something very like it was the name of\\npoor richards captain at one time i do not know when or where\\nbut a great while before he died poor fellow  and upon looking over\\nhis letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure\\nthat this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it\\nand of poor richard  so we must be as merry as we can that she may not\\nbe dwelling upon such gloomy things\\n\\nthe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were\\nthat the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome\\nhopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached\\nhis twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid\\nand unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for\\nat any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved\\nseldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence\\nof his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before\\n\\nhe had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him\\nby calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thickheaded\\nunfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything\\nto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name\\nliving or dead\\n\\nhe had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals\\nto which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen\\nas every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board\\ncaptain frederick wentworths frigate the laconia and from the laconia\\nhe had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters\\nwhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole\\nof his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters\\nall the rest had been mere applications for money\\n\\nin each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet\\nso little were they in the habit of attending to such matters\\nso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships\\nthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove\\nshould have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection\\nof the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those\\nextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur\\n\\nshe had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed\\nand the reperusal of these letters after so long an interval\\nher poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten\\nhad affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into\\ngreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death\\nmr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when\\nthey reached the cottage they were evidently in want first\\nof being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards\\nof all the relief which cheerful companions could give them\\n\\nto hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name\\nso often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might\\nthat it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth\\nwhom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back\\nfrom cliftona very fine young manbut they could not say whether\\nit was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to annes nerves\\nshe found however that it was one to which she must inure herself\\nsince he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself\\nto be insensible on such points  and not only did it appear that\\nhe was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude\\nfor the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect\\nfor his character stamped as it was by poor dicks having been\\nsix months under his care and mentioning him in strong\\nthough not perfectly wellspelt praise as a fine dashing felow\\nonly two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on\\nintroducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as\\nthey could hear of his arrival\\n\\nthe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 7\\n\\n\\na very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch\\nand mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise\\nand he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross\\nby the end of another week  it had been a great disappointment\\nto mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed\\nso impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth\\nunder his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest\\nand best in his cellars  but a week must pass only a week\\nin annes reckoning and then she supposed they must meet\\nand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week\\n\\ncaptain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgroves civility\\nand she was all but calling there in the same half hour\\nshe and mary were actually setting forward for the great house\\nwhere as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him\\nwhen they were stopped by the eldest boys being at that moment\\nbrought home in consequence of a bad fall  the childs situation\\nput the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape\\nwith indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety\\nwhich they afterwards felt on his account\\n\\nhis collarbone was found to be dislocated and such injury\\nreceived in the back as roused the most alarming ideas\\nit was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once\\nthe apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed\\nthe mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control\\nthe youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend\\nand soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it\\nproper notice to the other house which brought her an accession\\nrather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants\\n\\nher brothers return was the first comfort he could take best care\\nof his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary\\ntill he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were\\nthe worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where\\nbut now the collarbone was soon replaced and though mr robinson\\nfelt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words\\nboth to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best\\nand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind\\nand then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts\\nwere able so far to digress from their nephews state as to give\\nthe information of captain wentworths visit staying five minutes behind\\ntheir father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted\\nthey were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable\\nthey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance\\nwho had been at all a favourite before  how glad they had been\\nto hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said\\nit was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised\\nin reply to papa and mammas farther pressing invitations to come\\nand dine with them on the morrowactually on the morrow\\nand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt\\nall the motive of their attention just as he ought  and in short\\nhe had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace\\nthat they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him\\nand off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently\\nmore full of captain wentworth than of little charles\\n\\nthe same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came\\nwith their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries\\nand mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir\\ncould add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now\\nno occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think\\nthat the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy\\nto give him the meeting  oh no as to leaving the little boy\\nboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm\\nto bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape\\ncould not help adding her warm protestations to theirs\\n\\ncharles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination\\nthe child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced\\nto captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening\\nhe would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour\\nbut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed\\ncharles i cannot bear to have you go away  only think if anything\\nshould happen\\n\\nthe child had a good night and was going on well the next day\\nit must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been\\ndone to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm\\nand charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity\\nfor longer confinement  the child was to be kept in bed and amused\\nas quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do\\nthis was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him\\nwho could be of no use at home to shut himself up  his father\\nvery much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being\\nno sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his\\nmaking a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting\\nof his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house\\n\\nnothing can be going on better than the child said he\\nso i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me\\nquite right  your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all\\nyou would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use\\nanne will send for me if anything is the matter\\n\\nhusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain\\nmary knew from charless manner of speaking that he was\\nquite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him\\nshe said nothing therefore till he was out of the room\\nbut as soon as there was only anne to hear\\n\\nso you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this\\npoor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening\\ni knew how it would be  this is always my luck  if there is\\nanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it\\nand charles is as bad as any of them  very unfeeling  i must say\\nit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy\\ntalks of his being going on so well  how does he know that he is\\ngoing on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence\\ni did not think charles would have been so unfeeling  so here he is to\\ngo away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother\\ni am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit\\nthan anybody else to be about the child  my being the mother\\nis the very reason why my feelings should not be tried  i am not at all\\nequal to it  you saw how hysterical i was yesterday\\n\\nbut that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm\\nof the shock  you will not be hysterical again  i dare say we shall have\\nnothing to distress us  i perfectly understand mr robinsons directions\\nand have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband\\nnursing does not belong to a man it is not his province\\na sick child is always the mothers property  her own feelings\\ngenerally make it so\\n\\ni hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know\\nthat i am of any more use in the sickroom than charles\\nfor i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill\\nand you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet\\nhe was sure to begin kicking about  i have not nerves\\nfor the sort of thing\\n\\nbut could you be comfortable yourself to be spending\\nthe whole evening away from the poor boy\\n\\nyes you see his papa can and why should not i  jemima is so careful\\nand she could send us word every hour how he was  i really think\\ncharles might as well have told his father we would all come\\ni am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is\\ni was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different today\\n\\nwell if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself\\nsuppose you were to go as well as your husband  leave little charles\\nto my care  mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain\\nwith him\\n\\nare you serious cried mary her eyes brightening  dear me\\nthats a very good thought very good indeed  to be sure\\ni may just as well go as not for i am of no use at homeam i\\nand it only harasses me  you who have not a mothers feelings\\nare a great deal the properest person  you can make little charles\\ndo anything he always minds you at a word  it will be a great deal better\\nthan leaving him only with jemima  oh i shall certainly go\\ni am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me\\nexcessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know\\nyou do not mind being left alone  an excellent thought of yours\\nindeed anne  i will go and tell charles and get ready directly\\nyou can send for us you know at a moments notice if anything\\nis the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you\\ni should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease\\nabout my dear child\\n\\nthe next moment she was tapping at her husbands dressingroom door\\nand as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for\\nthe whole conversation which began with marys saying\\nin a tone of great exultation\\n\\ni mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home\\nthan you are  if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child\\ni should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like\\nanne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him\\nit is annes own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be\\na great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday\\n\\nthis is very kind of anne was her husbands answer and i should be\\nvery glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be\\nleft at home by herself to nurse our sick child\\n\\nanne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity\\nof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction\\nwas at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being\\nleft to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening\\nwhen the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her\\nto let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable\\nand this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them\\nset off together in high spirits  they were gone she hoped\\nto be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem\\nas for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort\\nas were perhaps ever likely to be hers  she knew herself to be\\nof the first utility to the child and what was it to her\\nif frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself\\nagreeable to others\\n\\nshe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting\\nperhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances\\nhe must be either indifferent or unwilling  had he wished\\never to see her again he need not have waited till this time\\nhe would have done what she could not but believe that in his place\\nshe should have done long ago when events had been early giving him\\nthe independence which alone had been wanting\\n\\nher brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance\\nand their visit in general  there had been music singing\\ntalking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners\\nin captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all\\nto know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning\\nto shoot with charles  he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage\\nthough that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed\\nto come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being\\nin mrs charles musgroves way on account of the child and therefore\\nsomehow they hardly knew how it ended in charless being to meet him\\nto breakfast at his fathers\\n\\nanne understood it  he wished to avoid seeing her  he had inquired\\nafter her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance\\nseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps\\nby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet\\n\\nthe morning hours of the cottage were always later than those\\nof the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great\\nthat mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when\\ncharles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was\\ncome for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth\\nhis sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth\\nproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient\\nand though charles had answered for the childs being in no such state\\nas could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied\\nwithout his running on to give notice\\n\\nmary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him\\nwhile a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was\\nthe most consoling that it would soon be over  and it was soon over\\nin two minutes after charless preparation the others appeared\\nthey were in the drawingroom  her eye half met captain wentworths\\na bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary\\nsaid all that was right said something to the miss musgroves\\nenough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons\\nand voices but a few minutes ended it  charles shewed himself\\nat the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone\\nthe miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk\\nto the end of the village with the sportsmen  the room was cleared\\nand anne might finish her breakfast as she could\\n\\nit is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again\\nin nervous gratitude  the worst is over\\n\\nmary talked but she could not attend  she had seen him\\nthey had met  they had been once more in the same room\\n\\nsoon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less\\neight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up\\nhow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval\\nhad banished into distance and indistinctness  what might not\\neight years do  events of every description changes alienations\\nremovalsall all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past\\nhow natural how certain too  it included nearly a third part\\nof her own life\\n\\nalas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings\\neight years may be little more than nothing\\n\\nnow how were his sentiments to be read  was this like\\nwishing to avoid her  and the next moment she was hating herself\\nfor the folly which asked the question\\n\\non one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom\\nmight not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense\\nfor after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit\\nat the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary \\n\\ncaptain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was\\nso attentive to me  henrietta asked him what he thought of you\\nwhen they went away and he said you were so altered he should not\\nhave known you again\\n\\nmary had no feelings to make her respect her sisters in a common way\\nbut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound\\n\\naltered beyond his knowledge  anne fully submitted in silent\\ndeep mortification  doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge\\nfor he was not altered or not for the worse  she had already\\nacknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently\\nlet him think of her as he would  no  the years which had destroyed\\nher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly\\nopen look in no respect lessening his personal advantages\\nshe had seen the same frederick wentworth\\n\\nso altered that he should not have known her again  these were words\\nwhich could not but dwell with her  yet she soon began to rejoice\\nthat she had heard them  they were of sobering tendency\\nthey allayed agitation they composed and consequently must\\nmake her happier\\n\\nfrederick wentworth had used such words or something like them\\nbut without an idea that they would be carried round to her\\nhe had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal\\nhad spoken as he felt  he had not forgiven anne elliot\\nshe had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse\\nshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided\\nconfident temper could not endure  she had given him up to oblige others\\nit had been the effect of overpersuasion  it had been\\nweakness and timidity\\n\\nhe had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since\\nwhom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation\\nof curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again  her power with him\\nwas gone for ever\\n\\nit was now his object to marry  he was rich and being turned on shore\\nfully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted\\nactually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed\\nwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow  he had a heart\\nfor either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart\\nin short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way\\nexcepting anne elliot  this was his only secret exception\\nwhen he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions\\n\\nyes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match\\nanybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking\\na little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy\\nand i am a lost man  should not this be enough for a sailor\\nwho has had no society among women to make him nice\\n\\nhe said it she knew to be contradicted  his bright proud eye\\nspoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was\\nnot out of his thoughts when he more seriously described\\nthe woman he should wish to meet with  a strong mind\\nwith sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description\\n\\nthat is the woman i want said he  something a little inferior\\ni shall of course put up with but it must not be much  if i am a fool\\ni shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject\\nmore than most men\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 8\\n\\n\\nfrom this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly\\nin the same circle  they were soon dining in company together\\nat mr musgroves for the little boys state could no longer\\nsupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was\\nbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetings\\n\\nwhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof\\nformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each\\nthey could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement\\ncould not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions\\nwhich conversation called forth  his profession qualified him\\nhis disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year six\\nthat happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred\\nin the course of the first evening they spent together\\nand though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason\\nto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke\\nanne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind\\nthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself\\nthere must be the same immediate association of thought\\nthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain\\n\\nthey had no conversation together no intercourse but what\\nthe commonest civility required  once so much to each other\\nnow nothing  there had been a time when of all the large party\\nnow filling the drawingroom at uppercross they would have found it\\nmost difficult to cease to speak to one another  with the exception\\nperhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached\\nand happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among\\nthe married couples there could have been no two hearts so open\\nno tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved\\nnow they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could\\nnever become acquainted  it was a perpetual estrangement\\n\\nwhen he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind\\nthere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party\\nand he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves\\nwho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner\\nof living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise\\nat his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement\\nwhich was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule\\nwhich reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant\\nand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board\\nwithout anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were\\nor any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use\\n\\nfrom thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper\\nof mrs musgroves who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying\\n\\nah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son\\ni dare say he would have been just such another by this time\\n\\nanne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove\\nrelieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore\\ncould not keep pace with the conversation of the others\\n\\nwhen she could let her attention take its natural course again\\nshe found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list\\ntheir own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross\\nand sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view\\nof finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded\\n\\nyour first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp\\n\\nyou will not find her there  quite worn out and broken up\\ni was the last man who commanded her  hardly fit for service then\\nreported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off\\nto the west indies\\n\\nthe girls looked all amazement\\n\\nthe admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then\\nwith sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed\\nbut they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands\\nthat may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible\\nfor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed\\n\\nphoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk\\nnever was a better sloop than the asp in her day  for an old built sloop\\nyou would not see her equal  lucky fellow to get her  he knows there\\nmust have been twenty better men than himself applying for her\\nat the same time  lucky fellow to get anything so soon\\nwith no more interest than his\\n\\ni felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth\\nseriously  i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire\\nit was a great object with me at that time to be at sea\\na very great object i wanted to be doing something\\n\\nto be sure you did  what should a young fellow like you do ashore\\nfor half a year together  if a man had not a wife he soon wants\\nto be afloat again\\n\\nbut captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been\\nwhen you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you\\n\\ni knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling\\ni had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to\\nthe fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen\\nlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember\\nand which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself\\nah she was a dear old asp to me  she did all that i wanted\\ni knew she would  i knew that we should either go to the bottom together\\nor that she would be the making of me and i never had two days\\nof foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after\\ntaking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck\\nin my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate\\ni wanted  i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck\\nwe had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on\\nwhich lasted four days and nights and which would have done for\\npoor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation\\nnot having much improved our condition  fourandtwenty hours later\\nand i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth\\nin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost\\nin only a sloop nobody would have thought about me annes shudderings\\nwere to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open\\nas they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror\\n\\nand so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice\\nas if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there\\nhe met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her\\ndo ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother\\ni always forgot\\n\\nit was at gibraltar mother i know  dick had been left ill at gibraltar\\nwith a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth\\n\\noh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid\\nof mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure\\nto hear him talked of by such a good friend\\n\\ncharles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case\\nonly nodded in reply and walked away\\n\\nthe girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth\\ncould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume\\ninto his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud\\nthe little statement of her name and rate and present\\nnoncommissioned class observing over it that she too had been\\none of the best friends man ever had\\n\\nah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia  how fast i\\nmade money in her  a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise\\ntogether off the western islands  poor harville sister\\nyou know how much he wanted money  worse than myself  he had a wife\\nexcellent fellow  i shall never forget his happiness  he felt it all\\nso much for her sake  i wished for him again the next summer\\nwhen i had still the same luck in the mediterranean\\n\\nand i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us\\nwhen you were put captain into that ship  we shall never forget\\nwhat you did\\n\\nher feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth\\nhearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all\\nnear his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more\\n\\nmy brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking\\nof poor richard\\n\\npoor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady\\nand such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care\\nah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you\\ni assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you\\n\\nthere was a momentary expression in captain wentworths face at this speech\\na certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth\\nwhich convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgroves kind wishes\\nas to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him\\nbut it was too transient an indulgence of selfamusement to be detected\\nby any who understood him less than herself in another moment\\nhe was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards\\ncoming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting\\ntook a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her\\nin a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy\\nand natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all\\nthat was real and unabsurd in the parents feelings\\n\\nthey were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had\\nmost readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove\\nit was no insignificant barrier indeed  mrs musgrove was of\\na comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature\\nto express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment\\nand while the agitations of annes slender form and pensive face\\nmay be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth\\nshould be allowed some credit for the selfcommand with which\\nhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son\\nwhom alive nobody had cared for\\n\\npersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions\\na large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction\\nas the most graceful set of limbs in the world  but fair or not fair\\nthere are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain\\nwhich taste cannot toleratewhich ridicule will seize\\n\\nthe admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room\\nwith his hands behind him being called to order by his wife\\nnow came up to captain wentworth and without any observation\\nof what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts\\nbegan with\\n\\nif you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick\\nyou would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson\\nand her daughters\\n\\nshould i  i am glad i was not a week later then\\n\\nthe admiral abused him for his want of gallantry  he defended himself\\nthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies\\non board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit\\nwhich a few hours might comprehend\\n\\nbut if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry\\ntowards them  it is rather from feeling how impossible it is\\nwith all ones efforts and all ones sacrifices to make\\nthe accommodations on board such as women ought to have\\nthere can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women\\nto every personal comfort high and this is what i do  i hate to hear\\nof women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command\\nshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it\\n\\nthis brought his sister upon him\\n\\noh frederick  but i cannot believe it of you all idle refinement\\nwomen may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england\\ni believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know\\nnothing superior to the accommodations of a manofwar  i declare\\ni have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall\\nwith a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of\\nthe ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether\\n\\nnothing to the purpose replied her brother  you were living\\nwith your husband and were the only woman on board\\n\\nbut you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin\\nand three children round from portsmouth to plymouth  where was this\\nsuperfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then\\n\\nall merged in my friendship sophia  i would assist any\\nbrother officers wife that i could and i would bring anything\\nof harvilles from the worlds end if he wanted it  but do not imagine\\nthat i did not feel it an evil in itself\\n\\ndepend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable\\n\\ni might not like them the better for that perhaps  such a number\\nof women and children have no right to be comfortable on board\\n\\nmy dear frederick you are talking quite idly  pray what would\\nbecome of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to\\none port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings\\n\\nmy feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville\\nand all her family to plymouth\\n\\nbut i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman\\nand as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures\\nwe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days\\n\\nah my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife\\nhe will sing a different tune  when he is married if we have\\nthe good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i\\nand a great many others have done  we shall have him very thankful\\nto anybody that will bring him his wife\\n\\nay that we shall\\n\\nnow i have done cried captain wentworth  when once married\\npeople begin to attack me withoh you will think very differently\\nwhen you are married  i can only say no i shall not and then\\nthey say again yes you will and there is an end of it\\n\\nhe got up and moved away\\n\\nwhat a great traveller you must have been maam said mrs musgrove\\nto mrs croft\\n\\npretty well maam in the fifteen years of my marriage\\nthough many women have done more  i have crossed the atlantic\\nfour times and have been once to the east indies and back again\\nand only once besides being in different places about home\\ncork and lisbon and gibraltar  but i never went beyond the streights\\nand never was in the west indies  we do not call bermuda or bahama\\nyou know the west indies\\n\\nmrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself\\nof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life\\n\\nand i do assure you maam pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed\\nthe accommodations of a manofwar i speak you know of the higher rates\\nwhen you come to a frigate of course you are more confined\\nthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them\\nand i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent\\non board a ship  while we were together you know there was nothing\\nto be feared  thank god  i have always been blessed with\\nexcellent health and no climate disagrees with me  a little disordered\\nalways the first twentyfour hours of going to sea but never knew\\nwhat sickness was afterwards  the only time i ever really suffered\\nin body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell\\nor had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal\\nwhen the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas\\ni lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of\\nimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself\\nor when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together\\nnothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience\\n\\naye to be sure  yes indeed oh yes  i am quite of your opinion\\nmrs croft was mrs musgroves hearty answer  there is nothing so bad\\nas a separation  i am quite of your opinion  i know what it is\\nfor mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when\\nthey are over and he is safe back again\\n\\nthe evening ended with dancing  on its being proposed\\nanne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes\\nfill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad\\nto be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved\\n\\nit was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits\\nthan captain wentworth  she felt that he had every thing to elevate\\nhim which general attention and deference and especially the attention\\nof all the young women could do  the miss hayters the females\\nof the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted\\nto the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa\\nthey both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but\\nthe continued appearance of the most perfect goodwill between themselves\\ncould have made it credible that they were not decided rivals\\nif he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration\\nwho could wonder\\n\\nthese were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers\\nwere mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together\\nequally without error and without consciousness  once she felt\\nthat he was looking at herself  observing her altered features\\nperhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once\\ncharmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her\\nshe was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was\\nsure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced\\nthe answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing\\nshe had rather play  she is never tired of playing  once too\\nhe spoke to her  she had left the instrument on the dancing being over\\nand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished\\nto give the miss musgroves an idea of  unintentionally she returned\\nto that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising\\nsaid with studied politeness\\n\\ni beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately\\ndrew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced\\nto sit down again\\n\\nanne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches\\nhis cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 9\\n\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay\\nas long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of\\nthe admirals fraternal kindness as of his wifes  he had intended\\non first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire\\nand visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions\\nof uppercross induced him to put this off  there was so much\\nof friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching\\nin his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable\\nthat he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all\\nthe charms and perfections of edwards wife upon credit a little longer\\n\\nit was soon uppercross with him almost every day  the musgroves\\ncould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly\\nin the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral\\nand mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves\\nin their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about\\nin a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig\\nlately added to their establishment\\n\\nhitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth\\namong the musgroves and their dependencies  it was unvarying\\nwarm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more\\nthan established when a certain charles hayter returned among them\\nto be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth\\nvery much in the way\\n\\ncharles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable\\npleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been\\na considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworths\\nintroduction  he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood\\nwhere residence was not required lived at his fathers house\\nonly two miles from uppercross  a short absence from home\\nhad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period\\nand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners\\nand of seeing captain wentworth\\n\\nmrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters  they had each had money\\nbut their marriages had made a material difference in\\ntheir degree of consequence  mr hayter had some property of his own\\nbut it was insignificant compared with mr musgroves and while\\nthe musgroves were in the first class of society in the country\\nthe young hayters would from their parents inferior retired\\nand unpolished way of living and their own defective education\\nhave been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion\\nwith uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen\\nto be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior\\nin cultivation and manners to all the rest\\n\\nthe two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride\\non one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness\\nof superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleased\\nto improve their cousins  charless attentions to henrietta\\nhad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation\\nit would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked him\\nand henrietta did seem to like him\\n\\nhenrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came\\nbut from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten\\n\\nwhich of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was\\nas yet quite doubtful as far as annes observation reached\\nhenrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits\\nand she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character\\nwere most likely to attract him\\n\\nmr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from\\nan entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters\\nand of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything\\nto take its chance  there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude\\nor remark about them in the mansionhouse but it was different\\nat the cottage  the young couple there were more disposed\\nto speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been above\\nfour or five times in the miss musgroves company and charles hayter\\nhad but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions\\nof her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best\\ncharles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing\\nthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightful\\n\\ncharles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what\\nhe had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that\\nhe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war\\nhere was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance\\nof what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworth\\nwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy\\noh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters\\n\\nupon my word it would replied mary  dear me  if he should\\nrise to any very great honours  if he should ever be made a baronet\\nlady wentworth sounds very well  that would be a noble thing\\nindeed for henrietta  she would take place of me then and henrietta\\nwould not dislike that  sir frederick and lady wentworth\\nit would be but a new creation however and i never think much\\nof your new creations\\n\\nit suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred\\non the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished\\nto see put an end to  she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters\\nand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection\\nbetween the families renewedvery sad for herself and her children\\n\\nyou know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta\\nand considering the alliances which the musgroves have made\\nshe has no right to throw herself away  i do not think any young woman\\nhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient\\nto the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections\\nto those who have not been used to them  and pray who is charles hayter\\nnothing but a country curate  a most improper match for miss musgrove\\nof uppercross\\n\\nher husband however would not agree with her here for besides having\\na regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son\\nand he saw things as an eldest son himself\\n\\nnow you are taking nonsense mary was therefore his answer\\nit would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has\\na very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from\\nthe bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember\\nthat he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very\\npretty property  the estate at winthrop is not less than\\ntwo hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton\\nwhich is some of the best land in the country  i grant you\\nthat any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta\\nand indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible\\nbut he is a very goodnatured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop\\ncomes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it\\nand live in a very different sort of way and with that property\\nhe will never be a contemptible mangood freehold property  no no\\nhenrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him\\nand louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied\\n\\ncharles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as\\nhe was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta\\nmarry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse\\nfor me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth\\nmay soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt\\nthat he has  she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday\\ni wish you had been there to see her behaviour  and as to\\ncaptain wentworths liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense\\nto say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best\\nbut charles is so positive  i wish you had been with us yesterday\\nfor then you might have decided between us and i am sure you\\nwould have thought as i did unless you had been determined\\nto give it against me\\n\\na dinner at mr musgroves had been the occasion when all these things\\nshould have been seen by anne but she had staid at home\\nunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return\\nof indisposition in little charles  she had thought only of avoiding\\ncaptain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire\\nwas now added to the advantages of a quiet evening\\n\\nas to captain wentworths views she deemed it of more consequence\\nthat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering\\nthe happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour\\nthan that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta\\neither of them would in all probability make him an affectionate\\ngoodhumoured wife  with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy\\nwhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a wellmeaning\\nyoung woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings\\nit occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature\\nof her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon\\n\\ncharles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him\\nin his cousins behaviour  she had too old a regard for him\\nto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish\\nevery past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away\\nfrom uppercross  but there was such a change as became very alarming\\nwhen such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as\\nthe probable cause  he had been absent only two sundays\\nand when they parted had left her interested even to the height\\nof his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy\\nand obtaining that of uppercross instead  it had then seemed the object\\nnearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than\\nforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office\\nbut was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed\\non engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good\\nas he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it\\nthe advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going\\nsix miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy\\nof his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirleys\\nbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through\\nwithout most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa\\nbut had been almost everything to henrietta  when he came back alas\\nthe zeal of the business was gone by  louisa could not listen at all\\nto his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley\\nshe was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta\\nhad at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten\\nall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation\\n\\nwell i am very glad indeed  but i always thought you would have it\\ni always thought you sure  it did not appear to me thatin short\\nyou know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise\\nis he coming louisa\\n\\none morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves\\nat which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into\\nthe drawingroom at the cottage where were only herself and the little\\ninvalid charles who was lying on the sofa\\n\\nthe surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot\\ndeprived his manners of their usual composure  he started\\nand could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here\\nmrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked\\nto the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave\\n\\nthey are up stairs with my sister  they will be down in a few moments\\ni dare say had been annes reply in all the confusion that was natural\\nand if the child had not called her to come and do something for him\\nshe would have been out of the room the next moment and released\\ncaptain wentworth as well as herself\\n\\nhe continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying\\ni hope the little boy is better was silent\\n\\nshe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there\\nto satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes\\nwhen to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person\\ncrossing the little vestibule  she hoped on turning her head\\nto see the master of the house but it proved to be one\\nmuch less calculated for making matters easycharles hayter\\nprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth\\nthan captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne\\n\\nshe only attempted to say how do you do  will you not sit down\\nthe others will be here presently\\n\\ncaptain wentworth however came from his window apparently\\nnot illdisposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end\\nto his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up\\nthe newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window\\n\\nanother minute brought another addition  the younger boy\\na remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door\\nopened for him by some one without made his determined appearance\\namong them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on\\nand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away\\n\\nthere being nothing to eat he could only have some play\\nand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother\\nhe began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that\\nbusy as she was about charles she could not shake him off\\nshe spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain\\nonce she did contrive to push him away but the boy had\\nthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly\\n\\nwalter said she get down this moment  you are extremely troublesome\\ni am very angry with you\\n\\nwalter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid\\ndo not you hear your aunt speak  come to me walter come to\\ncousin charles\\n\\nbut not a bit did walter stir\\n\\nin another moment however she found herself in the state of\\nbeing released from him some one was taking him from her\\nthough he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands\\nwere unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away\\nbefore she knew that captain wentworth had done it\\n\\nher sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless\\nshe could not even thank him  she could only hang over little charles\\nwith most disordered feelings  his kindness in stepping forward\\nto her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed\\nthe little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon\\nforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child\\nthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought\\nto testify that her conversation was the last of his wants\\nproduced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation\\nas she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary\\nand the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares\\nand leave the room  she could not stay  it might have been\\nan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four\\nthey were now altogether but she could stay for none of it\\nit was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards\\ncaptain wentworth  she had a strong impression of his having said\\nin a vext tone of voice after captain wentworths interference\\nyou ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt\\nand could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do\\nwhat he ought to have done himself  but neither charles hayters feelings\\nnor anybodys feelings could interest her till she had a little better\\narranged her own  she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed\\nof being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was\\nand it required a long application of solitude and reflection\\nto recover her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 10\\n\\n\\nother opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur\\nanne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough\\nto have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home\\nwhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife\\nfor while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite\\nshe could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory\\nand experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either\\nthey were more in love with him yet there it was not love\\nit was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must\\nend in love with some  charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted\\nand yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them\\nanne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about\\nand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to\\nshe did not attribute guile to any  it was the highest satisfaction\\nto her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware\\nof the pain he was occasioning  there was no triumph no pitiful triumph\\nin his manner  he had probably never heard and never thought of\\nany claims of charles hayter  he was only wrong in accepting\\nthe attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once\\n\\nafter a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field\\nthree days had passed without his coming once to uppercross\\na most decided change  he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner\\nand having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books\\nbefore him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right\\nand talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death\\nit was marys hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal\\nfrom henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence\\nof seeing him tomorrow  anne could only feel that charles hayter\\nwas wise\\n\\none morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth\\nbeing gone ashooting together as the sisters in the cottage\\nwere sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window\\nby the sisters from the mansionhouse\\n\\nit was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came\\nthrough the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say\\nthat they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded\\nmary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied\\nwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes\\ni should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk\\nanne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely\\nwhat they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity\\nwhich the family habits seemed to produce of everything being\\nto be communicated and everything being to be done together\\nhowever undesired and inconvenient  she tried to dissuade mary from going\\nbut in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept\\nthe miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise\\nas she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening\\nthe interference in any plan of their own\\n\\ni cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk\\nsaid mary as she went up stairs  everybody is always supposing\\nthat i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased\\nif we had refused to join them  when people come in this manner\\non purpose to ask us how can one say no\\n\\njust as they were setting off the gentlemen returned  they had taken out\\na young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early\\ntheir time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready\\nfor this walk and they entered into it with pleasure  could anne\\nhave foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but\\nfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was\\ntoo late to retract and the whole six set forward together\\nin the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently\\nconsidered the walk as under their guidance\\n\\nannes object was not to be in the way of anybody and where\\nthe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary\\nto keep with her brother and sister  her pleasure in the walk\\nmust arise from the exercise and the day from the view of\\nthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges\\nand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical\\ndescriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and\\ninexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness\\nthat season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read\\nsome attempt at description or some lines of feeling\\nshe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings\\nand quotations but it was not possible that when within reach\\nof captain wentworths conversation with either of the miss musgroves\\nshe should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable\\nit was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing\\nmight fall into  he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta\\nlouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister\\nthis distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech\\nof louisas which struck her  after one of the many praises of the day\\nwhich were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added \\n\\nwhat glorious weather for the admiral and my sister  they meant to take\\na long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from\\nsome of these hills  they talked of coming into this side of the country\\ni wonder whereabouts they will upset today  oh it does happen\\nvery often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it\\nshe would as lieve be tossed out as not\\n\\nah you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were\\nreally so i should do just the same in her place  if i loved a man\\nas she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever\\nseparate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely\\nby anybody else\\n\\nit was spoken with enthusiasm\\n\\nhad you cried he catching the same tone i honour you\\nand there was silence between them for a little while\\n\\nanne could not immediately fall into a quotation again  the sweet scenes\\nof autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet\\nfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining\\nhappiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together\\nblessed her memory  she roused herself to say as they struck by order\\ninto another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop\\nbut nobody heard or at least nobody answered her\\n\\nwinthrop however or its environsfor young men are sometimes\\nto be met with strolling about near homewas their destination\\nand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures\\nwhere the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer\\ncounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning\\nto have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill\\nwhich parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view\\nof the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side\\n\\nwinthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them\\nan indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and\\nbuildings of a farmyard\\n\\nmary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop  i declare i had no idea\\nwell now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired\\n\\nhenrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles\\nwalking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready\\nto do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no\\ncried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be\\narguing the matter warmly\\n\\ncharles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution\\nof calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently\\nthough more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too\\nbut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength\\nand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter\\nof an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered\\noh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm\\nthan any sitting down could do her good and in short\\nher look and manner declared that go she would not\\n\\nafter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations\\nit was settled between charles and his two sisters that he\\nand henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt\\nand cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top\\nof the hill  louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan\\nand as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking\\nto henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her\\nand saying to captain wentworth\\n\\nit is very unpleasant having such connexions  but i assure you\\ni have never been in the house above twice in my life\\n\\nshe received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile\\nfollowed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne\\nperfectly knew the meaning of\\n\\nthe brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot\\nlouisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself\\non the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others\\nall stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away\\nto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedgerow\\nand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound\\nmary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat\\nwas sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could\\nprevent her from going to look for a better also  she turned through\\nthe same gate but could not see them  anne found a nice seat\\nfor her on a dry sunny bank under the hedgerow in which\\nshe had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other\\nmary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa\\nhad found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on\\ntill she overtook her\\n\\nanne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard\\ncaptain wentworth and louisa in the hedgerow behind her as if\\nmaking their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the\\ncentre  they were speaking as they drew near  louisas voice was\\nthe first distinguished  she seemed to be in the middle of some\\neager speech  what anne first heard was\\n\\nand so i made her go  i could not bear that she should be frightened\\nfrom the visit by such nonsense  what would i be turned back from\\ndoing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right\\nby the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say\\nno i have no idea of being so easily persuaded  when i have\\nmade up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely\\nto have made up hers to call at winthrop today and yet she was as near\\ngiving it up out of nonsensical complaisance\\n\\nshe would have turned back then but for you\\n\\nshe would indeed  i am almost ashamed to say it\\n\\nhappy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand  after the hints\\nyou gave just now which did but confirm my own observations\\nthe last time i was in company with him  i need not affect\\nto have no comprehension of what is going on  i see that more than\\na mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question\\nand woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence\\nwhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and\\nstrength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist\\nidle interference in such a trifle as this  your sister is\\nan amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness\\ni see  if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much\\nof your own spirit into her as you can  but this no doubt\\nyou have been always doing  it is the worst evil of too yielding\\nand indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on\\nyou are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody\\nmay sway it  let those who would be happy be firm  here is a nut\\nsaid he catching one down from an upper bough  to exemplify\\na beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength\\nhas outlived all the storms of autumn  not a puncture not\\na weak spot anywhere  this nut he continued with playful solemnity\\nwhile so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot\\nis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be\\nsupposed capable of  then returning to his former earnest tone\\nmy first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm\\nif louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life\\nshe will cherish all her present powers of mind\\n\\nhe had done and was unanswered  it would have surprised anne if louisa\\ncould have readily answered such a speech  words of such interest\\nspoken with such serious warmth  she could imagine what louisa was feeling\\nfor herself she feared to move lest she should be seen\\nwhile she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her\\nand they were moving on  before they were beyond her hearing\\nhowever louisa spoke again\\n\\nmary is goodnatured enough in many respects said she\\nbut she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense\\nand pridethe elliot pride  she has a great deal too much\\nof the elliot pride  we do so wish that charles had married anne instead\\ni suppose you know he wanted to marry anne\\n\\nafter a moments pause captain wentworth said\\n\\ndo you mean that she refused him\\n\\noh yes certainly\\n\\nwhen did that happen\\n\\ni do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time\\nbut i believe about a year before he married mary  i wish she had\\naccepted him  we should all have liked her a great deal better\\nand papa and mamma always think it was her great friend\\nlady russells doing that she did not  they think charles\\nmight not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell\\nand that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him\\n\\nthe sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more\\nher own emotions still kept her fixed  she had much to recover from\\nbefore she could move  the listeners proverbial fate was\\nnot absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard\\na great deal of very painful import  she saw how her own character\\nwas considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree\\nof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her\\nextreme agitation\\n\\nas soon as she could she went after mary and having found\\nand walked back with her to their former station by the stile\\nfelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards\\ncollected and once more in motion together  her spirits wanted\\nthe solitude and silence which only numbers could give\\n\\ncharles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured\\ncharles hayter with them  the minutiae of the business anne\\ncould not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem\\nadmitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing\\non the gentlemans side and a relenting on the ladys and that they\\nwere now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt\\nhenrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased\\ncharles hayter exceedingly happy  and they were devoted to each other\\nalmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross\\n\\neverything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth\\nnothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary\\nor even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much\\nas the other two  in a long strip of meadow land where there was\\nample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties\\nand to that party of the three which boasted least animation\\nand least complaisance anne necessarily belonged  she joined charles\\nand mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charless other arm\\nbut charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper\\nwith his wife  mary had shewn herself disobliging to him\\nand was now to reap the consequence which consequence was\\nhis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads\\nof some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary began\\nto complain of it and lament her being illused according to custom\\nin being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other\\nhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had\\na momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all\\n\\nthis long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it\\nwas to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit\\nthe carriage advancing in the same direction which had been\\nsome time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral crofts gig\\nhe and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home\\nupon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in\\nthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired\\nit would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross\\nthe invitation was general and generally declined  the miss musgroves\\nwere not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked\\nbefore any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride\\ncould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise\\n\\nthe walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an\\nopposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again\\nwhen captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something\\nto his sister  the something might be guessed by its effects\\n\\nmiss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft\\ndo let us have the pleasure of taking you home  here is excellent room\\nfor three i assure you  if we were all like you i believe we might\\nsit four  you must indeed you must\\n\\nanne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline\\nshe was not allowed to proceed  the admirals kind urgency\\ncame in support of his wifes they would not be refused\\nthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible space\\nto leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word\\nturned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage\\n\\nyes he had done it  she was in the carriage and felt that he had\\nplaced her there that his will and his hands had done it\\nthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution\\nto give her rest  she was very much affected by the view of\\nhis disposition towards her which all these things made apparent\\nthis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before\\nshe understood him  he could not forgive her but he could not\\nbe unfeeling  though condemning her for the past and considering it\\nwith high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her\\nand though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer\\nwithout the desire of giving her relief  it was a remainder\\nof former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged\\nfriendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart\\nwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded\\nof pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed\\n\\nher answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions\\nwere at first unconsciously given  they had travelled half their way\\nalong the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said\\nshe then found them talking of frederick\\n\\nhe certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy\\nsaid the admiral but there is no saying which  he has been\\nrunning after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind\\nay this comes of the peace  if it were war now he would have\\nsettled it long ago  we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make\\nlong courtships in time of war  how many days was it my dear\\nbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together\\nin our lodgings at north yarmouth\\n\\nwe had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly\\nfor if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding\\nshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy together\\ni had known you by character however long before\\n\\nwell and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we\\nto wait for besides  i do not like having such things so long in hand\\ni wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home\\none of these young ladies to kellynch  then there would always\\nbe company for them  and very nice young ladies they both are\\ni hardly know one from the other\\n\\nvery good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft\\nin a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that\\nher keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy\\nof her brother and a very respectable family  one could not be\\nconnected with better people  my dear admiral that post\\nwe shall certainly take that post\\n\\nbut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily\\npassed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out\\nher hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dungcart\\nand anne with some amusement at their style of driving\\nwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance\\nof their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 11\\n\\n\\nthe time now approached for lady russells return  the day was even fixed\\nand anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled\\nwas looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning\\nto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it\\n\\nit would place her in the same village with captain wentworth\\nwithin half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church\\nand there must be intercourse between the two families\\nthis was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time\\nat uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather\\nas leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole\\nshe believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer\\nalmost as certainly as in her change of domestic society\\nin leaving poor mary for lady russell\\n\\nshe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing\\ncaptain wentworth at the hall  those rooms had witnessed\\nformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before her\\nbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and\\ncaptain wentworth never meeting anywhere  they did not like each other\\nand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell\\nto see them together she might think that he had too much selfpossession\\nand she too little\\n\\nthese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating\\nher removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed\\nquite long enough  her usefulness to little charles would always\\ngive some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there\\nbut he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for\\n\\nthe conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way\\nwhich she had not at all imagined  captain wentworth after being unseen\\nand unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them\\nto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away\\n\\na letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last\\nhad brought intelligence of captain harvilles being settled\\nwith his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore\\nquite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other  captain harville\\nhad never been in good health since a severe wound which he received\\ntwo years before and captain wentworths anxiety to see him\\nhad determined him to go immediately to lyme  he had been there\\nfor fourandtwenty hours  his acquittal was complete\\nhis friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend\\nand his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to\\nby the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves\\nand a project for going thither was the consequence\\n\\nthe young people were all wild to see lyme  captain wentworth talked\\nof going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross\\nthough november the weather was by no means bad and in short\\nlouisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed\\nthe resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she

anne henrietta\\nlouisa and captain wentworth\\n\\nthe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night\\nbut to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent\\nand when it came to be rationally considered a day in\\nthe middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place\\nafter deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required\\nfor going and returning  they were consequently to stay the night there\\nand not to be expected back till the next days dinner  this was felt\\nto be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house\\nat rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually\\nit was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgroves coach\\ncontaining the four ladies and charless curricle in which\\nhe drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme\\nand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself\\nthat it was very evident they would not have more than time\\nfor looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone\\n\\nafter securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns\\nthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly\\ndown to the sea  they were come too late in the year for any amusement\\nor variety which lyme as a public place might offer  the rooms\\nwere shut up the

retired bay backed by dark cliffs\\nwhere fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot\\nfor watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation\\nthe woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all\\npinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where\\nthe scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth\\ndeclare that many

louisa\\nseemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long\\nwhen they saw him coming after them with three companions\\nall well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville\\nand a captain benwick who was staying with them\\n\\ncaptain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia\\nand the account which captain wentworth had given of him\\non his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as\\nan excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly\\nwhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener\\nhad been followed by a little history of his private life\\nwhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies\\nhe had been engaged to captain harvilles sister and was now\\nmourning her loss  they had been a year or two waiting for fortune\\nand promotion  fortune came his prizemoney as lieutenant being great\\npromotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it\\nshe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea  captain wentworth\\nbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to woman\\nthan poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply\\nafflicted under the dreadful change  he considered his disposition\\nas of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings\\nwith quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading\\nand sedentary pursuits  to finish the interest of the story\\nthe friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible\\naugmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance\\nand captain benwick was now living with them entirely  captain harville\\nhad taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health\\nand his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive\\nand by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement\\nof lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwicks\\nstate of mind  the sympathy and goodwill excited towards captain benwick\\nwas very great\\n\\nand yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward\\nto meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart\\nthan i have  i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever\\nhe is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact\\nyounger as a man  he will rally again and be happy with another\\n\\nthey all met and were introduced  captain harville was a tall\\ndark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame\\nand from strong features and want of health looking much older\\nthan captain wentworth  captain benwick looked and was\\nthe youngest of the three and compared with either of them\\na little man  he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air\\njust as he ought to have and drew back from conversation\\n\\ncaptain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners\\nwas a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging\\nmrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however\\nto have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant\\nthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own\\nbecause the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable\\nthan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them\\nthe dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly\\naccepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth\\nshould have brought any such party to lyme without considering it\\nas a thing of course that they should dine with them\\n\\nthere was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this\\nand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon\\nso unlike the usual style of giveandtake invitations and dinners\\nof formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be\\nbenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brotherofficers\\nthese would have been all my friends was her thought\\nand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness\\n\\non quitting the cobb they all went indoors with their new friends\\nand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart\\ncould think capable of accommodating so many  anne had\\na moments astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost\\nin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all\\nthe ingenious contrivances and

with his profession\\nthe fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits\\nthe picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented\\nmade it to her a something more or less than gratification\\n\\ncaptain harville was no reader but he had contrived\\nexcellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves\\nfor a tolerable collection of wellbound volumes the property of\\ncaptain benwick  his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise\\nbut a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with\\nconstant employment within  he drew he varnished he carpentered\\nhe glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new nettingneedles\\nand pins with improvements and if everything else was done\\nsat down to his large fishingnet at one corner of the room\\n\\nanne thought she left great happiness behind her when they\\nquitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking\\nburst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character\\nof the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness\\ntheir uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having\\nmore worth and warmth than any other set of men in england\\nthat they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be\\nrespected and loved\\n\\nthey went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme\\nanswered already that nothing was found amiss though its being\\nso entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme\\nand the no expectation of company had brought many apologies\\nfrom the heads of the inn\\n\\nanne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened\\nto being in captain wentworths company than she had at first imagined\\ncould ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now\\nand the interchange of the common civilities attending on it\\nthey never got beyond was become a mere nothing\\n\\nthe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow\\nbut captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening\\nand he came bringing his friend also which was more than\\nhad been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick\\nhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of\\nso many strangers  he ventured among them again however\\nthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth\\nof the party in general\\n\\nwhile captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room\\nand by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance\\nto occupy and entertain the others it fell to annes lot to be placed\\nrather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse\\nof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him\\nhe was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of\\nher countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect\\nand anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion\\nhe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading\\nthough principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having\\ngiven him at least an evenings indulgence in the discussion of subjects\\nwhich his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope\\nof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and\\nbenefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out\\nof their conversation  for though shy he did not seem reserved\\nit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their\\nusual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of\\nthe present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion\\nas to the firstrate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion\\nor the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour\\nand the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced\\nhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs\\nof the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony\\nof the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines\\nwhich imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness\\nand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood\\nthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry\\nand to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be\\nseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely\\nand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly\\nwere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly\\n\\nhis looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion\\nto his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself\\nthe right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend\\na larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested\\nto particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists\\nsuch collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters\\nof worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment\\nas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts\\nand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances\\n\\ncaptain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for\\nthe interest implied and though with a shake of the head\\nand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books\\non grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended\\nand promised to procure and read them\\n\\nwhen the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea\\nof her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man\\nwhom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing\\non more serious reflection that like many other great moralists\\nand preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct\\nwould ill bear examination\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 12\\n\\n\\nanne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party\\nthe next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast\\nthey went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide\\nwhich a fine southeasterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur\\nwhich so flat a shore admitted  they praised the morning\\ngloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the freshfeeling\\nbreezeand were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with\\n\\noh yesi am quite convinced that with very few exceptions\\nthe seaair always does good  there can be no doubt of its having been\\nof the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness\\nlast spring twelvemonth  he declares himself that coming to lyme\\nfor a month did him more good than all the medicine he took\\nand that being by the sea always makes him feel young again\\nnow i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live\\nentirely by the sea  i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely\\nand fix at lyme  do not you anne  do not you agree with me\\nthat it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley\\nshe has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would\\nmake it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad\\nto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand\\nin case of his having another seizure  indeed i think it quite melancholy\\nto have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been\\ndoing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place\\nlike uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out\\nfrom all the world  i wish his friends would propose it to him\\ni really think they ought  and as to procuring a dispensation\\nthere could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character\\nmy only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish\\nhe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions overscrupulous\\ni must say  do not you think anne it is being overscrupulous\\ndo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience\\nwhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties\\nwhich may be just as well performed by another person  and at lyme too\\nonly seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear\\nif people thought there was anything to complain of\\n\\nanne smiled more than once to herself during this speech\\nand entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into\\nthe feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good\\nof a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence\\nshe said all that was reasonable and proper on the business\\nfelt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very\\ndesirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man\\nas a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at\\nthe advantage of such resident curates being married\\n\\ni wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion\\ni wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate\\nwith dr shirley  i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of\\nthe greatest influence with everybody  i always look upon her as able\\nto persuade a person to anything  i am afraid of her as i have\\ntold you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever\\nbut i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour\\nat uppercross\\n\\nanne was amused by henriettas manner of being grateful\\nand amused also that the course of events and the new interests\\nof henriettas views should have placed her friend at all in favour\\nwith any of the musgrove family she had only time however\\nfor a general answer and a wish that such another woman\\nwere at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased\\non seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them\\nthey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready\\nbut louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something\\nto procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town\\nthey were all at her disposal\\n\\nwhen they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman\\nat the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back\\nand stopped to give them way  they ascended and passed him\\nand as they passed annes face caught his eye and he looked at her\\nwith a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of\\nshe was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features\\nhaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind\\nwhich had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye\\nwhich it had also produced  it was evident that the gentleman\\ncompletely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly\\ncaptain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which\\nshewed his noticing of it  he gave her a momentary glance\\na glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you\\nand even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again\\n\\nafter attending louisa through her business and loitering about\\na little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards\\nquickly from her own chamber to their diningroom had nearly run against\\nthe very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment\\nshe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves\\nand determined that a welllooking groom who was strolling about\\nnear the two inns as they came back should be his servant\\nboth master and man being in mourning assisted the idea\\nit was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves\\nand this second meeting short as it was also proved again\\nby the gentlemans looks that he thought hers very lovely\\nand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was\\na man of exceedingly good manners  he seemed about thirty\\nand though not handsome had an agreeable person  anne felt that\\nshe should like to know who he was\\n\\nthey had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage\\nalmost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party\\nto the window  it was a gentlemans carriage a curricle\\nbut only coming round from the stableyard to the front door\\nsomebody must be going away  it was driven by a servant in mourning\\n\\nthe word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might\\ncompare it with his own the servant in mourning roused annes curiosity\\nand the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner\\nof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows\\nand civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off\\n\\nah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne\\nit is the very man we passed\\n\\nthe miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him\\nas far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table\\nthe waiter came into the room soon afterwards\\n\\npray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name\\nof the gentleman who is just gone away\\n\\nyes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night\\nfrom sidmouth  dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were\\nat dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath\\nand london\\n\\nelliot  many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name\\nbefore all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity\\nof a waiter\\n\\nbless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot\\nit must indeed  charles anne must not it  in mourning you see\\njust as our mr elliot must be  how very extraordinary\\nin the very same inn with us  anne must not it be our mr elliot\\nmy fathers next heir  pray sir turning to the waiter\\ndid not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged\\nto the kellynch family\\n\\nno maam he did not mention no particular family but he said\\nhis master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day\\n\\nthere you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said\\nheir to sir walter elliot  i was sure that would come out\\nif it was so  depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants\\ntake care to publish wherever he goes  but anne only conceive\\nhow extraordinary  i wish i had looked at him more  i wish we had\\nbeen aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us\\nwhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other\\ndo you think he had the elliot countenance  i hardly looked at him\\ni was looking at the horses but i think he had something\\nof the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me\\noh the greatcoat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms\\nso it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them\\nand the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning\\none should have known him by the livery\\n\\nputting all these very extraordinary circumstances together\\nsaid captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement\\nof providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin\\n\\nwhen she could command marys attention anne quietly tried\\nto convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years\\nbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction\\nat all desirable\\n\\nat the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself\\nto have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch\\nwas undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense\\nshe would not upon any account mention her having met with him\\nthe second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having\\npassed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt\\nquite illused by annes having actually run against him in the passage\\nand received his very polite excuses while she had never been\\nnear him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain\\na perfect secret\\n\\nof course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot\\nthe next time you write to bath  i think my father certainly\\nought to hear of it do mention all about him\\n\\nanne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance\\nwhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated\\nbut as what ought to be suppressed  the offence which had been given\\nher father many years back she knew elizabeths particular share in it\\nshe suspected and that mr elliots idea always produced irritation in both\\nwas beyond a doubt  mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil\\nof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth\\nfell on anne\\n\\nbreakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain\\nand mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed\\nto take their last walk about lyme  they ought to be setting off\\nfor uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together\\nand out of doors as long as they could\\n\\nanne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all\\nfairly in the street  their conversation the preceding evening\\ndid not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together\\nsome time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron\\nand still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers\\nto think exactly alike of the merits of either till something\\noccasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of\\ncaptain benwick she had captain harville by her side\\n\\nmiss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed\\nin making that poor fellow talk so much  i wish he could have\\nsuch company oftener  it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is\\nbut what can we do  we cannot part\\n\\nno said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible\\nbut in time perhapswe know what time does in every case of affliction\\nand you must remember captain harville that your friend\\nmay yet be called a young mourneronly last summer i understand\\n\\nay true enough with a deep sigh only june\\n\\nand not known to him perhaps so soon\\n\\nnot till the first week of august when he came home from the cape\\njust made into the grappler  i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him\\nhe sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth\\nthere the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i\\ni would as soon have been run up to the yardarm  nobody could do it\\nbut that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth  the laconia\\nhad come into plymouth the week before no danger of her\\nbeing sent to sea again  he stood his chance for the rest\\nwrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return\\ntravelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off\\nto the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week\\nthats what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james\\nyou may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us\\n\\nanne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much\\nin reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed\\nable to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject\\nand when he spoke again it was of something totally different\\n\\nmrs harvilles giving it as her opinion that her husband would have\\nquite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction\\nof all the party in what was to be their last walk they would\\naccompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves\\nby all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew\\nnear the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more\\nall were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined\\nthat the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found\\nwould be no difference at all so with all the kind leavetaking\\nand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which\\nmay be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville\\nat their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick\\nwho seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make\\nthe proper adieus to the cobb\\n\\nanne found captain benwick again drawing near her  lord byrons\\ndark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by\\ntheir present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as\\nattention was possible  it was soon drawn perforce another way\\n\\nthere was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant\\nfor the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower\\nand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight\\nexcepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth\\nin all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles\\nthe sensation was delightful to her  the hardness of the pavement\\nfor her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion\\nhe did it however  she was safely down and instantly\\nto show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again\\nhe advised her against it thought the jar too great but no\\nhe reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined\\ni will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second\\nshe fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless\\nthere was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed\\nshe breathed not her face was like death  the horror of the moment\\nto all who stood around\\n\\ncaptain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms\\nlooking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence\\nshe is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her\\nhusband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable\\nand in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost\\nher senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain\\nbenwick and anne who caught and supported her between them\\n\\nis there no one to help me were the first words which\\nburst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if\\nall his own strength were gone\\n\\ngo to him go to him cried anne for heavens sake go to him\\ni can support her myself  leave me and go to him  rub her hands\\nrub her temples here are salts take them take them\\n\\ncaptain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment\\ndisengaging himself from his wife they were both with him\\nand louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them\\nand everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain\\nwhile captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support\\nexclaimed in the bitterest agony\\n\\noh god her father and mother\\n\\na surgeon said anne\\n\\nhe caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only\\ntrue true a surgeon this instant was darting away\\nwhen anne eagerly suggested\\n\\ncaptain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick\\nhe knows where a surgeon is to be found\\n\\nevery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea\\nand in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had\\nresigned the poor corpselike  figure entirely to the brothers care\\nand was off for the town with the utmost rapidity\\n\\nas to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said\\nwhich of the three who were completely rational was suffering most\\ncaptain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate\\nbrother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes\\nfrom one sister to see the other in a state as insensible\\nor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him\\nfor help which he could not give\\n\\nanne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought\\nwhich instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals\\nto suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles\\nto assuage the feelings of captain wentworth  both seemed to look to her\\nfor directions\\n\\nanne anne cried charles what is to be done next\\nwhat in heavens name is to be done next\\n\\ncaptain wentworths eyes were also turned towards her\\n\\nhad not she better be carried to the inn  yes i am sure\\ncarry her gently to the inn\\n\\nyes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively\\ncollected and eager to be doing something  i will carry her myself\\nmusgrove take care of the others\\n\\nby this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen\\nand boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them\\nto be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of\\na dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine\\nas the first report  to some of the bestlooking of these good people\\nhenrietta was consigned for though partially revived\\nshe was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side\\nand charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back\\nwith feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately\\nand so light of heart they had passed along\\n\\nthey were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them\\ncaptain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance\\nwhich showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately\\ninformed and directed as they passed towards the spot\\nshocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves\\nthat could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife\\ndecided what was to be done  she must be taken to their house\\nall must go to their house and await the surgeons arrival there\\nthey would not listen to scruples  he was obeyed they were all\\nbeneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harvilles direction\\nwas conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed\\nassistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband\\nto all who needed them\\n\\nlouisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again\\nwithout apparent consciousness  this had been a proof of life\\nhowever of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly\\nincapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept\\nby the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility\\nmary too was growing calmer\\n\\nthe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible\\nthey were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless\\nthe head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries\\nrecovered from  he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully\\n\\nthat he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say\\na few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most\\nand the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent\\nafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered\\nmay be conceived\\n\\nthe tone the look with which thank god was uttered\\nby captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her\\nnor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it\\nwith folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by\\nthe various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection\\nto calm them\\n\\nlouisas limbs had escaped  there was no injury but to the head\\n\\nit now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done\\nas to their general situation  they were now able to speak to each other\\nand consult  that louisa must remain where she was however distressing\\nto her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble\\ndid not admit a doubt  her removal was impossible  the harvilles\\nsilenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude\\nthey had looked forward and arranged everything before the others\\nbegan to reflect  captain benwick must give up his room to them\\nand get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled\\nthey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more\\nand yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maids room\\nor swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not\\nfinding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay\\nthough with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be\\nthe least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harvilles care entirely\\nmrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nurserymaid\\nwho had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere\\nwas just such another  between these two she could want\\nno possible attendance by day or night  and all this was said\\nwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible\\n\\ncharles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation\\nand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror\\nuppercross the necessity of some ones going to uppercross\\nthe news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove\\nthe lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they\\nought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time\\nat first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose\\nthan such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth\\nexerting himself said\\n\\nwe must be decided and without the loss of another minute\\nevery minute is valuable  some one must resolve on being off\\nfor uppercross instantly  musgrove either you or i must go\\n\\ncharles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away\\nhe would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville\\nbut as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would\\nso far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same\\nshe however was soon persuaded to think differently  the usefulness\\nof her staying  she who had not been able to remain in louisas room\\nor to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless\\nshe was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good\\nyet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought\\nof her father and mother she gave it up she consented\\nshe was anxious to be at home\\n\\nthe plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly\\ndown from louisas room could not but hear what followed\\nfor the parlour door was open\\n\\nthen it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth\\nthat you stay and that i take care of your sister home\\nbut as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville\\ni think it need be only one  mrs charles musgrove will of course\\nwish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so proper\\nso capable as anne\\n\\nshe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself\\nso spoken of  the other two warmly agreed with what he said\\nand she then appeared\\n\\nyou will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he\\nturning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness\\nwhich seemed almost restoring the past  she coloured deeply\\nand he recollected himself and moved away  she expressed herself\\nmost willing ready happy to remain  it was what she had been\\nthinking of and wishing to be allowed to do  a bed on the floor\\nin louisas room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville\\nwould but think so\\n\\none thing more and all seemed arranged  though it was rather desirable\\nthat mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some\\nshare of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses\\nto take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense\\nand captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed\\nthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn\\nand leave mr musgroves carriage and horses to be sent home\\nthe next morning early when there would be the farther advantage\\nof sending an account of louisas night\\n\\ncaptain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part\\nand to be soon followed by the two ladies  when the plan was\\nmade known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it\\nshe was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice\\nin being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was\\nnothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best right\\nto stay in henriettas stead  why was not she to be as useful as anne\\nand to go home without charles too without her husband\\nno it was too unkind  and in short she said more than her husband\\ncould long withstand and as none of the others could oppose\\nwhen he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for anne\\nwas inevitable\\n\\nanne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous\\nand illjudging claims of mary but so it must be and they set off\\nfor the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick\\nattending to her  she gave a moments recollection as they hurried along\\nto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed\\nearlier in the morning  there she had listened to henriettas schemes\\nfor dr shirleys leaving uppercross farther on she had\\nfirst seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given\\nto any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare\\n\\ncaptain benwick was most considerately attentive to her and\\nunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt\\nan increasing degree of goodwill towards him and a pleasure even\\nin thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing\\ntheir acquaintance\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting\\nstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street\\nbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister\\nfor the other the change in his countenance the astonishment\\nthe expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened to\\nmade but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince her\\nthat she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa\\n\\nshe endeavoured to be composed and to be just  without emulating\\nthe feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have\\nattended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard\\nfor his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust\\nas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend\\n\\nin the mean while she was in the carriage  he had handed them both in\\nand placed himself between them and in this manner under these\\ncircumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme\\nhow the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners\\nwhat was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee\\nit was all quite natural however  he was devoted to henrietta\\nalways turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view\\nof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits  in general\\nhis voice and manner were studiously calm  to spare henrietta\\nfrom agitation seemed the governing principle  once only\\nwhen she had been grieving over the last illjudged illfated\\nwalk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of\\nhe burst forth as if wholly overcome\\n\\ndont talk of it dont talk of it he cried  oh god that i had\\nnot given way to her at the fatal moment  had i done as i ought\\nbut so eager and so resolute dear sweet louisa\\n\\nanne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness\\nof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage\\nof firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that\\nlike all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions\\nand limits  she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel\\nthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness\\nas a very resolute character\\n\\nthey got on fast  anne was astonished to recognise the same hills\\nand the same objects so soon  their actual speed heightened by\\nsome dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long\\nas on the day before  it was growing quite dusk however\\nbefore they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been\\ntotal silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back\\nin the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her\\nhaving cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill\\nanne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth\\nin a low cautious voice he said \\n\\ni have been considering what we had best do  she must not\\nappear at first  she could not stand it  i have been thinking whether\\nyou had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in\\nand break it to mr and mrs musgrove  do you think this is a good plan\\n\\nshe did  he was satisfied and said no more  but the remembrance\\nof the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship\\nand of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became\\na sort of parting proof its value did not lessen\\n\\nwhen the distressing communication at uppercross was over\\nand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped\\nand the daughter all the better for being with them he announced\\nhis intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme\\nand when the horses were baited he was off\\n\\nend of volume one\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 13\\n\\n\\nthe remainder of annes time at uppercross comprehending only two days\\nwas spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction\\nof knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion\\nand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which\\nin mr and mrs musgroves distressed state of spirits would have\\nbeen difficulties\\n\\nthey had an early account from lyme the next morning  louisa was\\nmuch the same  no symptoms worse than before had appeared\\ncharles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and\\nmore particular account  he was tolerably cheerful  a speedy cure\\nmust not be hoped but everything was going on as well\\nas the nature of the case admitted  in speaking of the harvilles\\nhe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness\\nespecially of mrs harvilles exertions as a nurse  she really left\\nnothing for mary to do  he and mary had been persuaded to go early\\nto their inn last night  mary had been hysterical again this morning\\nwhen he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick\\nwhich he hoped would do her good  he almost wished she had been\\nprevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was\\nthat mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do\\n\\ncharles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father\\nhad at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent\\nit would be going only to multiply trouble to the others\\nand increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed\\nand was acted upon  a chaise was sent for from crewkherne\\nand charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nurserymaid\\nof the family one who having brought up all the children\\nand seen the very last the lingering and longpetted master harry\\nsent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery\\nto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could\\nget near her and who consequently was only too happy in being\\nallowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa  vague wishes of\\ngetting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta\\nbut without anne it would hardly have been resolved on\\nand found practicable so soon\\n\\nthey were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all\\nthe minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain\\nevery twentyfour hours  he made it his business to go to lyme\\nand his account was still encouraging  the intervals of sense\\nand consciousness were believed to be stronger  every report agreed\\nin captain wentworths appearing fixed in lyme\\n\\nanne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded\\nwhat should they do without her  they were wretched comforters\\nfor one another  and so much was said in this way that anne thought\\nshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclination\\nto which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once\\nshe had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go\\ngo tomorrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings\\nas it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved\\nthey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with\\nthey might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children\\nand in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted\\nwith what she had done and felt that she could not spend her\\nlast morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations\\nand sending them off at an early hour though her being left\\nto the solitary range of the house was the consequence\\n\\nshe was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage\\nshe was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled\\nand animated both houses of all that had given uppercross\\nits cheerful character  a few days had made a change indeed\\n\\nif louisa recovered it would all be well again  more than\\nformer happiness would be restored  there could not be a doubt\\nto her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery\\na few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by\\nher silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy\\nand gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love\\nall that was most unlike anne elliot\\n\\nan hours complete leisure for such reflections as these\\non a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out\\nthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough\\nto make the sound of lady russells carriage exceedingly welcome\\nand yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house\\nor look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and\\ncomfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses\\nthe last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart\\nscenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious\\nit stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe\\nbut now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling\\nsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could\\nnever be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear\\nshe left it all behind her all but the recollection that\\nsuch things had been\\n\\nanne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russells house\\nin september  it had not been necessary and the few occasions of\\nits being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade\\nand escape from  her first return was to resume her place in the modern\\nand elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes\\nof its mistress\\n\\nthere was some anxiety mixed with lady russells joy in meeting her\\nshe knew who had been frequenting uppercross  but happily\\neither anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell\\nfancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion\\nhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration\\nof her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with\\na second spring of youth and beauty\\n\\nwhen they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change\\nthe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch\\nand which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother\\namong the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest\\nshe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath\\ntheir concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross\\nand when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears\\nand spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place\\nwhich had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still\\nbe with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known\\nhow much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove\\nand all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her\\nwas the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick\\nthan her own fathers house in camden place or her own sisters intimacy\\nwith mrs clay  she was actually forced to exert herself\\nto meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude\\non topics which had by nature the first claim on her\\n\\nthere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse\\non another subject  they must speak of the accident at lyme\\nlady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before\\nwhen a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must\\nbe talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence\\nlament the result and captain wentworths name must be mentioned by both\\nanne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell\\nshe could not speak the name and look straight forward to\\nlady russells eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her\\nbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa\\nwhen this was told his name distressed her no longer\\n\\nlady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy\\nbut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt\\nthat the man who at twentythree had seemed to understand somewhat\\nof the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards\\nbe charmed by a louisa musgrove\\n\\nthe first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance\\nto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme\\nwhich found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought\\na rather improving account of louisa  at the end of that period\\nlady russells politeness could repose no longer and the fainter\\nselfthreatenings of the past became in a decided tone\\ni must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon\\nanne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house\\nit will be some trial to us both\\n\\nanne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said\\nin observing\\n\\ni think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two\\nyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine\\nby remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it\\n\\nshe could have said more on the subject for she had in fact\\nso high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father\\nso very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure\\nof a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief\\nthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal\\nshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gone\\nwho deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed\\ninto better hands than its owners  these convictions must unquestionably\\nhave their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded\\nthat pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again\\nand returning through the wellknown apartments\\n\\nin such moments anne had no power of saying to herself\\nthese rooms ought to belong only to us  oh how fallen\\nin their destination  how unworthily occupied  an ancient family\\nto be so driven away  strangers filling their place\\nno except when she thought of her mother and remembered where\\nshe had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description\\nto heave\\n\\nmrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure\\nof fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion\\nreceiving her in that house there was particular attention\\n\\nthe sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic\\nand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared\\nthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn\\nthat captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time\\nsince the accident had brought anne the last note which she had\\nnot been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours\\nand then returned again to lyme and without any present intention\\nof quitting it any more  he had enquired after her she found\\nparticularly had expressed his hope of miss elliots not being\\nthe worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great\\nthis was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else\\ncould have done\\n\\nas to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style\\nby a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work\\non ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been\\nthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence\\nthat its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think\\nhow long miss musgroves recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable\\nshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter\\nthe admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming\\n\\nay a very bad business indeed  a new sort of way this\\nfor a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistresss head\\nis not it miss elliot  this is breaking a head and giving a plaster\\ntruly\\n\\nadmiral crofts manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell\\nbut they delighted anne  his goodness of heart and simplicity\\nof character were irresistible\\n\\nnow this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from\\na little reverie to be coming and finding us here  i had not\\nrecollected it before i declare but it must be very bad\\nbut now do not stand upon ceremony  get up and go over all the rooms\\nin the house if you like it\\n\\nanother time sir i thank you not now\\n\\nwell whenever it suits you  you can slip in from the shrubbery\\nat any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up\\nby that door  a good place is not it  but checking himself\\nyou will not think it a good place for yours were always kept\\nin the butlers room  ay so it always is i believe\\none mans ways may be as good as anothers but we all like our own best\\nand so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you\\nto go about the house or not\\n\\nanne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully\\n\\nwe have made very few changes either continued the admiral\\nafter thinking a moment  very few  we told you about the laundrydoor\\nat uppercross  that has been a very great improvement\\nthe wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience\\nof its opening as it did so long  you will tell sir walter\\nwhat we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement\\nthe house ever had  indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say\\nthat the few alterations we have made have been all very much\\nfor the better  my wife should have the credit of them however\\ni have done very little besides sending away some of the large\\nlookingglasses from my dressingroom which was your fathers\\na very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure\\nbut i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection\\ni should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life\\nsuch a number of lookingglasses oh lord there was no getting away\\nfrom ones self  so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon\\nshifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my\\nlittle shaving glass in one corner and another great thing\\nthat i never go near\\n\\nanne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer\\nand the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough\\ntook up the subject again to say\\n\\nthe next time you write to your good father miss elliot\\npray give him my compliments and mrs crofts and say that we are\\nsettled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find\\nwith the place  the breakfastroom chimney smokes a little\\ni grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard\\nwhich may not happen three times a winter  and take it altogether\\nnow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge\\nthere is not one that we like better than this  pray say so\\nwith my compliments  he will be glad to hear it\\n\\nlady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other\\nbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed\\nfar at present for when it was returned the crofts announced\\nthemselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions\\nin the north of the county and probably might not be at home again\\nbefore lady russell would be removing to bath\\n\\nso ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall\\nor of seeing him in company with her friend  everything was safe enough\\nand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted\\non the subject\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 14\\n\\n\\nthough charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after\\nmr and mrs musgroves going than anne conceived they could have been\\nat all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again\\nand as soon as possible after their return to uppercross\\nthey drove over to the lodge  they had left louisa beginning to sit up\\nbut her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves\\nsusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though\\nshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well\\nit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear\\nthe removal home and her father and mother who must return\\nin time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays\\nhad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them\\n\\nthey had been all in lodgings together  mrs musgrove had\\ngot mrs harvilles children away as much as she could every possible\\nsupply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience\\nto the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them\\nto come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been\\nonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested\\nand hospitable\\n\\nmary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident\\nby her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer\\ncharles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when\\nthey dined with the harvilles there had been only a maidservant to wait\\nand at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence\\nbut then she had received so very handsome an apology from her\\non finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much\\ngoing on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings\\nand the harvilles and she had got books from the library\\nand changed them so often that the balance had certainly been\\nmuch in favour of lyme  she had been taken to charmouth too\\nand she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many\\nmore people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross\\nand all this joined to the sense of being so very useful\\nhad made really an agreeable fortnight\\n\\nanne enquired after captain benwick marys face was clouded directly\\ncharles laughed\\n\\noh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is\\na very odd young man  i do not know what he would be at\\nwe asked him to come home with us for a day or two  charles undertook\\nto give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part\\ni thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night\\nhe made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had\\nbeen quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had\\npromised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come\\ni suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word\\ni should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage\\nfor such a heartbroken man as captain benwick\\n\\ncharles laughed again and said now mary you know very well\\nhow it really was  it was all your doing turning to anne\\nhe fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by\\nhe fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered\\nthat lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him\\nand he had not courage to come  that is the fact upon my honour\\nmary knows it is\\n\\nbut mary did not give into it very graciously whether from\\nnot considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation\\nto be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe\\nanne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be\\nleft to be guessed  annes goodwill however was not to be lessened\\nby what she heard  she boldly acknowledged herself flattered\\nand continued her enquiries\\n\\noh he talks of you cried charles in such terms\\nmary interrupted him i declare charles i never heard him\\nmention anne twice all the time i was there  i declare anne\\nhe never talks of you at all\\n\\nno admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general\\nway but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly\\nhis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation\\nand he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other\\nin one of them which he thinksoh i cannot pretend to remember it\\nbut it was something very finei overheard him telling henrietta\\nall about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms\\nnow mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were\\nin the other room  elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end\\nof miss elliots charms\\n\\nand i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit\\nif he did  miss harville only died last june  such a heart\\nis very little worth having is it lady russell  i am sure\\nyou will agree with me\\n\\ni must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling\\n\\nand that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you maam\\nsaid charles  though he had not nerves for coming away with us\\nand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here\\nhe will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself\\nyou may depend on it  i told him the distance and the road\\nand i told him of the churchs being so very well worth seeing\\nfor as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would\\nbe a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul\\nand i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon\\nso i give you notice lady russell\\n\\nany acquaintance of annes will always be welcome to me\\nwas lady russells kind answer\\n\\noh as to being annes acquaintance said mary i think he is rather\\nmy acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight\\n\\nwell as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy\\nto see captain benwick\\n\\nyou will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you maam\\nhe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived  he has walked with me\\nsometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word\\nhe is not at all a wellbred young man  i am sure you will not like him\\n\\nthere we differ mary said anne  i think lady russell would like him\\ni think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would\\nvery soon see no deficiency in his manner\\n\\nso do i anne said charles  i am sure lady russell would like him\\nhe is just lady russells sort  give him a book and he will\\nread all day long\\n\\nyes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly  he will sit poring\\nover his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one\\ndrops ones scissors or anything that happens  do you think\\nlady russell would like that\\n\\nlady russell could not help laughing  upon my word said she\\ni should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have\\nadmitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact\\nas i may call myself  i have really a curiosity to see the person\\nwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notions\\ni wish he may be induced to call here  and when he does mary\\nyou may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined\\nnot to judge him beforehand\\n\\nyou will not like him i will answer for it\\n\\nlady russell began talking of something else  mary spoke with animation\\nof their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily\\n\\nhe is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see\\nhis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family\\nhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me\\n\\nthis decision checked marys eagerness and stopped her short\\nin the midst of the elliot countenance\\n\\nwith regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries\\nthere was voluntary communication sufficient  his spirits had been\\ngreatly recovering lately as might be expected  as louisa improved\\nhe had improved and he was now quite a different creature\\nfrom what he had been the first week  he had not seen louisa\\nand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her\\nfrom an interview that he did not press for it at all and\\non the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week\\nor ten days till her head was stronger  he had talked of going\\ndown to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick\\nto go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick\\nseemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch\\n\\nthere can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both\\noccasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time\\nlady russell could not hear the doorbell without feeling that it might\\nbe his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence\\nin her fathers grounds or any visit of charity in the village\\nwithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of him\\ncaptain benwick came not however  he was either less disposed for it\\nthan charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him\\na weeks indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy\\nof the interest which he had been beginning to excite\\n\\nthe musgroves came back to receive

rest of the family were again in their usual quarters\\n\\nlady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once\\nwhen anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again\\nthough neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter\\nnor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast\\nas could be wished to the last state she had seen it in\\n\\nimmediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles\\nwhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children\\nfrom the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them  on one side\\nwas a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk\\nand gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays\\nbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys\\nwere holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire\\nwhich seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise\\nof the others  charles and mary also came in of course\\nduring their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects\\nto lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes\\ntalking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children\\non his knees generally in vain  it was a fine familypiece\\n\\nanne judging from her own temperament would have deemed\\nsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves\\nwhich louisas illness must have so greatly shaken  but mrs musgrove\\nwho got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially\\nagain and again for all her attentions to them concluded\\na short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing\\nwith a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through\\nnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness\\nat home\\n\\nlouisa was now recovering apace  her mother could even think of her\\nbeing able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters\\nwent to school again  the harvilles had promised to come with her\\nand stay at uppercross whenever she returned  captain wentworth was gone\\nfor the present to see his brother in shropshire\\n\\ni hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as\\nthey were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross\\nin the christmas holidays\\n\\neverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters\\nand sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort\\nrather than their quantity  when lady russell not long afterwards\\nwas entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through\\nthe long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place\\namidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays\\nthe bawling of newspapermen muffinmen and milkmen and the ceaseless\\nclink of pattens she made no complaint  no these were noises\\nwhich belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose\\nunder their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feeling\\nthough not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be\\nso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness\\n\\nanne did not share these feelings  she persisted in a very determined\\nthough very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view\\nof the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish\\nof seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be\\nhowever disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her\\nwhen she arrived  and looked back with fond regret to the bustles\\nof uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch\\n\\nelizabeths last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest\\nmr elliot was in bath  he had called in camden place had called\\na second time a third had been pointedly attentive  if elizabeth\\nand her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains\\nto seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection\\nas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect  this was very wonderful\\nif it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable\\ncuriosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment\\nshe had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had\\nno wish to see  she had a great wish to see him  if he really sought\\nto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven\\nfor having dismembered himself from the paternal tree\\n\\nanne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance\\nbut she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not\\nwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in bath\\n\\nshe was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove\\nto her own lodgings in rivers street\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 15\\n\\n\\nsir walter had taken a very good house in camden place\\na lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence\\nand both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction\\n\\nanne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment\\nof many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i\\nleave you again  a degree of unexpected cordiality however\\nin the welcome she received did her good  her father and sister\\nwere glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture\\nand met her with kindness  her making a fourth when they\\nsat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage\\n\\nmrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles\\nwere more a matter of course  anne had always felt that she would\\npretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others\\nwas unlooked for  they were evidently in excellent spirits\\nand she was soon to listen to the causes  they had no inclination\\nto listen to her  after laying out for some compliments of being\\ndeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay\\nthey had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be\\nall their own  uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little\\nit was all bath\\n\\nthey had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered\\ntheir expectations in every respect  their house was undoubtedly\\nthe best in camden place their drawingrooms had many decided advantages\\nover all the others which they had either seen or heard of\\nand the superiority was not less in the style of the fittingup\\nor the taste of the furniture  their acquaintance was\\nexceedingly sought after  everybody was wanting to visit them\\nthey had drawn back from many introductions and still were\\nperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing\\n\\nhere were funds of enjoyment  could anne wonder that her father\\nand sister were happy  she might not wonder but she must sigh\\nthat her father should feel no degradation in his change should see\\nnothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder\\nshould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town\\nand she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open\\nthe foldingdoors and walked with exultation from one drawingroom\\nto the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman\\nwho had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of\\nbetween two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder\\n\\nbut this was not all which they had to make them happy\\nthey had mr elliot too  anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot\\nhe was not only pardoned they were delighted with him\\nhe had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath\\nin november in his way to london when the intelligence of\\nsir walters being settled there had of course reached him\\nthough only twentyfour hours in the place but he had not been able\\nto avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath\\nand his first object on arriving had been to leave his card\\nin camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet\\nand when they did meet by such great openness of conduct\\nsuch readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received\\nas a relation again that their former good understanding\\nwas completely reestablished\\n\\nthey had not a fault to find in him  he had explained away\\nall the appearance of neglect on his own side  it had originated\\nin misapprehension entirely  he had never had an idea of\\nthrowing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off\\nbut knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent  upon the hint\\nof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family\\nand the family honours he was quite indignant  he who had ever boasted\\nof being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection\\nwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day\\nhe was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct\\nmust refute it  he could refer sir walter to all who knew him\\nand certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity\\nof reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation\\nand heirpresumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject\\n\\nthe circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of\\nmuch extenuation  this was an article not to be entered on by himself\\nbut a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly\\nrespectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an illlooking man\\nsir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough\\nbuildings and had at his own particular request been admitted\\nto their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things\\nrelative to the marriage which made a material difference\\nin the discredit of it\\n\\ncolonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted\\nalso with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story\\nshe was certainly not a woman of family but well educated\\naccomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend\\nthere had been the charm  she had sought him  without that attraction\\nnot all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was\\nmoreover assured of her having been a very fine woman\\nhere was a great deal to soften the business  a very fine woman\\nwith a large fortune in love with him  sir walter seemed to admit it\\nas complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance\\nin quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation\\n\\nmr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once\\nevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they\\ngave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof\\nof cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being\\non intimate terms in camden place\\n\\nanne listened but without quite understanding it  allowances\\nlarge allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke\\nshe heard it all under embellishment  all that sounded extravagant\\nor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin\\nbut in the language of the relators  still however she had\\nthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared\\nin mr elliots wishing after an interval of so many years\\nto be well received by them  in a worldly view he had nothing to gain\\nby being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance\\nin all probability he was already the richer of the two\\nand the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title\\na sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man\\nwhy should it be an object to him  she could only offer one solution\\nit was perhaps for elizabeths sake  there might really have been\\na liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him\\na different way and now that he could afford to please himself\\nhe might mean to pay his addresses to her  elizabeth was certainly\\nvery handsome with wellbred elegant manners and her character\\nmight never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public\\nand when very young himself  how her temper and understanding\\nmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of life\\nwas another concern and rather a fearful one  most earnestly did she wish\\nthat he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth\\nwere his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so\\nand that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent\\nby a glance or two between them while mr elliots frequent visits\\nwere talked of\\n\\nanne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without\\nbeing much attended to  oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot\\nthey did not know  it might be him perhaps  they could not listen\\nto her description of him  they were describing him themselves\\nsir walter especially  he did justice to his very gentlemanlike\\nappearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face\\nhis sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being\\nvery much underhung a defect which time seemed to have increased\\nnor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered\\nalmost every feature for the worse  mr elliot appeared to think\\nthat he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when\\nthey last parted but sir walter had not been able to return\\nthe compliment entirely which had embarrassed him  he did not mean\\nto complain however  mr elliot was better to look at than most men\\nand he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere\\n\\nmr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of\\nthe whole evening  colonel wallis had been so impatient to be\\nintroduced to them and mr elliot so anxious that he should\\nand there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description\\nas she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot\\nspoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known\\nin camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted\\nsir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be\\nan excessively pretty woman beautiful  he longed to see her\\nhe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces\\nhe was continually passing in the streets  the worst of bath was\\nthe number of its plain women  he did not mean to say that there were\\nno pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion\\nhe had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face\\nwould be followed by thirty or fiveandthirty frights and once\\nas he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted\\neightyseven women go by one after another without there being\\na tolerable face among them  it had been a frosty morning\\nto be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand\\ncould stand the test of  but still there certainly were\\na dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men\\nthey were infinitely worse  such scarecrows as the streets were full of\\nit was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything\\ntolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced\\nhe had never walked anywhere arminarm with colonel wallis\\nwho was a fine military figure though sandyhaired without observing\\nthat every womans eye was upon him every womans eye was sure to be\\nupon colonel wallis  modest sir walter  he was not allowed\\nto escape however  his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting\\nthat colonel walliss companion might have as good a figure\\nas colonel wallis and certainly was not sandyhaired\\n\\nhow is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour\\nthe last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not\\nhappen every day\\n\\noh no that must have been quite accidental  in general she has been\\nin very good health and very good looks since michaelmas\\n\\nif i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds\\nand grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse\\n\\nanne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown\\nor a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door\\nsuspended everything  a knock at the door and so late\\nit was ten oclock  could it be mr elliot  they knew he was to dine\\nin lansdown crescent  it was possible that he might stop in his way home\\nto ask them how they did  they could think of no one else\\nmrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliots knock  mrs clay was right\\nwith all the state which a butler and footboy could give\\nmr elliot was ushered into the room\\n\\nit was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress\\nanne drew a little back while the others received his compliments\\nand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour\\nbut he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she\\nnor her friend had taken cold the day before c c which was\\nall as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part\\nmust follow then  sir walter talked of his youngest daughter\\nmr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\\nthere was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and\\nblushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features\\nwhich he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement\\nat his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware\\nof who she was  he looked completely astonished but not more astonished\\nthan pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity\\nhe welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated\\nto be received as an acquaintance already  he was quite as goodlooking\\nas he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking\\nand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished\\nso easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them\\nin excellence to only one persons manners  they were not the same\\nbut they were perhaps equally good\\n\\nhe sat down with them and improved their conversation very much\\nthere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man  ten minutes\\nwere enough to certify that  his tone his expressions\\nhis choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all\\nthe operation of a sensible discerning mind  as soon as he could\\nhe began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions\\nrespecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance\\nof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time\\nto give his own route understand something of hers and regret that\\nhe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her\\nshe gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme\\nhis regret increased as he listened  he had spent his whole\\nsolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices\\nmirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people\\nlonged to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion\\nof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself\\nif he had but asked who the party were  the name of musgrove would\\nhave told him enough  well it would serve to cure him of\\nan absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn\\nwhich he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal\\nof its being very ungenteel to be curious\\n\\nthe notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he\\nas to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing\\nare more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings\\nin the world  the folly of the means they often employ\\nis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view\\n\\nbut he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone\\nhe knew it he was soon diffused again among the others\\nand it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme\\n\\nhis enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene\\nshe had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place\\nhaving alluded to an accident  he must hear the whole\\nwhen he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also\\nbut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt\\nshe could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish\\nof really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern\\nfor what she must have suffered in witnessing it\\n\\nhe staid an hour with them  the elegant little clock on the mantel\\npiece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman\\nwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale\\nbefore mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long\\n\\nanne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in\\ncamden place could have passed so well\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 16\\n\\n\\nthere was one point which anne on returning to her family\\nwould have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliots\\nbeing in love with elizabeth which was her fathers not being\\nin love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it\\nwhen she had been at home a few hours  on going down to breakfast\\nthe next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence\\non the ladys side of meaning to leave them  she could imagine mrs clay\\nto have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself\\nat all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper\\nthat must not be any reason indeed  i assure you i feel it none\\nshe is nothing to me compared with you  and she was in full time\\nto hear her father say my dear madam this must not be  as yet\\nyou have seen nothing of bath  you have been here only to be useful\\nyou must not run away from us now  you must stay to be acquainted\\nwith mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis  to your fine mind\\ni well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification\\n\\nhe spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised\\nto see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself\\nher countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness\\nbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought\\nin her sister  the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties\\nand promise to stay\\n\\nin the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be\\nalone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks\\nhe thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin\\nher complexion greatly improved clearer fresher  had she been\\nusing any thing in particular  no nothing  merely gowland\\nhe supposed  no nothing at all  ha he was surprised at that\\nand added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are\\nyou cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland\\nthe constant use of gowland during the spring months  mrs clay has been\\nusing it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her\\nyou see how it has carried away her freckles\\n\\nif elizabeth could but have heard this  such personal praise\\nmight have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne\\nthat the freckles were at all lessened  but everything must\\ntake its chance  the evil of a marriage would be much diminished\\nif elizabeth were also to marry  as for herself she might always\\ncommand a home with lady russell\\n\\nlady russells composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial\\non this point in her intercourse in camden place  the sight of mrs clay\\nin such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation\\nto her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bath\\nwho drinks the water gets all the new publications and has\\na very large acquaintance has time to be vexed\\n\\nas mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable\\nor more indifferent towards the others  his manners were\\nan immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found\\nthe solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first\\nas she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot\\nand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable\\nor estimable man  everything united in him good understanding\\ncorrect opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart\\nhe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour\\nwithout pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune\\nwithout display he judged for himself in everything essential\\nwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum\\nhe was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits\\nor by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet\\nwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value\\nfor all the felicities of domestic life which characters of\\nfancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess\\nshe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage  colonel wallis\\nsaid it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness\\nto sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his\\nthinking of a second choice  her satisfaction in mr elliot\\noutweighed all the plague of mrs clay\\n\\nit was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she\\nand her excellent friend could sometimes think differently\\nand it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell\\nshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require\\nmore motives than appeared in mr elliots great desire of a reconciliation\\nin lady russells view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot\\nat a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object\\nand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people\\nto be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process\\nin the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring\\nin the heyday of youth  anne presumed however still to smile about it\\nand at last to mention elizabeth  lady russell listened and looked\\nand made only this cautious replyelizabeth very well\\ntime will explain\\n\\nit was a reference to the future which anne after a little observation\\nfelt she must submit to  she could determine nothing at present\\nin that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit\\nof such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity\\nof attention seemed almost impossible  mr elliot too\\nit must be remembered had not been a widower seven months\\na little delay on his side might be very excusable  in fact\\nanne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that\\nshe was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations\\nfor though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed\\nso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery\\nfrom the awful impression of its being dissolved\\n\\nhowever it might end he was without any question their\\npleasantest acquaintance in bath  she saw nobody equal to him\\nand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme\\nwhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of\\nas herself  they went through the particulars of their first meeting\\na great many times  he gave her to understand that he had\\nlooked at her with some earnestness  she knew it well\\nand she remembered another persons look also\\n\\nthey did not always think alike  his value for rank and connexion\\nshe perceived was greater than hers  it was not merely complaisance\\nit must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly\\ninto her father and sisters solicitudes on a subject which\\nshe thought unworthy to excite them  the bath paper one morning\\nannounced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple\\nand her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfort\\nof no camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymples\\nin annes opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots\\nand the agony was how to introduce themselves properly\\n\\nanne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility\\nand she must acknowledge herself disappointed  she had hoped\\nbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in life\\nand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen\\na wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple\\nand miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears\\nall day long\\n\\nsir walter had once been in company with the late viscount\\nbut had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties\\nof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse\\nby letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount\\nwhen in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walters\\nat the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch\\nno letter of condolence had been sent to ireland  the neglect\\nhad been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot\\ndied herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch\\nand consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend\\nthat the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed\\nhow to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted\\nas cousins again was the question  and it was a question which\\nin a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\nthought unimportant  family connexions were always worth preserving\\ngood company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house\\nfor three months in laura place and would be living in style\\nshe had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her\\nspoken of as a charming woman  it was very desirable that\\nthe connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any\\ncompromise of propriety on the side of the elliots\\n\\nsir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote\\na very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty\\nto his right honourable cousin  neither lady russell nor mr elliot\\ncould admire the letter but it did all that was wanted\\nin bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess\\nshe was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance\\nthe toils of the business were over the sweets began  they visited\\nin laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple\\nand the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might\\nbe most visible  and our cousins in laura placeour cousin\\nlady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody\\n\\nanne was ashamed  had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been\\nvery agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation\\nthey created but they were nothing  there was no superiority of manner\\naccomplishment or understanding  lady dalrymple had acquired\\nthe name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer\\nfor everybody  miss carteret with still less to say was so plain\\nand so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place\\nbut for her birth\\n\\nlady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet\\nit was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak\\nher opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing\\nin themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion\\nas good company as those who would collect good company around them\\nthey had their value  anne smiled and said\\n\\nmy idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever\\nwellinformed people who have a great deal of conversation\\nthat is what i call good company\\n\\nyou are mistaken said he gently that is not good company\\nthat is the best  good company requires only birth education\\nand manners and with regard to education is not very nice\\nbirth and good manners are essential but a little learning is\\nby no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary\\nit will do very well  my cousin anne shakes her head\\nshe is not satisfied  she is fastidious  my dear cousin\\nsitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious\\nthan almost any other woman i know but will it answer\\nwill it make you happy  will it not be wiser to accept the society\\nof those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages\\nof the connexion as far as possible  you may depend upon it\\nthat they will move in the first set in bath this winter\\nand as rank is rank your being known to be related to them\\nwill have its use in fixing your family our family let me say\\nin that degree of consideration which we must all wish for\\n\\nyes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them\\nthen recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added\\ni certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken\\nto procure the acquaintance  i suppose smiling i have more pride\\nthan any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be\\nso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may\\nbe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them\\n\\npardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims\\nin london perhaps in your present quiet style of living\\nit might be as you say  but in bath sir walter elliot and his family\\nwill always be worth knowing  always acceptable as acquaintance\\n\\nwell said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome\\nwhich depends so entirely upon place\\n\\ni love your indignation said he it is very natural\\nbut here you are in bath and the object is to be established here\\nwith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot\\nyou talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish\\nto believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated\\nwould have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem\\na little different  in one point i am sure my dear cousin\\nhe continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room\\nin one point i am sure we must feel alike  we must feel that\\nevery addition to your fathers society among his equals or superiors\\nmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him\\n\\nhe looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been\\nlately occupying  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant\\nand though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride\\nshe was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscience\\nadmitted that his wishing to promote her fathers getting\\ngreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 17\\n\\n\\nwhile sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their\\ngood fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance\\nof a very different description\\n\\nshe had called on her former governess and had heard from her\\nof there being an old schoolfellow in bath who had the two strong claims\\non her attention of past kindness and present suffering  miss hamilton\\nnow mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life\\nwhen it had been most valuable  anne had gone unhappy to school\\ngrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved\\nfeeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen\\nof strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time\\nand miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want\\nof near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school\\nhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened\\nher misery and could never be remembered with indifference\\n\\nmiss

situation forward in a more decided but very different form\\n\\nshe was a widow and poor  her husband had been extravagant\\nand at his death about two years before had left his affairs\\ndreadfully involved  she had had difficulties of every sort\\nto contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted\\nwith a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs\\nhad made her for the present a cripple  she had come to bath\\non that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths\\nliving in a very humble way unable even to afford herself\\nthe comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society\\n\\ntheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit\\nfrom miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore\\nlost no time in going  she mentioned nothing of what she had heard\\nor what she intended at home  it would excite no proper interest there\\nshe only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments\\nand was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smiths lodgings\\nin westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken\\n\\nthe visit was paid their acquaintance reestablished their interest\\nin each other more than rekindled  the first ten minutes\\nhad its awkwardness and its emotion  twelve years were gone\\nsince they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person\\nfrom what the other had imagined  twelve years had changed anne\\nfrom the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant\\nlittle woman of sevenandtwenty with every beauty except bloom\\nand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle\\nand twelve years had transformed the finelooking wellgrown miss hamilton\\nin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor\\ninfirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee\\nas a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon\\npassed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering\\nformer partialities and talking over old times\\n\\nanne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which\\nshe had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse\\nand be cheerful beyond her expectation  neither the dissipations\\nof the pastand she had lived very much in the worldnor the restrictions\\nof the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have\\nclosed her heart or ruined her spirits\\n\\nin the course of a second visit she talked with great openness\\nand annes astonishment increased  she could scarcely imagine\\na more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smiths  she had been\\nvery fond of her husband  she had buried him  she had been\\nused to affluence  it was gone  she had no child to connect her\\nwith life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement\\nof perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable\\nher accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom\\nbehind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without\\nassistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford\\nand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath\\nyet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she had\\nmoments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation\\nand enjoyment  how could it be  she watched observed reflected\\nand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude\\nor of resignation only  a submissive spirit might be patient\\na strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more\\nhere was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted\\nthat power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment\\nwhich carried her out of herself which was from nature alone\\nit was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friend\\nas one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment\\nit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want\\n\\nthere had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits\\nhad nearly failed  she could not call herself an invalid now\\ncompared with her state on first reaching bath  then she had indeed\\nbeen a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey\\nand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again\\nconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain\\nand all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having\\na regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit\\nto meet any extraordinary expense  she had weathered it however\\nand could truly say that it had done her good  it had increased\\nher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands\\nshe had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested\\nattachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady\\nhad a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been\\nparticularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady\\na nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house\\nwhen unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her\\nand she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably\\nhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance  as soon as i could\\nuse my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement\\nand she put me in the way of making these little threadcases\\npincushions and cardracks which you always find me so busy about\\nand which supply me with the means of doing a little good\\nto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood\\nshe had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those\\nwho can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandise\\nshe always takes the right time for applying  everybodys heart is open\\nyou know when they have recently escaped from severe pain\\nor are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke\\nthoroughly understands when to speak  she is a shrewd intelligent\\nsensible woman  hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has\\na fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her\\ninfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received\\nthe best education in the world know nothing worth attending to\\ncall it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hours\\nleisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate\\nthat is entertaining and profitable  something that makes one\\nknow ones species better  one likes to hear what is going on\\nto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly\\nto me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat\\n\\nanne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied\\ni can easily believe it  women of that class have great opportunities\\nand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to\\nsuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing\\nand it is not merely in its follies that they are well read\\nfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be\\nmost interesting or affecting  what instances must pass before them\\nof ardent disinterested selfdenying attachment of heroism fortitude\\npatience resignation  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices\\nthat ennoble us most  a sick chamber may often furnish\\nthe worth of volumes\\n\\nyes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may\\nthough i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe\\nhere and there human nature may be great in times of trial\\nbut generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength\\nthat appears in a sick chamber  it is selfishness and impatience\\nrather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of\\nthere is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately\\nspeaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget\\nto think seriously till it is almost too late\\n\\nanne saw the misery of such feelings  the husband had not been\\nwhat he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind\\nwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved\\nit was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off\\nand soon added in a different tone\\n\\ni do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present\\nwill furnish much either to interest or edify me  she is only nursing\\nmrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive\\nfashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report\\nbut of lace and finery  i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however\\nshe has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all\\nthe highpriced things i have in hand now\\n\\nanne had called several times on her friend before the existence\\nof such a person was known in camden place  at last it became necessary\\nto speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning\\nfrom laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple\\nfor the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening\\nin westgate buildings  she was not sorry for the excuse\\nthey were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being\\nkept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship\\nwhich had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account\\nwith great alacrityshe was engaged to spend the evening\\nwith an old schoolfellow  they were not much interested in anything\\nrelative to anne but still there were questions enough asked\\nto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabeth\\nwas disdainful and sir walter severe\\n\\nwestgate buildings said he and who is miss anne elliot\\nto be visiting in westgate buildings  a mrs smith  a widow mrs smith\\nand who was her husband  one of five thousand mr smiths whose names\\nare to be met with everywhere  and what is her attraction\\nthat she is old and sickly  upon my word miss anne elliot\\nyou have the most extraordinary taste  everything that revolts\\nother people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations\\nare inviting to you  but surely you may put off this old lady\\ntill tomorrow  she is not so near her end i presume\\nbut that she may hope to see another day  what is her age  forty\\n\\nno sir she is not oneandthirty but i do not think i can\\nput off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time\\nwhich will at once suit her and myself  she goes into the warm bath\\ntomorrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged\\n\\nbut what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth\\n\\nshe sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary\\nshe approves it and has generally taken me when i have\\ncalled on mrs smith\\n\\nwestgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance\\nof a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter\\nsir henry russells widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms\\nbut still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known\\nto convey a miss elliot  a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings\\na poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty\\na mere mrs smith an everyday mrs smith of all people and all names\\nin the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot\\nand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility\\nof england and ireland  mrs smith  such a name\\n\\nmrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it\\nadvisable to leave the room and anne could have said much\\nand did long to say a little in defence of her friends\\nnot very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect\\nto her father prevented her  she made no reply  she left it\\nto himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow\\nin bath between thirty and forty with little to live on\\nand no surname of dignity\\n\\nanne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course\\nshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening\\nshe had been the only one of the set absent for sir walter\\nand elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyships service themselves\\nbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others\\nand had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot\\nand mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early\\nand lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements\\nin order to wait on her  anne had the whole history of all that\\nsuch an evening could supply from lady russell  to her\\nits greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of\\nbetween her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regretted\\nand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause\\nher kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow\\nsick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot\\nhe thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners\\nmind a model of female excellence  he could meet even lady russell\\nin a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understand\\nso much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated\\nby a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations\\nwhich her friend meant to create\\n\\nlady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot\\nshe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of\\nhis deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks\\nwhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood\\nand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing\\nshe would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject\\nshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter\\nof a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance\\nsupposing such attachment to be real and returned  anne heard her\\nand made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed\\nand gently shook her head\\n\\ni am no matchmaker as you well know said lady russell\\nbeing much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events\\nand calculations  i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence\\npay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him\\ni think there would be every possibility of your being happy together\\na most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think\\nit might be a very happy one\\n\\nmr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects\\ni think highly of him said anne but we should not suit\\n\\nlady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that\\nto be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch\\nthe future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying\\nyour dear mothers place succeeding to all her rights\\nand all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be\\nthe highest possible gratification to me  you are your mothers self\\nin countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you\\nsuch as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing\\nin the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued\\nmy dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt\\nat my time of life\\n\\nanne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table\\nand leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings\\nthis picture excited  for a few moments her imagination and her heart\\nwere bewitched  the idea of becoming what her mother had been\\nof having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself\\nof being restored to kellynch calling it her home again\\nher home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist\\nlady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter\\nto its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment\\nwith propriety have spoken for himselfshe believed in short\\nwhat anne did not believe  the same image of mr elliot speaking\\nfor himself brought anne to composure again  the charm of kellynch\\nand of lady elliot all faded away  she never could accept him\\nand it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man\\nsave one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities\\nof such a case was against mr elliot\\n\\nthough they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied\\nthat she really knew his character  that he was a sensible man\\nan agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions\\nseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all\\nclear enough  he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix\\non any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would\\nhave been afraid to answer for his conduct  she distrusted the past\\nif not the present  the names which occasionally dropt\\nof former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits\\nsuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been\\nshe saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling\\nhad been a common thing that there had been a period of his life\\nand probably not a short one when he had been at least\\ncareless in all serious matters and though he might now think\\nvery differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever\\ncautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character\\nhow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed\\n\\nmr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open\\nthere was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight\\nat the evil or good of others  this to anne was a decided imperfection\\nher early impressions were incurable  she prized the frank\\nthe openhearted the eager character beyond all others\\nwarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still  she felt that she could\\nso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked\\nor said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind\\nnever varied whose tongue never slipped\\n\\nmr elliot was too generally agreeable  various as were the tempers\\nin her fathers house he pleased them all  he endured too well\\nstood too well with every body  he had spoken to her with some\\ndegree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see\\nwhat mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet\\nmrs clay found him as agreeable as any body\\n\\nlady russell saw either less or more than her young friend\\nfor she saw nothing to excite distrust  she could not imagine\\na man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she\\never enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive\\nthe hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of\\nthe following autumn\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 18\\n\\n\\nit was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath\\nwas growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme\\nshe wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated\\nit was three weeks since she had heard at all  she only knew\\nthat henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be\\nrecovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all\\nvery intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary\\nwas delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise\\nwith admiral and mrs crofts compliments\\n\\nthe crofts must be in bath  a circumstance to interest her\\nthey were people whom her heart turned to very naturally\\n\\nwhat is this cried sir walter  the crofts have arrived in bath\\nthe crofts who rent kellynch  what have they brought you\\n\\na letter from uppercross cottage sir\\n\\noh those letters are convenient passports  they secure an introduction\\ni should have visited admiral croft however at any rate\\ni know what is due to my tenant\\n\\nanne could listen no longer she could not even have told how\\nthe poor admirals complexion escaped her letter engrossed her\\nit had been begun several days back\\n\\n\\n            february 1st\\n\\nmy dear annei make no apology for my silence because i know\\nhow little people think of letters in such a place as bath\\nyou must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which\\nas you well know affords little to write about  we have had\\na very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party\\nall the holidays  i do not reckon the hayters as anybody\\nthe holidays however are over at last  i believe no children ever had\\nsuch long ones  i am sure i had not  the house was cleared yesterday\\nexcept of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear\\nthey have never gone home  mrs harville must be an odd mother\\nto part with them so long  i do not understand it  they are\\nnot at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to\\nlike them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren\\nwhat dreadful weather we have had  it may not be felt in bath\\nwith your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence\\ni have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january\\nexcept charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome\\nbetween ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme\\nas long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way\\nthe carriage is gone today to bring louisa and the harvilles tomorrow\\nwe are not asked to dine with them however till the day after\\nmrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey\\nwhich is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her\\nand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there tomorrow\\ni am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted\\nwith him too but i have my usual luck  i am always out of the way\\nwhen any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family\\nto be noticed  what an immense time mrs clay has been staying\\nwith elizabeth  does she never mean to go away  but perhaps\\nif she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited\\nlet me know what you think of this  i do not expect my children\\nto be asked you know  i can leave them at the great house very well\\nfor a month or six weeks  i have this moment heard that the crofts\\nare going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty\\ncharles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility\\nto give me any notice or of offering to take anything\\ni do not think they improve at all as neighbours  we see nothing of them\\nand this is really an instance of gross inattention  charles joins me\\nin love and everything proper  yours affectionately\\n\\n  mary m\\n\\ni am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has\\njust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sorethroat\\nvery much about  i dare say i shall catch it and my sorethroats\\nyou know are always worse than anybodys\\n\\n\\nso ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope\\ncontaining nearly as much more\\n\\n\\ni kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa\\nbore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal\\nto add  in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday\\noffering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed\\naddressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to\\nmake my letter as long as i like  the admiral does not seem very ill\\nand i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants\\ni shall be truly glad to have them back again  our neighbourhood\\ncannot spare such a pleasant family  but now for louisa\\ni have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little\\nshe and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening\\nwe went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised\\nnot to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited\\nas well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason\\nneither more nor less than his being in love with louisa\\nand not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer\\nfrom mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her\\nbefore she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville\\ntrue upon my honour  are not you astonished  i shall be surprised\\nat least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did\\nmrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter\\nwe are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her\\nmarrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter\\nand mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick\\nis expected today  mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal\\non his poor sisters account but however louisa is a great favourite\\nwith both  indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her\\nthe better for having nursed her  charles wonders what captain wentworth\\nwill say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa\\ni never could see anything of it  and this is the end you see\\nof captain benwicks being supposed to be an admirer of yours\\nhow charles could take such a thing into his head was always\\nincomprehensible to me  i hope he will be more agreeable now\\ncertainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better\\nthan marrying among the hayters\\n\\n\\nmary need not have feared her sisters being in any degree prepared\\nfor the news  she had never in her life been more astonished\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove  it was almost too wonderful\\nfor belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain\\nin the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions\\nof the moment  happily for her they were not many  sir walter\\nwanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses\\nand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath\\nas it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had\\nlittle curiosity beyond\\n\\nhow is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer\\nand pray what brings the crofts to bath\\n\\nthey come on the admirals account  he is thought to be gouty\\n\\ngout and decrepitude said sir walter  poor old gentleman\\n\\nhave they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth\\n\\ni do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral crofts\\ntime of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance\\nin such a place as this\\n\\ni suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft\\nwill be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall\\nelizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place\\n\\noh no i think not  situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins\\nwe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance\\nshe might not approve  if we were not related it would not signify\\nbut as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours\\nwe had better leave the crofts to find their own level\\nthere are several oddlooking men walking about here who\\ni am told are sailors  the crofts will associate with them\\n\\nthis was sir walter and elizabeths share of interest in the letter\\nwhen mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention\\nin an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys\\nanne was at liberty\\n\\nin her own room she tried to comprehend it  well might charles wonder\\nhow captain wentworth would feel  perhaps he had quitted the field\\nhad given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her\\nshe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything\\nakin to ill usage between him and his friend  she could not endure\\nthat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly\\n\\ncaptain benwick and louisa musgrove  the highspirited\\njoyoustalking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking\\nfeeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything\\nthat would not suit the other  their minds most dissimilar\\nwhere could have been the attraction  the answer soon presented itself\\nit had been in situation  they had been thrown together several weeks\\nthey had been living in the same small family party  since henriettas\\ncoming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other\\nand louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state\\nand captain benwick was not inconsolable  that was a point which anne\\nhad not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing\\nthe same conclusion as mary from the present course of events\\nthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some\\ndawning of tenderness toward herself  she did not mean however\\nto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary\\nmight have allowed  she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing\\nyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have\\nreceived the same compliment  he had an affectionate heart\\nhe must love somebody\\n\\nshe saw no reason against their being happy  louisa had fine\\nnaval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike\\nhe would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast\\nfor scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already\\nof course they had fallen in love over poetry  the idea of\\nlouisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste\\nand sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt\\nof its being so  the day at lyme the fall from the cobb\\nmight influence her health her nerves her courage her character to\\nthe end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have\\ninfluenced her fate\\n\\nthe conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible\\nof captain wentworths merits could be allowed to prefer another man\\nthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder\\nand if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing\\nto be regretted  no it was not regret which made annes heart\\nbeat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks\\nwhen she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free\\nshe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate\\nthey were too much like joy senseless joy\\n\\nshe longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place\\nit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them\\nthe visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove\\nwas mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile\\n\\nthe crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street\\nperfectly to sir walters satisfaction  he was not at all ashamed\\nof the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more\\nabout the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him\\n\\nthe crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for\\nand considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form\\nand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure\\nthey brought with them their country habit of being almost always together\\nhe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft\\nseemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk\\nfor her life to do him good  anne saw them wherever she went\\nlady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning\\nand she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them\\nknowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture\\nof happiness to her  she always watched them as long as she could\\ndelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of\\nas they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted\\nto see the admirals hearty shake of the hand when he encountered\\nan old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation\\nwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft\\nlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her\\n\\nanne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself\\nbut it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days\\nafter the crofts arrival it suited her best to leave her friend\\nor her friends carriage in the lower part of the town\\nand return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street\\nshe had the good fortune to meet with the admiral  he was standing\\nby himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him\\nin earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have\\npassed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him\\nbefore she could catch his notice  when he did perceive and\\nacknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness\\nand good humour  ha is it you  thank you thank you\\nthis is treating me like a friend  here i am you see\\nstaring at a picture  i can never get by this shop without stopping\\nbut what a thing here is by way of a boat  do look at it\\ndid you ever see the like  what queer fellows your fine painters must be\\nto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless\\nold cockleshell as that  and yet here are two gentlemen\\nstuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks\\nand mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment\\nwhich they certainly must be  i wonder where that boat was built\\nlaughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it\\nwell

tell you the whole story\\nanother time  there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson\\nlook he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife\\nah the peace has come too soon for that younker  poor old sir archibald\\nhow do you like bath miss elliot  it suits us very well\\nwe are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets\\nfull of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat\\nand then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings\\nand draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at kellynch\\nay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal\\nwe do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you\\nfor putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth\\nthe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way\\n\\nwhen they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again\\nfor what he had to communicate  she hoped when clear of milsom street\\nto have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait\\nfor the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had\\ngained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was\\nnot really mrs croft she must let him have his own way\\nas soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began\\n\\nwell now you shall hear something that will surprise you\\nbut first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady\\ni am going to talk about  that young lady you know that we have\\nall been so concerned for  the miss musgrove that all this has been\\nhappening to  her christian name  i always forget her christian name\\n\\nanne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really\\ndid but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa\\n\\nay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name  i wish young ladies\\nhad not such a number of fine christian names  i should never be out\\nif they were all sophys or something of that sort  well\\nthis miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick\\nhe was courting her week after week  the only wonder was\\nwhat they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came\\nthen indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain\\nwas set to right  but even then there was something odd in their\\nway of going on  instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth\\nand then he went off to see edward  when we came back from minehead\\nhe was gone down to edwards and there he has been ever since\\nwe have seen nothing of him since november  even sophy could\\nnot understand it  but now the matter has take the strangest turn of all\\nfor this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being\\nto marry frederick is to marry james benwick  you know james benwick\\n\\na little  i am a little acquainted with captain benwick\\n\\nwell she is to marry him  nay most likely they are married already\\nfor i do not know what they should wait for\\n\\ni thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne\\nand i understand that he bears an excellent character\\n\\noh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick\\nhe is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are\\nbad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of\\nan excellent goodhearted fellow i assure you a very active\\nzealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps\\nfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justice\\n\\nindeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit\\nfrom captain benwicks manners  i thought them particularly pleasing\\nand i will answer for it they would generally please\\n\\nwell well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too\\npiano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality\\nsophy and i cannot help thinking fredericks manners better than his\\nthere is something about frederick more to our taste\\n\\nanne was caught  she had only meant to oppose the too common idea\\nof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other\\nnot at all to represent captain benwicks manners as the very best\\nthat could possibly be and after a little hesitation\\nshe was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison\\nof the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with\\n\\nand the thing is certainly true  it is not a mere bit of gossip\\nwe have it from frederick himself  his sister had a letter\\nfrom him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it\\nin a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross\\ni fancy they are all at uppercross\\n\\nthis was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore\\ni hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain\\nwentworths letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy\\nit did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him\\nand louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out\\non each side equally and without violence  i hope his letter\\ndoes not breathe the spirit of an illused man\\n\\nnot at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur\\nfrom beginning to end\\n\\nanne looked down to hide her smile\\n\\nno no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has\\ntoo much spirit for that  if the girl likes another man better\\nit is very fit she should have him\\n\\ncertainly  but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing\\nin captain wentworths manner of writing to make you suppose\\nhe thinks himself illused by his friend which might appear\\nyou know without its being absolutely said  i should be very sorry\\nthat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick\\nshould be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort\\n\\nyes yes i understand you  but there is nothing at all of that nature\\nin the letter  he does not give the least fling at benwick\\ndoes not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own\\nfor wondering at it  no you would not guess from his way of writing\\nthat he had ever thought of this miss whats her name for himself\\nhe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is\\nnothing very unforgiving in that i think\\n\\nanne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant\\nto convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther\\nshe therefore satisfied herself with commonplace remarks or quiet\\nattention and the admiral had it all his own way\\n\\npoor frederick said he at last  now he must begin all over again\\nwith somebody else  i think we must get him to bath  sophy must write\\nand beg him to come to bath  here are pretty girls enough i am sure\\nit would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other\\nmiss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson\\ndo not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 19\\n\\n\\nwhile admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing\\nhis wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth\\nwas already on his way thither  before mrs croft had written\\nhe was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him\\n\\nmr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay  they were\\nin milsom street  it began to rain not much but enough to\\nmake shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it\\nvery desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being\\nconveyed home in lady dalrymples carriage which was seen waiting\\nat a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore\\nturned into mollands while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple\\nto request her assistance  he soon joined them again successful\\nof course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home\\nand would call for them in a few minutes\\n\\nher ladyships carriage was a barouche and did not hold\\nmore than four with any comfort  miss carteret was with her mother\\nconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation\\nfor all the three camden place ladies  there could be no doubt\\nas to miss elliot  whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none\\nbut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility\\nbetween the other two  the rain was a mere trifle and anne was\\nmost sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot  but the rain was also\\na mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all\\nand her boots were so thick much thicker than miss annes\\nand in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left\\nto walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them\\nwith a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were\\nobliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay\\nhad a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal\\nthat his cousin annes boots were rather the thickest\\n\\nit was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party\\nin the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne\\nas she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly\\ncaptain wentworth walking down the street\\n\\nher start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that\\nshe was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable\\nand absurd  for a few minutes she saw nothing before her\\nit was all confusion  she was lost and when she had scolded\\nback her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage\\nand mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street\\non a commission of mrs clays\\n\\nshe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door\\nshe wanted to see if it rained  why was she to suspect herself\\nof another motive  captain wentworth must be out of sight\\nshe left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always\\nso much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other\\nof being worse than it was  she would see if it rained\\nshe was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of\\ncaptain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies\\nevidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined\\na little below milsom street  he was more obviously struck\\nand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before\\nhe looked quite red  for the first time since their renewed acquaintance\\nshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two\\nshe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments\\nall the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects\\nof strong surprise were over with her  still however\\nshe had enough to feel  it was agitation pain pleasure\\na something between delight and misery\\n\\nhe spoke to her and then turned away  the character of his manner\\nwas embarrassment  she could not have called it either cold or friendly\\nor anything so certainly as embarrassed\\n\\nafter a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again\\nmutual enquiries on common subjects passed  neither of them probably\\nmuch the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible\\nof his being less at ease than formerly  they had by dint of being\\nso very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable\\nportion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now\\ntime had changed him or louisa had changed him  there was consciousness\\nof some sort or other  he looked very well not as if he had been\\nsuffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross\\nof the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look\\nof his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was\\ncaptain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was\\n\\nit did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth\\nwould not know him  she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him\\nthat there was complete internal recognition on each side\\nshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance\\nexpecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away\\nwith unalterable coldness\\n\\nlady dalrymples carriage for which miss elliot was growing\\nvery impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it\\nit was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay\\nand a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd\\nin the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey\\nmiss elliot  at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but\\nby the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off\\nand captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne\\nand by manner rather than words was offering his services to her\\n\\ni am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them\\nthe carriage would not accommodate so many  i walk  i prefer walking\\n\\nbut it rains\\n\\noh very little  nothing that i regard\\n\\nafter a moments pause he said  though i came only yesterday\\ni have equipped myself properly for bath already you see\\npointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it\\nif you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent\\nto let me get you a chair\\n\\nshe was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating\\nher conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present\\nand adding i am only waiting for mr elliot  he will be here in a moment\\ni am sure\\n\\nshe had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in\\ncaptain wentworth recollected him perfectly  there was no difference\\nbetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme\\nadmiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner\\nof the privileged relation and friend  he came in with eagerness\\nappeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay\\nwas grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away\\nwithout further loss of time and before the rain increased\\nand in another moment they walked off together her arm under his\\na gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you\\nbeing all that she had time for as she passed away\\n\\nas soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworths party\\nbegan talking of them\\n\\nmr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy\\n\\noh no that is clear enough  one can guess what will happen there\\nhe is always with them half lives in the family i believe\\nwhat a very goodlooking man\\n\\nyes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises\\nsays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with\\n\\nshe is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes\\nto look at her  it is not the fashion to say so but i confess\\ni admire her more than her sister\\n\\noh so do i\\n\\nand so do i  no comparison  but the men are all wild after miss elliot\\nanne is too delicate for them\\n\\nanne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have\\nwalked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word\\nshe had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing\\ncould exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects\\nwere principally such as were wont to be always interesting\\npraise warm just and discriminating of lady russell\\nand insinuations highly rational against mrs clay  but just now\\nshe could think only of captain wentworth  she could not understand\\nhis present feelings whether he were really suffering much\\nfrom disappointment or not and till that point were settled\\nshe could not be quite herself\\n\\nshe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas\\nshe must confess to herself that she was not wise yet\\n\\nanother circumstance very essential for her to know was how long\\nhe meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not\\nrecollect it  he might be only passing through  but it was more probable\\nthat he should be come to stay  in that case so liable as every body was\\nto meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood\\nsee him somewhere  would she recollect him  how would it all be\\n\\nshe had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove\\nwas to marry captain benwick  it had cost her something to encounter\\nlady russells surprise and now if she were by any chance\\nto be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge\\nof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him\\n\\nthe following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour\\nin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last\\nin returning down pulteney street she distinguished him\\non the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view\\nthe greater part of the street  there were many other men about him\\nmany groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him\\nshe looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea\\nof her recognising him so soon as she did herself  no it was\\nnot to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they\\nwere nearly opposite  she looked at her however from time to time\\nanxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out\\nthough not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew\\nwas unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of\\nlady russells eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him\\nof her being in short intently observing him  she could thoroughly\\ncomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russells mind\\nthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment\\nshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him\\nand in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him\\nof one personal grace\\n\\nat last lady russell drew back her head  now how would she\\nspeak of him\\n\\nyou will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long\\nbut i was looking after some windowcurtains which lady alicia and\\nmrs frankland were telling me of last night  they described\\nthe drawingroom windowcurtains of one of the houses on this\\nside of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest\\nand best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number\\nand i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess\\ni can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description\\n\\nanne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain\\neither at her friend or herself  the part which provoked her most\\nwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have\\nlost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them\\n\\na day or two passed without producing anything  the theatre or the rooms\\nwhere he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough\\nfor the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the\\nelegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting\\nmore and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation\\nsick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because\\nher strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening\\nit was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple\\nof course they must attend  it was really expected to be a good one\\nand captain wentworth was very fond of music  if she could only have\\na few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should\\nbe satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over\\ncourage if the opportunity occurred  elizabeth had turned from him\\nlady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened\\nby these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention\\n\\nshe had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her\\nbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off\\nwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow\\nmrs smith gave a most goodhumoured acquiescence\\n\\nby all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come\\nwho is your party\\n\\nanne named them all  mrs smith made no reply but when she was\\nleaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch\\nwell i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me\\ntomorrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding\\nthat i may not have many more visits from you\\n\\nanne was startled and confused but after standing in a moments suspense\\nwas obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 20\\n\\n\\nsir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest\\nof all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymple\\nmust be waited for they took their station by one of the fires\\nin the octagon room  but hardly were they so settled when the door\\nopened again and captain wentworth walked in alone  anne was\\nthe nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke\\nhe was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do\\nbrought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries\\nin return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground\\ntheir being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothing\\nof their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed\\nright to be done\\n\\nwhile they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth\\ncaught her ear  she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject\\nand on captain wentworths making a distant bow she comprehended\\nthat her father had judged so well as to give him that\\nsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time\\nby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself\\nthis though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet\\nbetter than nothing and her spirits improved\\n\\nafter talking however of the weather and bath and the concert\\ntheir conversation began to flag and so little was said at last\\nthat she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not\\nhe seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit\\nwith a little smile a little glow he said\\n\\ni have hardly seen you since our day at lyme  i am afraid you must have\\nsuffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you\\nat the time\\n\\nshe assured him that she had not\\n\\nit was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he\\npassed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still\\ntoo painful but in a moment half smiling again added\\nthe day has produced some effects however has had some consequences\\nwhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightful\\nwhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be\\nthe properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea\\nof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery\\n\\ncertainly i could have none  but it appearsi should hope it would be\\na very happy match  there are on both sides good principles\\nand good temper\\n\\nyes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think\\nends the resemblance  with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice\\nover every circumstance in favour of it  they have no difficulties\\nto contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays\\nthe musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly\\nonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughters comfort\\nall this is much very much in favour of their happiness\\nmore than perhaps\\n\\nhe stopped  a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him\\nsome taste of that emotion which was reddening annes cheeks\\nand fixing her eyes on the ground  after clearing his throat however\\nhe proceeded thus\\n\\ni confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity\\nand in a point no less essential than mind  i regard louisa musgrove\\nas a very amiable sweettempered girl and not deficient in understanding\\nbut benwick is something more  he is a clever man a reading man\\nand i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her\\nwith some surprise  had it been the effect of gratitude\\nhad he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him\\nit would have been another thing  but i have no reason to suppose it so\\nit seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous\\nuntaught feeling on his side and this surprises me  a man like him\\nin his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken\\nfanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her\\nwas indeed attachment  a man does not recover from such\\na devotion of the heart to such a woman  he ought not he does not\\n\\neither from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered\\nor from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who\\nin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered\\nand in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless\\nslam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through\\nhad distinguished every word was struck gratified confused\\nand beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things\\nin a moment  it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject\\nand yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking\\nand having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated\\nso far as to say\\n\\nyou were a good while at lyme i think\\n\\nabout a fortnight  i could not leave it till louisas doing well\\nwas quite ascertained  i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief\\nto be soon at peace  it had been my doing solely mine\\nshe would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak\\nthe country round lyme is very fine  i walked and rode a great deal\\nand the more i saw the more i found to admire\\n\\ni should very much like to see lyme again said anne\\n\\nindeed  i should not have supposed that you could have found\\nanything in lyme to inspire such a feeling  the horror and distress\\nyou were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits\\ni should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been\\nstrong disgust\\n\\nthe last hours were certainly very painful replied anne\\nbut when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure\\none does not love a place the less for having suffered in it\\nunless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was\\nby no means the case at lyme  we were only in anxiety and distress\\nduring the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal\\nof enjoyment  so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little\\nthat every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty\\nat lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections\\naltogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable\\n\\nas she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared\\nfor whom they were waiting  lady dalrymple lady dalrymple\\nwas the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible\\nwith anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward\\nto meet her  lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot\\nand colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant\\nadvanced into the room  the others joined them and it was\\na group in which anne found herself also necessarily included\\nshe was divided from captain wentworth  their interesting\\nalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time\\nbut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on\\nshe had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings\\ntowards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of\\nand she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful\\ncivilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations\\nshe was in good humour with all  she had received ideas which\\ndisposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one\\nas being less happy than herself\\n\\nthe delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back\\nfrom the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw\\nthat he was gone  she was just in time to see him turn into\\nthe concert room  he was gone he had disappeared she felt\\na moments regret  but they should meet again  he would look for her\\nhe would find her out before the evening were over and at present\\nperhaps it was as well to be asunder  she was in need of\\na little interval for recollection\\n\\nupon lady russells appearance soon afterwards the whole party\\nwas collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves\\nand proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence\\nin their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers\\nand disturb as many people as they could\\n\\nvery very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in\\nelizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back\\nof the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for\\nwhich did not seem within her reach and annebut it would be\\nan insult to the nature of annes felicity to draw any comparison\\nbetween it and her sisters the origin of one all selfish vanity\\nof the other all generous attachment\\n\\nanne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room\\nher happiness was from within  her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed\\nbut she knew nothing about it  she was thinking only of\\nthe last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took\\na hasty range over it  his choice of subjects his expressions\\nand still more his manner and look had been such as she could see\\nin only one light  his opinion of louisa musgroves inferiority\\nan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder\\nat captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment\\nsentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes\\nand more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had\\na heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance\\nwere no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship\\nand regard but by the tenderness of the past  yes some share of\\nthe tenderness of the past  she could not contemplate the change\\nas implying less  he must love her\\n\\nthese were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied\\nand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation\\nand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him\\nwithout even trying to discern him  when their places were determined on\\nand they were all properly arranged she looked round to see\\nif he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not\\nher eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening\\nshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way\\n\\nthe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches\\nanne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well\\nwith the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her\\nmiss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object\\nof colonel walliss gallantry was quite contented\\n\\nannes mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment\\nof the evening it was just occupation enough  she had feelings for\\nthe tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific\\nand patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better\\nat least during the first act  towards the close of it\\nin the interval succeeding an italian song she explained\\nthe words of the song to mr elliot  they had a concert bill between them\\n\\nthis said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words\\nfor certainly the sense of an italian lovesong must not be talked of\\nbut it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend\\nto understand the language  i am a very poor italian scholar\\n\\nyes yes i see you are  i see you know nothing of the matter\\nyou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight\\nthese inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear\\ncomprehensible elegant english  you need not say anything more\\nof your ignorance  here is complete proof\\n\\ni will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be\\nexamined by a real proficient\\n\\ni have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long\\nreplied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot\\nand i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general\\nto be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished\\nfor modesty to be natural

to have been\\ndescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people\\nis irresistible and anne was all curiosity  she wondered\\nand questioned him eagerly but in vain  he delighted in being asked\\nbut he would not tell\\n\\nno no some time or other perhaps but not now  he would mention\\nno names now but such he could assure her had been the fact\\nhe had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot\\nas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited\\nthe warmest curiosity to know her\\n\\nanne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with\\npartiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford\\ncaptain wentworths brother  he might have been in mr elliots company\\nbut she had not courage to ask the question\\n\\nthe name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me\\nvery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared\\ni would breathe my wishes that the name might never

eyes fell on him\\nhis seemed to be withdrawn from her  it had that appearance\\nit seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she\\ndared observe he did not look again  but the performance\\nwas recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention\\nto the orchestra and look straight forward\\n\\nwhen she could give another glance he had moved away  he could not have\\ncome nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in\\nbut she would rather have caught his eye\\n\\nmr elliots speech too distressed her  she had no longer\\nany inclination to talk to him  she wished him not so near her\\n\\nthe first act was over  now she hoped for some beneficial change\\nand after a period of nothingsaying amongst the party some of them\\ndid decide on going in quest of tea  anne was one of the few who\\ndid not choose to move  she remained in her seat and so did lady russell\\nbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean\\nwhatever she might feel on lady russells account to shrink from\\nconversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity\\nshe was persuaded by lady russells countenance that she had seen him\\n\\nhe did not come however  anne sometimes fancied she discerned him\\nat a distance but he never came  the anxious interval\\nwore away unproductively  the others returned the room filled again\\nbenches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure\\nor of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give\\ndelight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed\\nto anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation\\nshe could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth\\nonce more without the interchange of one friendly look\\n\\nin resettling themselves there were now many changes the result of which\\nwas favourable for her  colonel wallis declined sitting down again\\nand mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner\\nnot to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals\\nand a little scheming of her own  anne was enabled to place herself\\nmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been before\\nmuch more within reach of a passerby  she could not do so\\nwithout comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles\\nbut still she did it and not with much happier effect\\nthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication\\nin her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench\\nbefore the concert closed\\n\\nsuch was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth\\nwas again in sight  she saw him not far off  he saw her too\\nyet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees\\ncame at last near enough to speak to her  she felt that something\\nmust be the matter  the change was indubitable  the difference\\nbetween his present air and what it had been in the octagon room\\nwas strikingly great  why was it  she thought of her father\\nof lady russell  could there have been any unpleasant glances\\nhe began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain\\nwentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing\\nand in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over\\nanne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so well\\nand yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance\\nimproved and he replied again with almost a smile  they talked\\nfor a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down\\ntowards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying\\nwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round\\nit came from mr elliot  he begged her pardon but she must be applied to\\nto explain italian again  miss carteret was very anxious to have\\na general idea of what was next to be sung  anne could not refuse\\nbut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit\\n\\na few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed\\nand when her own mistress again when able to turn and look\\nas she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth\\nin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell  he must wish her good night\\nhe was going he should get home as fast as he could\\n\\nis not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck\\nby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging\\n\\nno he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for\\nand he was gone directly\\n\\njealousy of mr elliot  it was the only intelligible motive\\ncaptain wentworth jealous of her affection  could she have believed it\\na week ago three hours ago  for a moment the gratification was exquisite\\nbut alas there were very different thoughts to succeed\\nhow was such jealousy to be quieted  how was the truth to reach him\\nhow in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations\\nwould he ever learn of her real sentiments  it was misery to think\\nof mr elliots attentions  their evil was incalculable\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 21\\n\\n\\nanne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise\\nof going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home\\nat the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid\\nmr elliot was almost a first object\\n\\nshe felt a great deal of goodwill towards him  in spite of\\nthe mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard\\nperhaps compassion  she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary\\ncircumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which\\nhe seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation\\nby his own sentiments by his early prepossession  it was altogether\\nvery extraordinary flattering but painful  there was much to regret\\nhow she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case\\nwas not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth\\nand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad\\nher affection would be his for ever  their union she believed\\ncould not divide her more from other men than their final separation\\n\\nprettier musings of highwrought love and eternal constancy\\ncould never have passed along the streets of bath than anne\\nwas sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings\\nit was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way\\n\\nshe was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning\\nparticularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her\\nthough it had been an appointment\\n\\nan account of the concert was immediately claimed and annes recollections\\nof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features\\nand make her rejoice to talk of it  all that she could tell\\nshe told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there\\nand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had\\nalready heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter\\nrather more of the general success and produce of the evening\\nthan anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars\\nof the company  everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath\\nwas well know by name to mrs smith\\n\\nthe little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths\\nopen to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed\\nthey never miss a concert\\n\\nyes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were\\nin the room\\n\\nthe ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties\\nwith the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them\\n\\ni do not know  i do not think they were\\n\\nold lady mary maclean  i need not ask after her  she never misses\\ni know and you must have seen her  she must have been in your own circle\\nfor as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur\\nround the orchestra of course\\n\\nno that was what i dreaded  it would have been very unpleasant to me\\nin every respect  but happily lady dalrymple always chooses\\nto be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is\\nfor hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen\\nvery little\\n\\noh you saw enough for your own amusement  i can understand\\nthere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd\\nand this you had  you were a large party in yourselves\\nand you wanted nothing beyond\\n\\nbut i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious\\nwhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about\\nthat the object only had been deficient\\n\\nno no you were better employed  you need not tell me that you\\nhad a pleasant evening  i see it in your eye  i perfectly see\\nhow the hours passed  that you had always something agreeable\\nto listen to  in the intervals of the concert it was conversation\\n\\nanne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye\\n\\nyes i do  your countenance perfectly informs me that you were\\nin company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable\\nin the world the person who interests you at this present time\\nmore than all the rest of the world put together\\n\\na blush overspread annes cheeks  she could say nothing\\n\\nand such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause\\ni hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness\\nin coming to me this morning  it is really very good of you\\nto come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands\\nupon your time\\n\\nanne heard nothing of this  she was still in the astonishment and\\nconfusion excited by her friends penetration unable to imagine\\nhow any report of captain wentworth could have reached her\\nafter another short silence\\n\\npray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me\\ndoes he know that i am in bath\\n\\nmr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised  a moments reflection\\nshewed her the mistake she had been under  she caught it instantaneously\\nand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added\\nmore composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot\\n\\ni have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely\\nbut it seems worn out now  it is a great while since we met\\n\\ni was not at all aware of this  you never mentioned it before\\nhad i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you\\n\\nto confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual\\nair of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have\\ni want you to talk about me to mr elliot  i want your interest with him\\nhe can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness\\nmy dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself\\nof course it is done\\n\\ni should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness\\nto be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect\\nthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot\\na greater right to influence him than is really the case\\ni am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion\\nyou must consider me only as mr elliots relation  if in that light\\nthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him\\ni beg you would not hesitate to employ me\\n\\nmrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said\\n\\ni have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon\\ni ought to have waited for official information  but now my dear\\nmiss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak\\nnext week  to be sure by next week i may be allowed to\\nthink it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on\\nmr elliots good fortune\\n\\nno replied anne nor next week nor next nor next\\ni assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of\\nwill be settled any week  i am not going to marry mr elliot\\ni should like to know why you imagine i am\\n\\nmrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled\\nshook her head and exclaimed\\n\\nnow how i do wish i understood you  how i do wish i knew\\nwhat you were at  i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel\\nwhen the right moment occurs  till it does come you know\\nwe women never mean to have anybody  it is a thing of course among us\\nthat every man is refused till he offers  but why should you be cruel\\nlet me plead for mypresent friend i cannot call him but for\\nmy former friend  where can you look for a more suitable match\\nwhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man\\nlet me recommend mr elliot  i am sure you hear nothing but good of him\\nfrom colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis\\n\\nmy dear mrs smith mr elliots wife has not been dead much above\\nhalf a year  he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses\\nto any one\\n\\noh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly\\nmr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him\\ndo not forget me when you are married thats all  let him know me to be\\na friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required\\nwhich it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements\\nof his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps\\nninetynine out of a hundred would do the same  of course\\nhe cannot be aware of the importance to me  well my dear miss elliot\\ni hope and trust you will be very happy  mr elliot has sense\\nto understand the value of such a woman  your peace will not be\\nshipwrecked as mine has been  you are safe in all worldly matters\\nand safe in his character  he will not be led astray he will not be\\nmisled by others to his ruin\\n\\nno said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin\\nhe seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open\\nto dangerous impressions  i consider him with great respect\\ni have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation\\nto do otherwise  but i have not known him long and he is not a man\\ni think to be known intimately soon  will not this manner\\nof speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me\\nsurely this must be calm enough  and upon my word he is nothing to me\\nshould he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine\\nhe has any thought of doing i shall not accept him  i assure you\\ni shall not  i assure you mr elliot had not the share which\\nyou have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert\\nof last night might afford  not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that\\n\\nshe stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much\\nbut less would hardly have been sufficient  mrs smith would hardly\\nhave believed so soon in mr elliots failure but from the perception\\nof there being a somebody else  as it was she instantly submitted\\nand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne\\neager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith\\nshould have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have\\nreceived the idea or from whom she could have heard it\\n\\ndo tell me how it first came into your head\\n\\nit first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much\\nyou were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing\\nin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you\\nand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you\\nin the same way  but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago\\n\\nand has it indeed been spoken of\\n\\ndid you observe the woman who opened the door to you when\\nyou called yesterday\\n\\nno  was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid  i observed\\nno one in particular\\n\\nit was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who bythebye\\nhad a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way\\nto let you in  she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday\\nand she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot\\nshe had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority\\nshe sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history\\nthe whole history repeated anne laughing  she could not make\\na very long history i think of one such little article\\nof unfounded news\\n\\nmrs smith said nothing\\n\\nbut continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having\\nthis claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you\\nin any way that i could  shall i mention to him your being in bath\\nshall i take any message\\n\\nno i thank you  no certainly not  in the warmth of the moment\\nand under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured\\nto interest you in some circumstances but not now  no i thank you\\ni have nothing to trouble you with\\n\\ni think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years\\n\\ni did\\n\\nnot before he was married i suppose\\n\\nyes he was not married when i knew him first\\n\\nandwere you much acquainted\\n\\nintimately\\n\\nindeed  then do tell me what he was at that time of life\\ni have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man\\nwas he at all such as he appears now\\n\\ni have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smiths answer\\ngiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther\\nand anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity\\nthey were both silent  mrs smith very thoughtful  at last\\n\\ni beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her\\nnatural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers\\ni have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do\\ni have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you\\nthere were many things to be taken into the account  one hates\\nto be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief\\neven the smooth surface of familyunion seems worth preserving\\nthough there may be nothing durable beneath  however i have determined\\ni think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted\\nwith mr elliots real character  though i fully believe that\\nat present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him\\nthere is no saying what may happen  you might some time or other\\nbe differently affected towards him  hear the truth therefore\\nnow while you are unprejudiced  mr elliot is a man without heart\\nor conscience a designing wary coldblooded being who thinks\\nonly of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty\\nof any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without\\nrisk of his general character  he has no feeling for others\\nthose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin\\nhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction\\nhe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion\\noh he is black at heart hollow and black\\n\\nannes astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause\\nand in a calmer manner she added\\n\\nmy expressions startle you  you must allow for an injured angry woman\\nbut i will try to command myself  i will not abuse him\\ni will only tell you what i have found him  facts shall speak\\nhe was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him\\nand thought him as good as himself  the intimacy had been formed\\nbefore our marriage  i found them most intimate friends and i too\\nbecame excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained\\nthe highest opinion of him  at nineteen you know one does not\\nthink very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others\\nand much more agreeable than most others and we were almost\\nalways together  we were principally in town living in very good style\\nhe was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one\\nhe had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do\\nto support the appearance of a gentleman  he had always a home\\nwith us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother\\nmy poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world\\nwould have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse\\nwas open to him i know that he often assisted him\\n\\nthis must have been about that very period of mr elliots life\\nsaid anne which has always excited my particular curiosity\\nit must have been about the same time that he became known to\\nmy father and sister  i never knew him myself i only heard of him\\nbut there was a something in his conduct then with regard to\\nmy father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage\\nwhich i never could quite reconcile with present times  it seemed\\nto announce a different sort of man\\n\\ni know it all i know it all cried mrs smith  he had been\\nintroduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him\\nbut i heard him speak of them for ever  i know he was invited\\nand encouraged and i know he did not choose to go  i can satisfy you\\nperhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage\\ni knew all about it at the time  i was privy to all the fors and againsts\\ni was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though\\ni did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society\\nindeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards\\nor at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer\\nany question you may wish to put\\n\\nnay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her\\ni have always understood they were not a happy couple  but i should\\nlike to know why at that time of his life he should slight\\nmy fathers acquaintance as he did  my father was certainly disposed\\nto take very kind and proper notice of him  why did mr elliot draw back\\n\\nmr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life\\nhad one object in view  to make his fortune and by a rather quicker\\nprocess than the law  he was determined to make it by marriage\\nhe was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage\\nand i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course\\ni cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities\\nand invitations were designing a match between the heir\\nand the young lady and it was impossible that such a match\\nshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independence\\nthat was his motive for drawing back i can assure you\\nhe told me the whole story  he had no concealments with me\\nit was curious that having just left you behind me in bath\\nmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin\\nand that through him i should be continually hearing of your father\\nand sister  he described one miss elliot and i thought\\nvery affectionately of the other\\n\\nperhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes\\nspoke of me to mr elliot\\n\\nto be sure i did very often  i used to boast of my own anne elliot\\nand vouch for your being a very different creature from\\n\\nshe checked herself just in time\\n\\nthis accounts for something which mr elliot said last night\\ncried anne  this explains it  i found he had been used to hear of me\\ni could not comprehend how  what wild imaginations one forms where\\ndear self is concerned  how sure to be mistaken  but i beg your pardon\\ni have interrupted you  mr elliot married then completely for money\\nthe circumstances probably which first opened your eyes\\nto his character\\n\\nmrs smith hesitated a little here  oh those things are too common\\nwhen one lives in the world a man or womans marrying for money\\nis too common to strike one as it ought  i was very young\\nand associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless\\ngay set without any strict rules of conduct  we lived for enjoyment\\ni think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me\\nother notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible\\nin what mr elliot was doing  to do the best for himself\\npassed as a duty\\n\\nbut was not she a very low woman\\n\\nyes which i objected to but he would not regard  money money\\nwas all that he wanted  her father was a grazier her grandfather\\nhad been a butcher but that was all nothing  she was a fine woman\\nhad had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins\\nthrown by chance into mr elliots company and fell in love with him\\nand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side\\nwith respect to her birth  all his caution was spent in being secured\\nof the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself\\ndepend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation\\nin life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it\\nhis chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour\\nof the family he held as cheap as dirt  i have often heard him declare\\nthat if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his\\nfor fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included\\nbut i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say\\non that subject  it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof\\nfor what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof\\n\\nindeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne  you have asserted\\nnothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago\\nthis is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe\\ni am more curious to know why he should be so different now\\n\\nbut for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary\\nstay  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of\\ngoing yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box\\nwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closet\\n\\nanne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired\\nthe box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it\\nas she unlocked it said\\n\\nthis is full of papers belonging to him to my husband\\na small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him\\nthe letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him\\nbefore our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine\\nbut he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things\\nand when i came to examine his papers i found it with others\\nstill more trivial from different people scattered here and there\\nwhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed\\nhere it is i would not burn it because being even then very little\\nsatisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document\\nof former intimacy  i have now another motive for being glad\\nthat i can produce it\\n\\nthis was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells\\nand dated from london as far back as july 1803 \\n\\ndear smithi have received yours  your kindness almost overpowers me\\ni wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have\\nlived threeandtwenty years in the world and have seen none like it\\nat present believe me i have no need of your services\\nbeing in cash again  give me joy  i have got rid of sir walter and miss\\nthey are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them\\nthis summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor\\nto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer\\nthe baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again\\nhe is quite fool enough  if he does however they will leave me in peace\\nwhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion  he is worse\\nthan last year\\n\\ni wish i had any name but elliot  i am sick of it  the name of walter\\ni can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me\\nwith my second w again meaning for the rest of my life\\nto be only yours trulywm elliot\\n\\nsuch a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow\\nand mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said\\n\\nthe language i know is highly disrespectful  though i have forgot\\nthe exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning\\nbut it shows you the man  mark his professions to my poor husband\\ncan any thing be stronger\\n\\nanne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification\\nof finding such words applied to her father  she was obliged to recollect\\nthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour\\nthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies\\nthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of others\\nbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letter\\nwhich she had been meditating over and say\\n\\nthank you  this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing\\nyou were saying  but why be acquainted with us now\\n\\ni can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling\\n\\ncan you really\\n\\nyes  i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago\\nand i will shew him as he is now  i cannot produce written proof again\\nbut i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what\\nhe is now wanting and what he is now doing  he is no hypocrite now\\nhe truly wants to marry you  his present attentions to your family\\nare very sincere  quite from the heart  i will give you my authority\\nhis friend colonel wallis\\n\\ncolonel wallis you are acquainted with him\\n\\nno  it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that\\nit takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence  the stream\\nis as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings\\nis easily moved away  mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis\\nof his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be\\nin himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character\\nbut colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom\\nhe tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her\\nshe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all\\nto her nurse and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you\\nvery naturally brings it all to me  on monday evening my good friend\\nmrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings\\nwhen i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was\\nnot romancing so much as you supposed\\n\\nmy dear mrs smith your authority is deficient  this will not do\\nmr elliots having any views on me will not in the least account\\nfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father\\nthat was all prior to my coming to bath  i found them on\\nthe most friendly terms when i arrived\\n\\ni know you did i know it all perfectly but\\n\\nindeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information\\nin such a line  facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands\\nof so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another\\ncan hardly have much truth left\\n\\nonly give me a hearing  you will soon be able to judge of\\nthe general credit due by listening to some particulars\\nwhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm\\nnobody supposes that you were his first inducement  he had seen you\\nindeed before he came to bath and admired you but without\\nknowing it to be you  so says my historian at least  is this true\\ndid he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west\\nto use her own words without knowing it to be you\\n\\nhe certainly did  so far it is very true  at lyme\\ni happened to be at lyme\\n\\nwell continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit\\ndue to the establishment of the first point asserted  he saw you then\\nat lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased\\nto meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot\\nand from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive\\nin his visits there  but there was another and an earlier\\nwhich i will now explain  if there is anything in my story which you know\\nto be either false or improbable stop me  my account states\\nthat your sisters friend the lady now staying with you\\nwhom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter\\nas long ago as september in short when they first came themselves\\nand has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating\\nhandsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation\\nand manner as to give a general idea among sir walters acquaintance\\nof her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise\\nthat miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger\\n\\nhere mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say\\nand she continued\\n\\nthis was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family\\nlong before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye\\nupon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then\\nvisit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest\\nin watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath\\nfor a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas\\ncolonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things\\nand the reports beginning to prevail  now you are to understand\\nthat time had worked a very material change in mr elliots opinions\\nas to the value of a baronetcy  upon all points of blood and connexion\\nhe is a completely altered man  having long had as much money\\nas he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice\\nor indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness\\nupon the consequence he is heir to  i thought it coming on\\nbefore our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling\\nhe cannot bear the idea of not being sir william  you may guess\\ntherefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be\\nvery agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution\\nof coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here\\nfor a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance\\nand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means\\nof ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady\\nif he found it material  this was agreed upon between the two friends\\nas the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist\\nin every way that he could  he was to be introduced and mrs wallis\\nwas to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced\\nmr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven\\nas you know and readmitted into the family and there it was\\nhis constant object and his only object till your arrival\\nadded another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay\\nhe omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way\\ncalled at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject\\nyou can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide\\nperhaps may recollect what you have seen him do\\n\\nyes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with\\nwhat i have known or could imagine  there is always something offensive\\nin the details of cunning  the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity\\nmust ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me\\ni know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot\\nwho would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied\\ni have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared\\ni should like to know his present opinion as to the probability\\nof the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger\\nto be lessening or not\\n\\nlessening i understand replied mrs smith  he thinks mrs clay\\nafraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed\\nas she might do in his absence  but since he must be absent\\nsome time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure\\nwhile she holds her present influence  mrs wallis has an amusing idea\\nas nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles\\nwhen you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay\\na scheme worthy of mrs walliss understanding by all accounts\\nbut my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it  why to be sure\\nmaam said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else\\nand indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart\\nis a very strenuous opposer of sir walters making a second match\\nshe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know\\nand since self will intrude who can say that she may not have\\nsome flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through\\nmrs walliss recommendation\\n\\ni am very glad to know all this said anne after a little\\nthoughtfulness  it will be more painful to me in some respects\\nto be in company with him but i shall know better what to do\\nmy line of conduct will be more direct  mr elliot is evidently\\na disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had\\nany better principle to guide him than selfishness\\n\\nbut mr elliot was not done with  mrs smith had been carried away\\nfrom her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest\\nof her own family concerns how much had been originally implied\\nagainst him but her attention was now called to the explanation\\nof those first hints and she listened to a recital which\\nif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith\\nproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her\\nvery deficient both in justice and compassion\\n\\nshe learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired\\nby mr elliots marriage they had been as before always together\\nand mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune\\nmrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender\\nof throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income\\nhad never been equal to their style of living and that from the first\\nthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance\\nfrom his wifes account of him she could discern mr smith to have been\\na man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong\\nunderstanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him\\nled by him and probably despised by him  mr elliot raised by\\nhis marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification\\nof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself\\nfor with all his selfindulgence he had become a prudent man\\nand beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself\\nto be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friends\\nprobable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and\\nencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths\\naccordingly had been ruined\\n\\nthe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it\\nthey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship\\nof their friends and to prove that mr elliots had better not be tried\\nbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs\\nwas fully known  with a confidence in mr elliots regard\\nmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had\\nappointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act\\nand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her\\nin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such\\nas could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to\\nwithout corresponding indignation\\n\\nanne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to\\nurgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same\\nstern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and\\nunder a cold civility the same hardhearted indifference\\nto any of the evils it might bring on her  it was a dreadful picture\\nof ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments\\nthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse  she had a great deal\\nto listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae\\nof distress upon distress which in former conversations had been\\nmerely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence\\nanne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only\\nthe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friends\\nusual state of mind\\n\\nthere was one circumstance in the history of her grievances\\nof particular irritation  she had good reason to believe that\\nsome property of her husband in the west indies which had been\\nfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment\\nof its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures\\nand this property though not large would be enough to make\\nher comparatively rich  but there was nobody to stir in it\\nmr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself\\nequally disabled from personal exertion by her state of\\nbodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money\\nshe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel\\nand she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law\\nthis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means\\nto feel that she ought to be in better circumstances\\nthat a little trouble in the right place might do it\\nand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims\\nwas hard to bear\\n\\nit was on this point that she had hoped to engage annes good offices\\nwith mr elliot  she had previously in the anticipation\\nof their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it\\nbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature\\nsince he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred\\nthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman\\nhe loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest annes feelings\\nas far as the observances due to mr elliots character would allow\\nwhen annes refutation of the supposed engagement changed\\nthe face of everything and while it took from her the newformed hope\\nof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least\\nthe comfort of telling the whole story her own way\\n\\nafter listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but\\nexpress some surprise at mrs smiths having spoken of him so favourably\\nin the beginning of their conversation  she had seemed to recommend\\nand praise him\\n\\nmy dear was mrs smiths reply there was nothing else to be done\\ni considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet\\nhave made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him\\nthan if he had been your husband  my heart bled for you\\nas i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable\\nand with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless\\nhe was very unkind to his first wife  they were wretched together\\nbut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her\\ni was willing to hope that you must fare better\\n\\nanne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility\\nof having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea\\nof the misery which must have followed  it was just possible that\\nshe might have been persuaded by lady russell  and under such\\na supposition which would have been most miserable when time had\\ndisclosed all too late\\n\\nit was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived\\nand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference\\nwhich carried them through the greater part of the morning\\nwas that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend\\neverything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 22\\n\\n\\nanne went home to think over all that she had heard  in one point\\nher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot\\nthere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him  he stood as\\nopposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness\\nand the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief\\nhe might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed\\npity for him was all over  but this was the only point of relief\\nin every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward\\nshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend  she was concerned\\nfor the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling\\nfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister\\nand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing\\nhow to avert any one of them  she was most thankful for her own\\nknowledge of him  she had never considered herself as entitled to reward\\nfor not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was\\na reward indeed springing from it  mrs smith had been able to tell her\\nwhat no one else could have done  could the knowledge have\\nbeen extended through her family  but this was a vain idea\\nshe must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her\\nand having done her best wait the event with as much composure\\nas possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be\\nin that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell\\nin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself\\n\\n\\nshe found on reaching home that she had as she intended\\nescaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them\\na long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself\\nand felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening\\n\\ni had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth\\nwith affected carelessness but he gave so many hints\\nso mrs clay says at least\\n\\nindeed i do say it  i never saw anybody in my life spell harder\\nfor an invitation  poor man  i was really in pain for him\\nfor your hardhearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty\\n\\noh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game\\nto be soon overcome by a gentlemans hints  however when i found\\nhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father\\nthis morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit\\nan opportunity of bring him and sir walter together  they appear to\\nso much advantage in company with each other  each behaving so pleasantly\\nmr elliot looking up with so much respect\\n\\nquite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however\\nto turn her eyes towards anne  exactly like father and son\\ndear miss elliot may i not say father and son\\n\\noh i lay no embargo on any bodys words  if you will have such\\nideas  but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions\\nbeing beyond those of other men\\n\\nmy dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes\\nand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence\\n\\nwell my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him\\ni did invite him you know  i sent him away with smiles\\nwhen i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park\\nfor the whole day tomorrow i had compassion on him\\n\\nanne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew\\nsuch pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival\\nof the very person whose presence must really be interfering with\\nher prime object  it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate\\nthe sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging\\nplacid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license\\nof devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have\\ndone otherwise\\n\\nto anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room\\nand quite painful to have him approach and speak to her\\nshe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere\\nbut now she saw insincerity in everything  his attentive deference\\nto her father contrasted with his former language was odious\\nand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith\\nshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness\\nor the sound of his artificial good sentiments\\n\\nshe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke\\na remonstrance on his side  it was a great object to her to escape\\nall enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool\\nto him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace\\nas quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had\\nbeen gradually led along  she was accordingly more guarded\\nand more cool than she had been the night before\\n\\nhe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where\\nhe could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much\\nto be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken\\nhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary\\nto kindle his modest cousins vanity he found at least that it was\\nnot to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard\\namong the toocommanding claims of the others  he little surmised\\nthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest\\nbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct\\nwhich were least excusable\\n\\nshe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath\\nthe next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part\\nof two days  he was invited again to camden place the very evening of\\nhis return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain\\nit was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her\\nbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party\\nseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort\\nit was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised\\non her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources\\nof mortification preparing for them  mrs clays selfishness was\\nnot so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded\\nfor the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliots\\nsubtleties in endeavouring to prevent it\\n\\non friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell\\nand accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone\\ndirectly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out\\non some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which\\ndetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion\\nshe saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk\\nof spending the morning in rivers street\\n\\nvery well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love\\noh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me\\nand pretend i have read it through  i really cannot be plaguing myself\\nfor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out\\nlady russell quite bores one with her new publications\\nyou need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night\\ni used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her\\nat the concert  something so formal and arrange in her air\\nand she sits so upright  my best love of course\\n\\nand mine added sir walter  kindest regards  and you may say\\nthat i mean to call upon her soon  make a civil message\\nbut i shall only leave my card  morning visits are never fair\\nby women at her time of life who make themselves up so little\\nif she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen\\nbut last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately\\n\\nwhile her father spoke there was a knock at the door  who could it be\\nanne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot\\nwould have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off\\nafter the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard\\nand mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room\\n\\nsurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance\\nbut anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry\\nbut that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon\\nas it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived\\nwith an views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth\\nwere able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well\\nthey were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were\\nat the white hart  so much was pretty soon understood\\nbut till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into\\nthe other drawingroom and regaling themselves with her admiration\\nanne could not draw upon charless brain for a regular history\\nof their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints\\nof particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary\\nas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of\\n\\nshe then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta\\nand captain harville beside their two selves  he gave her a very plain\\nintelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw\\na great deal of most characteristic proceeding  the scheme\\nhad received its first impulse by captain harvilles wanting to\\ncome to bath on business  he had begun to talk of it a week ago\\nand by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed\\ncoming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it\\nvery much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear\\nto be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two\\neverything seemed to be in suspense or at an end  but then\\nit had been taken up by his father and mother  his mother had\\nsome old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought\\na good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy weddingclothes\\nfor herself and her sister and in short it ended in being\\nhis mothers party that everything might be comfortable and easy\\nto captain harville and he and mary were included in it\\nby way of general convenience  they had arrived late the night before\\nmrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with\\nmr musgrove and louisa at uppercross\\n\\nannes only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough\\nfor henriettas weddingclothes to be talked of  she had imagined\\nsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent\\nthe marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that\\nvery recently since marys last letter to herself charles hayter\\nhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth\\nwho could not possibly claim it under many years and that\\non the strength of his present income with almost a certainty\\nof something more permanent long before the term in question\\nthe two families had consented to the young peoples wishes\\nand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months\\nquite as soon as louisas  and a very good living it was\\ncharles added  only fiveandtwenty miles from uppercross\\nand in a very fine country   fine part of dorsetshire\\nin the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom\\nsurrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous\\nthan the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get\\na special recommendation  not that he will value it as he ought\\nhe observed charles is too cool about sporting thats the worst of him\\n\\ni am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad\\nthat this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve\\nequally well and who have always been such good friends\\nthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other\\nthat they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort\\ni hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both\\n\\noh yes  my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer\\nbut he has no other fault to find  money you know coming down with\\nmoneytwo daughters at onceit cannot be a very agreeable operation\\nand it streightens him as to many things  however i do not mean to say\\nthey have not a right to it  it is very fit they should have\\ndaughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind\\nliberal father to me  mary does not above half like henriettas match\\nshe never did you know  but she does not do him justice\\nnor think enough about winthrop  i cannot make her attend to\\nthe value of the property  it is a very fair match as times go\\nand i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now\\n\\nsuch excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne\\nshould be happy in their childrens marriages  they do everything\\nto confer happiness i am sure  what a blessing to young people\\nto be in such hands  your father and mother seem so totally free\\nfrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct\\nand misery both in young and old  i hope you think louisa\\nperfectly recovered now\\n\\nhe answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered\\nbut she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing\\nor dancing it is quite different  if one happens only to shut the door\\na little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dabchick in the water\\nand benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her\\nall day long\\n\\nanne could not help laughing  that cannot be much to your taste\\ni know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man\\n\\nto be sure he is  nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think\\ni am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and\\npleasures as myself  i have a great value for benwick and when one can\\nbut get him to talk he has plenty to say  his reading has done him\\nno harm for he has fought as well as read  he is a brave fellow\\ni got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before\\nwe had a famous setto at rathunting all the morning in\\nmy fathers great barns and he played his part so well\\nthat i have liked him the better ever since\\n\\nhere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charless\\nfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had\\nheard enough to understand the present state of uppercross\\nand rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced\\nher sigh had none of the illwill of envy in it  she would certainly\\nhave risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want\\nto lessen theirs\\n\\nthe visit passed off altogether in high good humour  mary was\\nin excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change\\nand so well satisfied with the journey in her motherinlaws carriage\\nwith four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place\\nthat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought\\nand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house\\nas they were detailed to her  she had no demands on her father or sister\\nand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome\\ndrawingrooms\\n\\nelizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal\\nshe felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked\\nto dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style\\nthe reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those\\nwho had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch\\nit was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better\\nand then elizabeth was happy again  these were her internal persuasions\\nold fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess\\nto give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does\\ndid not even ask her own sisters family though they were here a month\\nand i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove\\nput her quite out of her way  i am sure she would rather not come\\nshe cannot feel easy with us  i will ask them all for an evening\\nthat will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat\\nthey have not seen two such drawing rooms before  they will be delighted\\nto come tomorrow evening  it shall be a regular party small\\nbut most elegant  and this satisfied elizabeth  and when the invitation\\nwas given to the two present and promised for the absent\\nmary was as completely satisfied  she was particularly asked\\nto meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret\\nwho were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not\\nhave received a more gratifying attention  miss elliot was to have\\nthe honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning\\nand anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her\\nand henrietta directly\\n\\nher plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present\\nthey all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes\\nbut anne convinced herself that a days delay of the intended communication\\ncould be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart\\nto see again the friends and companions of the last autumn\\nwith an eagerness of goodwill which many associations contributed to form\\n\\nthey found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves\\nand anne had the kindest welcome from each  henrietta was exactly\\nin that state of recentlyimproved views of freshformed happiness\\nwhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had\\never liked before at all and mrs musgroves real affection had been won\\nby her usefulness when they were in distress  it was a heartiness\\nand a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more\\nfrom the sad want of such blessings at home  she was entreated\\nto give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day\\nand all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return\\nshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance\\nand on charless leaving them together was listening to mrs musgroves\\nhistory of louisa and to henriettas of herself giving opinions\\non business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help\\nwhich mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts\\nfrom finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying\\nto convince her that she was not illused by anybody which mary\\nwell amused as she generally was in her station at a window\\noverlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have\\nher moments of imagining\\n\\na morning of thorough confusion was to be expected  a large party\\nin an hotel ensured a quickchanging unsettled scene  one five minutes\\nbrought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there\\nhalf an hour when their diningroom spacious as it was\\nseemed more than half filled  a party of steady old friends\\nwere seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with\\ncaptains harville and wentworth  the appearance of the latter\\ncould not be more than the surprise of the moment  it was impossible\\nfor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their\\ncommon friends must be soon bringing them together again\\ntheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings\\nshe had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared\\nfrom his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had\\nhastened him away from the concert room still governed\\nhe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation\\n\\nshe tried to be calm and leave things to take their course\\nand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence\\nsurely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts\\nmust understand each other ere long  we are not boy and girl\\nto be captiously irritable misled by every moments inadvertence\\nand wantonly playing with our own happiness  and yet\\na few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company\\nwith each other under their present circumstances could only be\\nexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most\\nmischievous kind\\n\\nanne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay\\ni am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her\\ni saw them turn the corner from bath street just now  they seemed\\ndeep in talk  who is it  come and tell me  good heavens i recollect\\nit is mr elliot himself\\n\\nno cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you\\nhe was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back\\ntill tomorrow\\n\\nas she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her\\nthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret\\nthat she had said so much simple as it was\\n\\nmary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin\\nbegan talking very warmly about the family features and protesting\\nstill more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne\\nto come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir\\nand tried to be cool and unconcerned  her distress returned\\nhowever on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between\\ntwo or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves\\nquite in the secret  it was evident that the report concerning her\\nhad spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure\\nthat it would now spread farther\\n\\ndo come anne cried mary come and look yourself  you will be too late\\nif you do not make haste  they are parting they are shaking hands\\nhe is turning away  not know mr elliot indeed  you seem to have\\nforgot all about lyme\\n\\nto pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment\\nanne did move quietly to the window  she was just in time to ascertain\\nthat it really was mr elliot which she had never believed\\nbefore he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off\\non the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel\\nat such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons\\nof totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot\\ncertainly  he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all\\nor i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair\\nrecomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well\\n\\nthe visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off\\nand then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with\\n\\nwell mother i have done something for you that you will like\\ni have been to the theatre and secured a box for tomorrow night\\nant i a good boy  i know you love a play and there is room for us all\\nit holds nine  i have engaged captain wentworth  anne will\\nnot be sorry to join us i am sure  we all like a play\\nhave not i done well mother\\n\\nmrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness\\nfor the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary\\neagerly interrupted her by exclaiming\\n\\ngood heavens charles how can you think of such a thing\\ntake a box for tomorrow night  have you forgot that we are engaged\\nto camden place tomorrow night and that we were most particularly asked\\nto meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all\\nthe principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them\\nhow can you be so forgetful\\n\\nphoo phoo replied charles whats an evening party\\nnever worth remembering  your father might have asked us to dinner\\ni think if he had wanted to see us  you may do as you like\\nbut i shall go to the play\\n\\noh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do\\nwhen you promised to go\\n\\nno i did not promise  i only smirked and bowed and said the word\\nhappy  there was no promise\\n\\nbut you must go charles  it would be unpardonable to fail\\nwe were asked on purpose to be introduced  there was always\\nsuch a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves\\nnothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately\\nwe are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too\\nwhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with  every attention\\nis due to mr elliot  consider my fathers heir  the future\\nrepresentative of the family\\n\\ndont talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles\\ni am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow\\nto the rising sun  if i would not go for the sake of your father\\ni should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir\\nwhat is mr elliot to me  the careless expression was life to anne\\nwho saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and\\nlistening with his whole soul and that the last words brought\\nhis enquiring eyes from charles to herself\\n\\ncharles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious\\nand half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she\\ninvariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting\\nto make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself\\nshe should not think herself very well used if they went to the play\\nwithout her  mrs musgrove interposed\\n\\nwe had better put it off  charles you had much better go back\\nand change the box for tuesday  it would be a pity to be divided\\nand we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her fathers\\nand i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play\\nif miss anne could not be with us\\n\\nanne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much\\nso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying\\n\\nif it depended only on my inclination maam the party at home\\nexcepting on marys account would not be the smallest impediment\\ni have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy\\nto change it for a play and with you  but it had better\\nnot be attempted perhaps  she had spoken it but she trembled\\nwhen it was done conscious that her words were listened to\\nand daring not even to try to observe their effect\\n\\nit was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day\\ncharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife\\nby persisting that he would go to the play tomorrow if nobody else would\\n\\ncaptain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fireplace\\nprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards\\nand taking a station with less barefaced design by anne\\n\\nyou have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy\\nthe evening parties of the place\\n\\noh no  the usual character of them has nothing for me\\ni am no cardplayer\\n\\nyou were not formerly i know  you did not use to like cards\\nbut time makes many changes\\n\\ni am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she\\nhardly knew what misconstruction  after waiting a few moments\\nhe said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling\\nit is a period indeed  eight years and a half is a period\\n\\nwhether he would have proceeded farther was left to annes imagination\\nto ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds\\nhe had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta\\neager to make use of the present leisure for getting out\\nand calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else\\nshould come in\\n\\nthey were obliged to move  anne talked of being perfectly ready\\nand tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known\\nthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair\\nin preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own\\nsensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection\\nwherewith to pity her\\n\\ntheir preparations however were stopped short  alarming sounds\\nwere heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open\\nfor sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give\\na general chill  anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked\\nsaw symptoms of the same  the comfort the freedom the gaiety\\nof the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence\\nor insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister\\nhow mortifying to feel that it was so\\n\\nher jealous eye was satisfied in one particular  captain wentworth\\nwas acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before\\nshe even addressed him once and looked at him more than once\\nelizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure  the sequel\\nexplained it  after the waste of a few minutes in saying\\nthe proper nothings she began to give the invitation which\\nwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves\\ntomorrow evening to meet a few friends  no formal party\\nit was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had\\nprovided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table\\nwith a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and\\none card more decidedly for captain wentworth  the truth was\\nthat elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand\\nthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his\\nthe past was nothing  the present was that captain wentworth\\nwould move about well in her drawingroom  the card was pointedly given\\nand sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared\\n\\nthe interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation\\nreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them out\\nbut not to anne  she could think only of the invitation she had\\nwith such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which\\nit had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather\\nthan gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance\\nshe knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe\\nthat he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement\\nfor all the insolence of the past  her spirits sank  he held the card\\nin his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it\\n\\nonly think of elizabeths including everybody whispered mary\\nvery audibly  i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted\\nyou see he cannot put the card out of his hand\\n\\nanne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself\\ninto a momentary expression of contempt and turned away\\nthat she might neither see nor hear more to vex her\\n\\nthe party separated  the gentlemen had their own pursuits\\nthe ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while\\nanne belonged to them  she was earnestly begged to return and dine\\nand give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been\\nso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more\\nand fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent\\nas she chose\\n\\npromising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore\\nshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place\\nthere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements\\nof elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrows party the frequent enumeration\\nof the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all\\nthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant\\nof its kind in bath while harassing herself with the neverending\\nquestion of whether captain wentworth would come or not  they were\\nreckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude\\nnever appeased for five minutes together  she generally thought\\nhe would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case\\nwhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion\\nas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings\\n\\nshe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation\\nto let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot\\nthree hours after his being supposed to be out of bath\\nfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview\\nfrom the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her\\nthere was guilt in mrs clays face as she listened  it was transient\\ncleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there\\nthe consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick\\nor some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend\\nperhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs\\non sir walter  she exclaimed however with a very tolerable\\nimitation of nature \\n\\noh dear very true  only think miss elliot to my great surprise\\ni met with mr elliot in bath street  i was never more astonished\\nhe turned back and walked with me to the pump yard  he had been prevented\\nsetting off for thornberry but i really forget by what\\nfor i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer\\nfor his being determined not to be delayed in his return\\nhe wanted to know how early he might be admitted tomorrow\\nhe was full of tomorrow and it is very evident that i have been\\nfull of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension\\nof your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have\\ngone so entirely out of my head\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 23\\n\\n\\none day only had passed since annes conversation with mrs smith\\nbut a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched\\nby mr elliots conduct except by its effects in one quarter\\nthat it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer\\nher explanatory visit in rivers street  she had promised to be\\nwith the musgroves from breakfast to dinner  her faith was plighted\\nand mr elliots character like the sultaness scheherazades head\\nmust live another day\\n\\nshe could not keep her appointment punctually however\\nthe weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain\\non her friends account and felt it very much on her own\\nbefore she was able to attempt the walk  when she reached the white hart\\nand made her way to the proper apartment she found herself\\nneither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive\\nthe party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft\\nand captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard\\nthat mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment\\nit had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest\\ninjunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there\\ntill they returned  she had only to submit sit down\\nbe outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once\\nin all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of\\ntasting a little before the morning closed  there was no delay\\nno waste of time  she was deep in the happiness of such misery\\nor the misery of such happiness instantly  two minutes after\\nher entering the room captain wentworth said\\n\\nwe will write the letter we were talking of harville now\\nif you will give me materials\\n\\nmaterials were at hand on a separate table he went to it\\nand nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing\\n\\nmrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest\\ndaughters engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice\\nwhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper\\nanne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet\\nas captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk\\nshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as\\nhow mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again\\nto talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day\\nand what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred\\nto my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what\\ni said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded\\nto think might do very well and a great deal in the same style\\nof openhearted communication  minutiae which even with every advantage\\nof taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give\\ncould be properly interesting only to the principals  mrs croft\\nwas attending with great goodhumour and whenever she spoke at all\\nit was very sensibly  anne hoped the gentlemen might each be\\ntoo much selfoccupied to hear\\n\\nand so maam all these thing considered said mrs musgrove\\nin her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different\\nyet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer\\nfor charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was\\npretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once\\nand make the best of it as many others have done before them\\nat any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement\\n\\nthat is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft\\ni would rather have young people settle on a small income at once\\nand have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be\\ninvolved in a long engagement  i always think that no mutual\\n\\noh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her\\nfinish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people\\nas a long engagement  it is what i always protested against\\nfor my children  it is all very well i used to say for young people\\nto be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry\\nin six months or even in twelve but a long engagement\\n\\nyes dear maam said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement\\nan engagement which may be long  to begin without knowing\\nthat at such a time there will be the means of marrying\\ni hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents\\nshould prevent as far as they can\\n\\nanne found an unexpected interest here  she felt its application\\nto herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same\\nmoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table\\ncaptain wentworths pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing\\nlistening and he turned round the next instant to give a look\\none quick conscious look at her\\n\\nthe two ladies continued to talk to reurge the same admitted truths\\nand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of\\na contrary practice as had fallen within their observation\\nbut anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear\\nher mind was in confusion\\n\\ncaptain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it\\nnow left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him\\nthough it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible\\nthat he was inviting her to join him where he stood  he looked at her\\nwith a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed\\ncome to me i have something to say and the unaffected\\neasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance\\nthan he really was strongly enforced the invitation  she roused herself\\nand went to him  the window at which he stood was at the other end\\nof the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer\\nto captain wentworths table not very near  as she joined him\\ncaptain harvilles countenance reassumed the serious thoughtful\\nexpression which seemed its natural character\\n\\nlook here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying\\na small miniature painting do you know who that is\\n\\ncertainly  captain benwick\\n\\nyes and you may guess who it is for  but in a deep tone\\nit was not done for her  miss elliot do you remember our\\nwalking together at lyme and grieving for him  i little thought then\\nbut no matter  this was drawn at the cape  he met with\\na clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise\\nto my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her\\nand i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another\\nit was a commission to me  but who else was there to employ\\ni hope i can allow for him  i am not sorry indeed to make it\\nover to another  he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth\\nhe is writing about it now  and with a quivering lip he wound up\\nthe whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon\\n\\nno replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe\\n\\nit was not in her nature  she doted on him\\n\\nit would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved\\n\\ncaptain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that\\nfor your sex and she answered the question smiling also\\nyes  we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us\\nit is perhaps our fate rather than our merit  we cannot help ourselves\\nwe live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us\\nyou are forced on exertion  you have always a profession pursuits\\nbusiness of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately\\nand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions\\n\\ngranting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men\\nwhich however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply\\nto benwick  he has not been forced upon any exertion  the peace\\nturned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us\\nin our little family circle ever since\\n\\ntrue said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall\\nwe say now captain harville  if the change be not from\\noutward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature\\nmans nature which has done the business for captain benwick\\n\\nno no it is not mans nature  i will not allow it to be more\\nmans nature than womans to be inconstant and forget those they do love\\nor have loved  i believe the reverse  i believe in a true analogy\\nbetween our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are\\nthe strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage\\nand riding out the heaviest weather\\n\\nyour feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit\\nof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender\\nman is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived\\nwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments\\nnay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise\\nyou have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with\\nyou are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship\\nyour home country friends all quitted  neither time nor health\\nnor life to be called your own  it would be hard indeed\\nwith a faltering voice if womans feelings were to be\\nadded to all this\\n\\nwe shall never agree upon this question captain harville\\nwas beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention\\nto captain wentworths hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room\\nit was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was\\nstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined\\nto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been\\noccupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think\\nhe could have caught\\n\\nhave you finished your letter said captain harville\\n\\nnot quite a few lines more  i shall have done in five minutes\\n\\nthere is no hurry on my side  i am only ready whenever you are\\ni am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied\\nand want for nothing  no hurry for a signal at all  well miss elliot\\nlowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree\\ni suppose upon this point  no man and woman would probably\\nbut let me observe that all histories are against youall stories\\nprose and verse  if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you\\nfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think\\ni ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say\\nupon womans inconstancy  songs and proverbs all talk\\nof womans fickleness  but perhaps you will say these were all\\nwritten by men\\n\\nperhaps i shall  yes yes if you please no reference to examples\\nin books  men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story\\neducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has\\nbeen in their hands  i will not allow books to prove anything\\n\\nbut how shall we prove anything\\n\\nwe never shall  we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point\\nit is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof\\nwe each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex\\nand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it\\nwhich has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances\\nperhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such\\nas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence\\nor in some respect saying what should not be said\\n\\nah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling\\nif i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes\\na last look at his wife and children and watches the boat\\nthat he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight\\nand then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again\\nand then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does\\nsee them again when coming back after a twelvemonths absence\\nperhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon\\nit be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself\\nand saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while\\nhoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last\\nas if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still\\nif i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do\\nand glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence\\ni speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own\\nwith emotion\\n\\noh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you\\nand by those who resemble you  god forbid that i should undervalue\\nthe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellowcreatures\\ni should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment\\nand constancy were known only by woman  no i believe you capable\\nof everything great and good in your married lives  i believe you equal\\nto every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance\\nso long asif i may be allowed the expressionso long as you have\\nan object  i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you\\nall the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one\\nyou need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence\\nor when hope is gone\\n\\nshe could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart\\nwas too full her breath too much oppressed\\n\\nyou are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand\\non her arm quite affectionately  there is no quarrelling with you\\nand when i think of benwick my tongue is tied\\n\\ntheir attention was called towards the others  mrs croft was taking leave\\n\\nhere frederick you and i part company i believe said she\\ni am going home and you have an engagement with your friend\\ntonight we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party\\nturning to anne  we had your sisters card yesterday\\nand i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it\\nand you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves\\n\\ncaptain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either\\ncould not or would not answer fully\\n\\nyes said he very true here we separate but harville and i\\nshall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready\\ni am in half a minute  i know you will not be sorry to be off\\ni shall be at your service in half a minute\\n\\nmrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter\\nwith great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried\\nagitated air which shewed impatience to be gone  anne knew not how\\nto understand it  she had the kindest good morning god bless you\\nfrom captain harville but from him not a word nor a look\\nhe had passed out of the room without a look\\n\\nshe had only time however to move closer to the table where\\nhe had been writing when footsteps were heard returning\\nthe door opened it was himself  he begged their pardon\\nbut he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room\\nto the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper\\nplaced it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her\\nfor a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room\\nalmost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it\\nthe work of an instant\\n\\nthe revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost\\nbeyond expression  the letter with a direction hardly legible\\nto miss a e was evidently the one which he had been folding\\nso hastily  while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick\\nhe had been also addressing her  on the contents of that letter\\ndepended all which this world could do for her  anything was possible\\nanything might be defied rather than suspense  mrs musgrove had\\nlittle arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection\\nshe must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied\\nsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written\\nher eyes devoured the following words\\n\\n\\ni can listen no longer in silence  i must speak to you by such means\\nas are within my reach  you pierce my soul  i am half agony\\nhalf hope  tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings\\nare gone for ever  i offer myself to you again with a heart\\neven more your own than when you almost broke it eight years\\nand a half ago  dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman\\nthat his love has an earlier death  i have loved none but you\\nunjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been\\nbut never inconstant  you alone have brought me to bath\\nfor you alone i think and plan  have you not seen this\\ncan you fail to have understood my wishes  i had not waited even\\nthese ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have\\npenetrated mine  i can hardly write  i am every instant hearing\\nsomething which overpowers me  you sink your voice but i can\\ndistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others\\ntoo good too excellent creature  you do us justice indeed\\nyou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men\\nbelieve it to be most fervent most undeviating in f w\\n\\ni must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither\\nor follow your party as soon as possible  a word a look\\nwill be enough to decide whether i enter your fathers house\\nthis evening or never\\n\\n\\nsuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from  half and hours solitude\\nand reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only\\nwhich now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints\\nof her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity  every moment\\nrather brought fresh agitation  it was overpowering happiness\\nand before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation\\ncharles mary and henrietta all came in\\n\\nthe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then\\nan immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more\\nshe began not to understand a word they said and was obliged\\nto plead indisposition and excuse herself  they could then see\\nthat she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not\\nstir without her for the world  this was dreadful  would they only\\nhave gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room\\nit would have been her cure but to have them all standing or\\nwaiting around her was distracting and in desperation\\nshe said she would go home\\n\\nby all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly\\nand take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening\\ni wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself\\ncharles ring and order a chair  she must not walk\\n\\nbut the chair would never do  worse than all  to lose the possibility\\nof speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet\\nsolitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him\\ncould not be borne  the chair was earnestly protested against\\nand mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness\\nhaving assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall\\nin the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down\\nand got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having\\nhad no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on\\nfinding her better at night\\n\\nanxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said\\n\\ni am afraid maam that it is not perfectly understood\\npray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope\\nto see your whole party this evening  i am afraid there had been\\nsome mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville\\nand captain wentworth that we hope to see them both\\n\\noh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word\\ncaptain harville has no thought but of going\\n\\ndo you think so  but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry\\nwill you promise me to mention it when you see them again\\nyou will see them both this morning i dare say  do promise me\\n\\nto be sure i will if you wish it  charles if you see captain harville\\nanywhere remember to give miss annes message  but indeed my dear\\nyou need not be uneasy  captain harville holds himself quite engaged\\nill answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say\\n\\nanne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance\\nto damp the perfection of her felicity  it could not be very lasting\\nhowever  even if he did not come to camden place himself\\nit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence\\nby captain harville  another momentary vexation occurred\\ncharles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her\\nthere was no preventing him  this was almost cruel  but she could not\\nbe long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmiths\\nto be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling\\nbut gratitude apparent\\n\\nthey were on union street when a quicker step behind a something\\nof familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight\\nof captain wentworth  he joined them but as if irresolute\\nwhether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked\\nanne could command herself enough to receive that look\\nand not repulsively  the cheeks which had been pale now glowed\\nand the movements which had hesitated were decided  he walked by her side\\npresently struck by a sudden thought charles said\\n\\ncaptain wentworth which way are you going  only to gay street\\nor farther up the town\\n\\ni hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised\\n\\nare you going as high as belmont  are you going near camden place\\nbecause if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you\\nto take my place and give anne your arm to her fathers door\\nshe is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help\\nand i ought to be at that fellows in the market place\\nhe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off\\nsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment\\nthat i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance\\nby his description a good deal like the second size doublebarrel of mine\\nwhich you shot with one day round winthrop\\n\\nthere could not be an objection  there could be only the most\\nproper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view\\nand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture\\nin half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again\\nand the other two proceeding together  and soon words enough had passed\\nbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet\\nand retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make\\nthe present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all\\nthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives\\ncould bestow  there they exchanged again those feelings\\nand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything\\nbut which had been followed by so many many years of division\\nand estrangement  there they returned again into the past\\nmore exquisitely happy perhaps in their reunion than when\\nit had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed\\nin a knowledge of each others character truth and attachment\\nmore equal to act more justified in acting  and there as they slowly\\npaced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them\\nseeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers\\nflirting girls nor nurserymaids and children they could indulge in\\nthose retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in\\nthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment\\nwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest  all the little\\nvariations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday\\nand today there could scarcely be an end\\n\\nshe had not mistaken him  jealousy of mr elliot had been\\nthe retarding weight the doubt the torment  that had begun to operate\\nin the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned\\nafter a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him\\nin everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do\\nin the last fourandtwenty hours  it had been gradually yielding\\nto the better hopes which her looks or words or actions\\noccasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by\\nthose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked\\nwith captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which\\nhe had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings\\n\\nof what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified\\nhe persisted in having loved none but her  she had never been supplanted\\nhe never even believed himself to see her equal  thus much indeed\\nhe was obliged to acknowledge  that he had been constant unconsciously\\nnay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it\\nto be done  he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only\\nbeen angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been\\na sufferer from them  her character was now fixed on his mind\\nas perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude\\nand gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross\\nhad he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun\\nto understand himself  at lyme he had received lessons\\nof more than one sort  the passing admiration of mr elliot\\nhad at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at\\ncaptain harvilles had fixed her superiority\\n\\nin his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove\\nthe attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever\\nfelt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care\\nfor louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection\\nwhich followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence\\nof the mind with which louisas could so ill bear a comparison\\nor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own\\nthere he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle\\nand the obstinacy of selfwill between the darings of heedlessness\\nand the resolution of a collected mind  there he had seen everything\\nto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun\\nto deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment\\nwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way\\n\\nfrom that period his penance had become severe  he had no sooner\\nbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days\\nof louisas accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again\\nthan he

marry they are pretty sure by perseverance\\nto carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent\\nor ever so little likely to be necessary to each others ultimate comfort\\nthis may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth\\nand if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and\\nan anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind\\nconsciousness of right

for her  on the contrary\\nwhen he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight\\nand eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims\\nand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced\\nagainst her superiority of rank and all this assisted by\\nhis wellsounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen\\nwith a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage\\nin the volume of honour\\n\\nthe only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite\\nany serious anxiety was lady russell  anne knew that lady russell\\nmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot\\nand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with\\nand do justice to captain wentworth  this however was what\\nlady russell had now to do  she must learn to feel that she had\\nbeen mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced\\nby appearances in each that because captain wentworths manners\\nhad not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them\\nto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because\\nmr elliots manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety\\nand correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been\\ntoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct\\nopinions and wellregulated mind  there was nothing less\\nfor lady russell to do than to admit that she had been\\npretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions\\nand of hopes\\n\\nthere is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment\\nof character a natural penetration in short which no experience\\nin others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted\\nin this part of understanding than her young friend  but she was\\na very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible\\nand welljudging her first was to see anne happy  she loved anne\\nbetter than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness\\nof the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself\\nas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child\\n\\nof all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified\\nby the circumstance  it was creditable to have a sister married\\nand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental\\nto the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn\\nand as her own sister must be better than her husbands sisters\\nit was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than\\neither captain benwick or charles hayter  she had something to suffer\\nperhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored\\nto the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette\\nbut she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation\\nanne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate\\nno headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth\\nfrom being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne\\n\\nit would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied\\nwith her situation for a change is not very

him\\n\\nthe news of his cousins annes engagement burst on mr elliot\\nmost unexpectedly  it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness\\nhis best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness\\nwhich a soninlaws rights would have given  but though discomfited\\nand disappointed he could still do something for his own interest\\nand his own enjoyment  he soon quitted bath and on mrs clays\\nquitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established\\nunder his protection in london it was evident how double a game\\nhe had been playing and how determined he was to save himself\\nfrom being cut out by one artful woman at least\\n\\nmrs clays affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed\\nfor the young mans sake the possibility of scheming longer\\nfor sir walter  she has abilities however as well as affections\\nand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers\\nmay finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being\\nthe wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last\\ninto making her the wife of sir william\\n\\nit cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked\\nand mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of\\ntheir deception in her  they had their great cousins to be sure\\nto resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter\\nand

happened soon afterwards\\nhe added to his wealth  to him therefore the succession\\nto the norland estate was not so really important as to\\nhis sisters for their fortune independent of what might\\narise to them from their fathers inheriting that property\\ncould be but small  their mother had nothing and their\\nfather only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal\\nfor the remaining

dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his\\nwife and daughters than for himself or his sonbut to\\nhis son and his sons son a child of four years old\\nit was secured in such a way as to leave to himself\\nno power of providing for those who were most dear\\nto him and who most needed a provision by any charge\\non the estate or by any sale of its valuable woods\\nthe whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who\\nin occasional visits with his father and mother at norland\\nhad so far gained on the affections of his uncle\\nby such attractions as are by no means unusual in children\\nof two or three years old an imperfect articulation\\nan earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks\\nand a great deal of noise as to outweigh all the value\\nof all the attention which for years he had received\\nfrom his niece and her daughters  he meant not to\\nbe unkind however and as a mark of his affection\\nfor the three girls he left them a thousand pounds

of his own mothers fortune\\nwarmed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity\\nyes he would give them three thousand pounds it would\\nbe liberal and handsome it would be enough to make\\nthem completely easy  three thousand pounds he could\\nspare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience\\nhe thought of it all day long and for many days successively\\nand he did not repent\\n\\nno sooner was his fathers funeral over than mrs john\\ndashwood without sending any notice of her intention to her\\nmotherinlaw arrived with her child and their attendants\\nno one could dispute her right to come the house was\\nher husbands from the moment of his fathers decease\\nbut the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater\\nand to a woman in mrs dashwoods situation with only\\ncommon feelings must have been highly unpleasing\\nbut in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen\\na generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind\\nby whomsoever given or received was to her a source\\nof immoveable disgust  mrs john dashwood had never\\nbeen a favourite with any of her husbands family\\nbut she had had no opportunity till the present\\nof shewing them with how little attention to the comfort\\nof other people she could act when occasion required it\\n\\nso acutely did mrs dashwood feel this ungracious\\nbehaviour and so earnestly did she despise

was\\nso effectual possessed a strength of understanding\\nand coolness of judgment which qualified her\\nthough only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother\\nand enabled her frequently to

quiet civility and by her husband\\nwith as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody\\nbeyond himself his wife and their child  he really\\npressed them with some earnestness to consider

pleasure she was\\nbeyond alloy\\n\\nmrs john dashwood did not at all approve of what her\\nhusband intended to do for his sisters  to take three\\nthousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy\\nwould be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree\\nshe begged him to think again on the subject  how could\\nhe answer it to himself to rob his child and his only\\nchild too of so large a sum  and what possible claim\\ncould the miss dashwoods who were related to him only by\\nhalf blood which she considered as no relationship at all\\nhave on his generosity to so large an amount  it was very\\nwell known that no affection was ever supposed to exist\\nbetween the children of any man by different marriages\\nand why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry\\nby giving away all his money to his half sisters\\n\\nit was my fathers last request to me replied\\nher husband that i should assist his widow and daughters\\n\\nhe did not know what he was talking of i dare say\\nten to one but he was lightheaded at the time\\nhad he been in his right senses he could not have thought\\nof such a thing as begging you to give away half your\\nfortune from your own child\\n\\nhe did not stipulate for any particular sum\\nmy dear fanny he only requested me in general terms\\nto assist them and make their situation more comfortable\\nthan it was in his power to do  perhaps it would\\nhave been as well if he had left it wholly to myself\\nhe could hardly suppose i should neglect them\\nbut as he required the promise i could not do less\\nthan give it at least i thought so at the time\\nthe promise therefore was given and must be performed\\nsomething must be done for them whenever they leave norland\\nand settle in a new home\\n\\nwell then let something be done for them\\nbut that something need not be three thousand pounds\\nconsider she added that when the money is once\\nparted with it never can return  your sisters will marry\\nand it will be gone for ever  if indeed it could\\nbe restored to our poor little boy\\n\\nwhy to be sure said her husband very gravely\\nthat would make great difference  the time may come when\\nharry will regret that so large a sum was parted with\\nif he should have a numerous family for instance it would\\nbe a very convenient addition\\n\\nto be sure it would\\n\\nperhaps then it would be better for all parties\\nif the sum were diminished one halffive hundred pounds\\nwould be a prodigious increase to their fortunes\\n\\noh beyond anything great  what brother on earth\\nwould do half so much for his sisters even if really\\nhis sisters  and as it isonly half bloodbut you\\nhave such a generous spirit\\n\\ni would not wish to do any thing mean he replied\\none had rather on such occasions do too much than\\ntoo little  no one at least can think i have not\\ndone enough for them even themselves they can hardly\\nexpect more\\n\\nthere is no knowing what they may expect\\nsaid the lady but we are not to think of their\\nexpectations the question is what you can afford to do\\n\\ncertainlyand i think i may afford to give them five\\nhundred pounds apiece  as it is without any addition\\nof mine they will each have about three thousand pounds\\non their mothers deatha very comfortable fortune\\nfor any young woman\\n\\nto be sure it is and indeed it strikes me that\\nthey can want no addition at all  they will have ten\\nthousand pounds divided amongst them  if they marry\\nthey will be sure of doing well and if they do not\\nthey may all live very comfortably together on the interest\\nof ten thousand pounds\\n\\nthat is very true and therefore i do not know whether\\nupon the whole it would not be more advisable to do\\nsomething for their mother while she lives rather than\\nfor themsomething of the annuity kind i meanmy sisters\\nwould feel the good effects of it as well as herself\\na hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable\\n\\nhis wife hesitated a little however in giving\\nher consent to this plan\\n\\nto be sure said she it is better than parting with\\nfifteen hundred pounds at once  but then if mrs dashwood\\nshould live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in\\n\\nfifteen years my dear fanny her life cannot\\nbe worth half that purchase\\n\\ncertainly not but if you observe people always\\nlive for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them\\nand she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty\\nan annuity is a very serious business it comes over\\nand over every year and there is no getting rid\\nof it  you are not aware of what you are doing\\ni have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities\\nfor my mother was clogged with the payment of three\\nto old superannuated servants by my fathers will\\nand it is amazing how disagreeable she found it\\ntwice every year these annuities were to be paid and then\\nthere was the trouble of getting it to them and then one\\nof them was said to have died and afterwards it turned\\nout to be no such thing  my mother was quite sick of it\\nher income was not her own she said with such perpetual\\nclaims on it and it was the more unkind in my father\\nbecause otherwise the money would have been entirely at\\nmy mothers disposal without any restriction whatever\\nit has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am\\nsure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for\\nall the world\\n\\nit is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr dashwood\\nto have those kind of yearly drains on ones income\\nones fortune as your mother justly says is not ones own\\nto be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum\\non every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away\\nones independence\\n\\nundoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it\\nthey think themselves secure you do no more than what\\nis expected and it raises no gratitude at all  if i were you\\nwhatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely\\ni would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly\\nit may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred\\nor even fifty pounds from our own expenses\\n\\ni believe you are right my love it will be better\\nthat there should by no annuity in the case whatever i\\nmay give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance\\nthan a yearly allowance because they would only enlarge\\ntheir style of living if they felt sure of a larger income\\nand would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end\\nof the year  it will certainly be much the best way\\na present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent\\ntheir ever being distressed for money and will i think\\nbe amply discharging my promise to my father\\n\\nto be sure it will  indeed to say the truth\\ni am convinced within myself that your father had no idea\\nof your giving them any money at all  the assistance\\nhe thought of i dare say was only such as might be\\nreasonably expected of you for instance such as looking\\nout for a comfortable small house for them helping them\\nto move their things and sending them presents of fish\\nand game and so forth whenever they are in season\\nill lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed\\nit would be very strange and unreasonable if he did\\ndo but consider my dear mr dashwood how excessively\\ncomfortable your motherinlaw and her daughters may live\\non the interest of seven thousand pounds besides the\\nthousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings\\nthem in fifty pounds a year apiece and of course\\nthey will pay their mother for their board out of it\\naltogether they will have five hundred ayear amongst them\\nand what on earth can four women want for more than\\nthatthey will live so cheap their housekeeping will\\nbe nothing at all  they will have no carriage no horses\\nand hardly any servants they will keep no company\\nand can have no expenses of any kind  only conceive\\nhow comfortable they will be  five hundred a year i am\\nsure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it\\nand as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to think\\nof it  they will be much more able to give you something\\n\\nupon my word said mr dashwood i believe you\\nare perfectly right  my father certainly could mean\\nnothing more by his request to me than what you say\\ni clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil\\nmy engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness\\nto them as you have described  when my mother removes\\ninto another house my services shall be readily given\\nto accommodate her as far as i can  some little present\\nof furniture too may be acceptable then\\n\\ncertainly returned mrs john dashwood  but however\\none thing must be considered  when your father and mother\\nmoved to norland though the furniture of stanhill\\nwas sold all the china plate and linen was saved\\nand is now left to your mother  her house will therefore\\nbe almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it\\n\\nthat is a material consideration undoubtedly\\na valuable legacy indeed and yet some of the plate would\\nhave been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here\\n\\nyes and the set of breakfast china is twice\\nas handsome as what belongs to this house  a great\\ndeal too handsome in my opinion for any place they\\ncan ever afford to live in  but however so it is\\nyour father thought only of them  and i must say this\\nthat you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention\\nto his wishes for we very well know that if he could\\nhe would have left almost everything in the world to them\\n\\nthis argument was irresistible  it gave to his\\nintentions whatever of decision was wanting before and he\\nfinally resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary\\nif not highly indecorous to do more for the widow\\nand children of his father than such kind of neighbourly\\nacts as his own wife pointed out\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 3\\n\\n\\nmrs dashwood remained at norland several months\\nnot from any disinclination to move when the sight of every\\nwell known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it\\nproduced for a while for when her spirits began to revive\\nand her mind became capable of some other exertion than that\\nof heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances\\nshe was impatient to be gone and indefatigable in her inquiries\\nfor a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of norland\\nfor to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible\\nbut she could hear of no situation that at once answered\\nher notions of comfort and ease and suited the prudence\\nof her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected\\nseveral houses as too large for their income which her\\nmother would have approved\\n\\nmrs dashwood had been informed by her husband of the\\nsolemn promise on the part of his son in their favour\\nwhich gave comfort to his last earthly reflections\\nshe doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he\\nhad doubted it himself and she thought of it for her daughters\\nsake with satisfaction though as for herself she was\\npersuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000l would\\nsupport her in affluence  for their brothers sake too\\nfor the sake of his own heart she rejoiced and she\\nreproached herself for being unjust to his merit before\\nin believing him incapable of generosity  his attentive\\nbehaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that\\ntheir welfare was dear to him and for a long time\\nshe firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions\\n\\nthe contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance\\nfelt for her daughterinlaw was very much increased\\nby the farther knowledge of her character which half\\na years residence in her family afforded and perhaps\\nin spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal\\naffection on the side of the former the two ladies might\\nhave found it impossible to have lived together so long\\nhad not a particular circumstance occurred to give\\nstill greater eligibility according to the opinions\\nof mrs dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland\\n\\nthis circumstance was a growing attachment between\\nher eldest girl and the brother of mrs john dashwood\\na gentlemanlike and pleasing young man who was introduced\\nto their acquaintance soon after his sisters establishment\\nat norland and who had since spent the greatest part\\nof his time there\\n\\nsome mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from\\nmotives of interest for edward ferrars was the eldest son\\nof a man who had died very rich and some might have repressed\\nit from motives of prudence for except a trifling sum\\nthe whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother\\nbut mrs dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration\\nit was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable\\nthat he loved her daughter and that elinor returned\\nthe partiality  it was contrary to every doctrine of\\nhers that difference of fortune should keep any couple\\nasunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition\\nand that elinors merit should not be acknowledged\\nby every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible\\n\\nedward ferrars was not recommended to their good\\nopinion by any peculiar graces of person or address\\nhe was not handsome and his manners required intimacy\\nto make them pleasing  he was too diffident to do justice\\nto himself but when his natural shyness was overcome\\nhis behaviour gave every indication of an open\\naffectionate heart  his understanding was good\\nand his education had given it solid improvement\\nbut he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition\\nto answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed\\nto see him distinguishedasthey hardly knew what\\nthey wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some\\nmanner or other  his mother wished to interest him in\\npolitical concerns to get him into parliament or to see\\nhim connected with some of the great men of the day\\nmrs john dashwood wished it likewise but in the mean while\\ntill one of these superior blessings could be attained it would\\nhave quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche\\nbut edward had no turn for great men or barouches\\nall his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet\\nof private life  fortunately he had a younger brother\\nwho was more promising\\n\\nedward had been staying several weeks in the house\\nbefore he engaged much of mrs dashwoods attention\\nfor she was at that time in such affliction as rendered\\nher careless of surrounding objects  she saw only that he\\nwas quiet and unobtrusive and she liked him for it\\nhe did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by\\nilltimed conversation  she was first called to observe\\nand approve him farther by a reflection which elinor\\nchanced one day to make on the difference between him\\nand his sister  it was a contrast which recommended him\\nmost forcibly to her mother\\n\\nit is enough said she to say that he is unlike\\nfanny is enough  it implies everything amiable\\ni love him already\\n\\ni think you will like him said elinor when you\\nknow more of him\\n\\nlike him replied her mother with a smile\\ni feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love\\n\\nyou may esteem him\\n\\ni have never yet known what it was to separate\\nesteem and love\\n\\nmrs dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him\\nher manners were attaching and soon banished his reserve\\nshe speedily comprehended all his merits the persuasion\\nof his regard for elinor perhaps assisted her penetration\\nbut she really felt assured of his worth and even that\\nquietness of manner which militated against all her\\nestablished ideas of what a young mans address ought to be\\nwas no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be\\nwarm and his temper affectionate\\n\\nno sooner did she perceive any symptom of love\\nin his behaviour to elinor than she considered their\\nserious attachment as certain and looked forward\\nto their marriage as rapidly approaching\\n\\nin a few months my dear marianne said she\\nelinor will in all probability be settled for life\\nwe shall miss her but she will be happy\\n\\noh mamma how shall we do without her\\n\\nmy love it will be scarcely a separation\\nwe shall live within a few miles of each other and shall\\nmeet every day of our lives  you will gain a brother\\na real affectionate brother  i have the highest opinion\\nin the world of edwards heart  but you look grave\\nmarianne do you disapprove your sisters choice\\n\\nperhaps said marianne i may consider it\\nwith some surprise  edward is very amiable and i love\\nhim tenderly  but yethe is not the kind of young\\nmanthere is something wantinghis figure is not striking\\nit has none of that grace which i should expect\\nin the man who could seriously attach my sister\\nhis eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once\\nannounce virtue and intelligence  and besides all this\\ni am afraid mamma he has no real taste  music seems\\nscarcely to attract him and though he admires elinors\\ndrawings very much it is not the admiration of a person\\nwho can understand their worth  it is evident in spite of\\nhis frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact\\nhe knows nothing of the matter  he admires as a lover\\nnot as a connoisseur  to satisfy me those characters\\nmust be united  i could not be happy with a man whose\\ntaste did not in every point coincide with my own\\nhe must enter into all my feelings the same books\\nthe same music must charm us both  oh mama how spiritless\\nhow tame was edwards manner in reading to us last night\\ni felt for my sister most severely  yet she bore it\\nwith so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it\\ni could hardly keep my seat  to hear those beautiful lines\\nwhich have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced\\nwith such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference\\n\\nhe would certainly have done more justice to\\nsimple and elegant prose  i thought so at the time\\nbut you would give him cowper\\n\\nnay mamma if he is not to be animated by cowper\\nbut we must allow for difference of taste  elinor has\\nnot my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and\\nbe happy with him  but it would have broke my heart\\nhad i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility\\nmama the more i know of the world the more am i convinced\\nthat i shall never see a man whom i can really love\\ni require so much  he must have all edwards virtues\\nand his person and manners must ornament his goodness\\nwith every possible charm\\n\\nremember my love that you are not seventeen\\nit is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness\\nwhy should you be less fortunate than your mother  in\\none circumstance only my marianne may your destiny be\\ndifferent from hers\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 4\\n\\n\\nwhat a pity it is elinor said marianne\\nthat edward should have no taste for drawing\\n\\nno taste for drawing replied elinor why should\\nyou think so he does not draw himself indeed but he has\\ngreat pleasure in seeing the performances of other people\\nand i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste\\nthough he has not had opportunities of improving it\\nhad he ever been in the way of learning i think he would\\nhave drawn very well  he distrusts his own judgment\\nin such matters so much that he is always unwilling\\nto give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate\\npropriety and simplicity of taste which in general\\ndirect him perfectly right\\n\\nmarianne was afraid of offending and said no more\\non the subject but the kind of approbation which elinor\\ndescribed as excited in him by the drawings of other\\npeople was very far from that rapturous delight which\\nin her opinion could alone be called taste  yet though\\nsmiling within herself at the mistake she honoured\\nher sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it\\n\\ni hope marianne continued elinor you do not\\nconsider him as deficient in general taste  indeed i think\\ni may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him\\nis perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion\\ni am sure you could never be civil to him\\n\\nmarianne hardly knew what to say  she would\\nnot wound the feelings of her sister on any account\\nand yet to say what she did not believe was impossible\\nat length she replied\\n\\ndo not be offended elinor if my praise of him\\nis not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits\\ni have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter\\npropensities of his mind his inclinations and tastes\\nas you have but i have the highest opinion in the world\\nof his goodness and sense  i think him every thing that is\\nworthy and amiable\\n\\ni am sure replied elinor with a smile\\nthat his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied\\nwith such commendation as that  i do not perceive\\nhow you could express yourself more warmly\\n\\nmarianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased\\n\\nof his sense and his goodness continued elinor\\nno one can i think be in doubt who has seen him\\noften enough to engage him in unreserved conversation\\nthe excellence of his understanding and his principles\\ncan be concealed only by that shyness which too often\\nkeeps him silent  you know enough of him to do justice\\nto his solid worth  but of his minuter propensities\\nas you call them you have from peculiar circumstances\\nbeen kept more ignorant than myself  he and i have\\nbeen at times thrown a good deal together while you\\nhave been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate\\nprinciple by my mother  i have seen a great deal of him\\nhave studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on\\nsubjects of literature and taste and upon the whole\\ni venture to pronounce that his mind is wellinformed\\nenjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively\\nhis observation just and correct and his taste delicate\\nand pure  his abilities in every respect improve\\nas much upon acquaintance as his manners and person\\nat first sight his address is certainly not striking\\nand his person can hardly be called handsome till the\\nexpression of his eyes which are uncommonly good\\nand the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived\\nat present i know him so well that i think him\\nreally handsome or at least almost so  what say you\\nmarianne\\n\\ni shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i\\ndo not now  when you tell me to love him as a brother\\ni shall no more see imperfection in his face than i now do\\nin his heart\\n\\nelinor started at this declaration and was sorry for\\nthe warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him\\nshe felt that edward stood very high in her opinion\\nshe believed the regard to be mutual but she required\\ngreater certainty of it to make mariannes conviction\\nof their attachment agreeable to her  she knew that\\nwhat marianne and her mother conjectured one moment\\nthey believed the nextthat with them to wish was to hope\\nand to hope was to expect  she tried to explain the real\\nstate of the case to her sister\\n\\ni do not attempt to deny said she that i think\\nvery highly of himthat i greatly esteem that i like him\\n\\nmarianne here burst forth with indignation\\n\\nesteem him like him coldhearted elinor oh\\nworse than coldhearted ashamed of being otherwise\\nuse those words again and i will leave the room this moment\\n\\nelinor could not help laughing  excuse me\\nsaid she and be assured that i meant no offence to you\\nby speaking in so quiet a way of my own feelings\\nbelieve them to be stronger than i have declared\\nbelieve them in short to be such as his merit and the\\nsuspicionthe hope of his affection for me may warrant\\nwithout imprudence or folly  but farther than this you must\\nnot believe  i am by no means assured of his regard for me\\nthere are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful\\nand till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder\\nat my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality\\nby believing or calling it more than it is  in my heart\\ni feel littlescarcely any doubt of his preference\\nbut there are other points to be considered besides\\nhis inclination  he is very far from being independent\\nwhat his mother really is we cannot know but from fannys\\noccasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have\\nnever been disposed to think her amiable and i am very\\nmuch mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there\\nwould be many difficulties in his way if he were to wish\\nto marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or\\nhigh rank\\n\\nmarianne was astonished to find how much the imagination\\nof her mother and herself had outstripped the truth\\n\\nand you really are not engaged to him said she\\nyet it certainly soon will happen  but two advantages\\nwill proceed from this delay  i shall not lose you so soon\\nand edward will have greater opportunity of improving\\nthat natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must\\nbe so indispensably necessary to your future felicity\\noh if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to\\nlearn to draw himself how delightful it would be\\n\\nelinor had given her real opinion to her sister\\nshe could not consider her partiality for edward\\nin so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it\\nthere was at times a want of spirits about him which\\nif it did not denote indifference spoke of something almost\\nas unpromising  a doubt of her regard supposing him\\nto feel it need not give him more than inquietude\\nit would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind\\nwhich frequently attended him  a more reasonable cause\\nmight be found in the dependent situation which forbade\\nthe indulgence of his affection  she knew that his mother\\nneither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable\\nat present nor to give him any assurance that he might form\\na home for himself without strictly attending to her views\\nfor his aggrandizement  with such a knowledge as this\\nit was impossible for elinor to feel easy on the subject\\nshe was far from depending on that result of his preference\\nof her which her mother and sister still considered\\nas certain  nay the longer they were together the more\\ndoubtful seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes\\nfor a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more\\nthan friendship\\n\\nbut whatever might really be its limits it was enough\\nwhen perceived by his sister to make her uneasy\\nand at the same time which was still more common\\nto make her uncivil  she took the first opportunity of\\naffronting her motherinlaw on the occasion talking to\\nher so expressively of her brothers great expectations\\nof mrs ferrarss resolution that both her sons should\\nmarry well and of the danger attending any young woman\\nwho attempted to draw him in that mrs dashwood could\\nneither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to be calm\\nshe gave her an answer which marked her contempt\\nand instantly left the room resolving that whatever might\\nbe the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal\\nher beloved elinor should not be exposed another week\\nto such insinuations\\n\\nin this state of her spirits a letter was delivered\\nto her from the post which contained a proposal\\nparticularly well timed  it was the offer of a small house\\non very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own\\na gentleman of consequence and property in devonshire\\nthe letter was from this gentleman himself and written\\nin the true spirit of friendly accommodation\\nhe understood that she was in need of a dwelling\\nand though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage\\nhe assured her that everything should be done to it which\\nshe might think necessary if the situation pleased her\\nhe earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars\\nof the house and garden to come with her daughters to\\nbarton park the place of his own residence from whence\\nshe might judge herself whether barton cottage for the\\nhouses were in the same parish could by any alteration\\nbe made comfortable to her  he seemed really anxious to\\naccommodate them and the whole of his letter was written\\nin so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure\\nto his cousin more especially at a moment when she was\\nsuffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her\\nnearer connections  she needed no time for deliberation\\nor inquiry  her resolution was formed as she read\\nthe situation of barton in a county so far distant from\\nsussex as devonshire which but a few hours before\\nwould have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every\\npossible advantage belonging to the place was now its\\nfirst recommendation  to quit the neighbourhood of norland\\nwas no longer an evil it was an object of desire\\nit was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing\\nher daughterinlaws guest and to remove for ever\\nfrom that beloved place would be less painful than to\\ninhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress\\nshe instantly wrote sir john middleton her acknowledgment\\nof his kindness and her acceptance of his proposal\\nand then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters\\nthat she might be secure of their approbation before her\\nanswer were sent\\n\\nelinor had always thought it would be more prudent\\nfor them to settle at some distance from norland\\nthan immediately amongst their present acquaintance\\non that head therefore it was not for her to oppose\\nher mothers intention of removing into devonshire\\nthe house too as described by sir john was on so\\nsimple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate\\nas to leave her no right of objection on either point\\nand therefore though it was not a plan which brought\\nany charm to her fancy though it was a removal from\\nthe vicinity of norland beyond her wishes she made\\nno attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter\\nof acquiescence\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 5\\n\\n\\nno sooner was her answer dispatched than mrs dashwood\\nindulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her\\nsoninlaw and his wife that she was provided with a house\\nand should incommode them no longer than till every thing were\\nready for her inhabiting it  they heard her with surprise\\nmrs john dashwood said nothing but her husband civilly\\nhoped that she would not be settled far from norland\\nshe had great satisfaction in replying that she was going\\ninto devonshireedward turned hastily towards her\\non hearing this and in a voice of surprise and concern\\nwhich required no explanation to her repeated\\ndevonshire are you indeed going there  so far from hence\\nand to what part of it  she explained the situation\\nit was within four miles northward of exeter\\n\\nit is but a cottage she continued but i hope\\nto see many of my friends in it  a room or two can\\neasily be added and if my friends find no difficulty\\nin travelling so far to see me i am sure i will find\\nnone in accommodating them\\n\\nshe concluded with a very kind invitation to\\nmr and mrs john dashwood to visit her at barton\\nand to edward she gave one with still greater affection\\nthough her late conversation with her daughterinlaw had\\nmade her resolve on remaining at norland no longer than\\nwas unavoidable it had not produced the smallest effect\\non her in that point to which it principally tended\\nto separate edward and elinor was as far from being her\\nobject as ever and she wished to show mrs john dashwood\\nby this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she\\ndisregarded her disapprobation of the match\\n\\nmr john dashwood told his mother again and again\\nhow exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at\\nsuch a distance from norland as to prevent his being of any\\nservice to her in removing her furniture  he really felt\\nconscientiously vexed on the occasion for the very exertion\\nto which he had limited the performance of his promise to\\nhis father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable\\nthe furniture was all sent around by water  it chiefly\\nconsisted of household linen plate china and books\\nwith a handsome pianoforte of mariannes  mrs john\\ndashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh she could\\nnot help feeling it hard that as mrs dashwoods income\\nwould be so trifling in comparison with their own\\nshe should have any handsome article of furniture\\n\\nmrs dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was\\nready furnished and she might have immediate possession\\nno difficulty arose on either side in the agreement and she\\nwaited only for the disposal of her effects at norland\\nand to determine her future household before she set\\noff for the west and this as she was exceedingly rapid\\nin the performance of everything that interested her\\nwas soon donethe horses which were left her by her husband\\nhad been sold soon after his death and an opportunity\\nnow offering of disposing of her carriage she agreed\\nto sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her\\neldest daughter  for the comfort of her children had she\\nconsulted only her own wishes she would have kept it\\nbut the discretion of elinor prevailed  her wisdom\\ntoo limited the number of their servants to three\\ntwo maids and a man with whom they were speedily provided\\nfrom amongst those who had formed their establishment\\nat norland\\n\\nthe man and one of the maids were sent off immediately\\ninto devonshire to prepare the house for their mistresss\\narrival for as lady middleton was entirely unknown\\nto mrs dashwood she preferred going directly to the\\ncottage to being a visitor at barton park and she relied\\nso undoubtingly on sir johns description of the house\\nas to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she\\nentered it as her own  her eagerness to be gone from norland\\nwas preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction\\nof her daughterinlaw in the prospect of her removal\\na satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed\\nunder a cold invitation to her to defer her departure\\nnow was the time when her soninlaws promise to his\\nfather might with particular propriety be fulfilled\\nsince he had neglected to do it on first coming to\\nthe estate their quitting his house might be looked\\non as the most suitable period for its accomplishment\\nbut mrs dashwood began shortly to give over every\\nhope of the kind and to be convinced from the general\\ndrift of his discourse that his assistance extended no\\nfarther than their maintenance for six months at norland\\nhe so frequently talked of the increasing expenses\\nof housekeeping and of the perpetual demands upon his purse\\nwhich a man of any consequence in the world was beyond\\ncalculation exposed to that he seemed rather to stand\\nin need of more money himself than to have any design of\\ngiving money away\\n\\nin a very few weeks from the day which brought sir\\njohn middletons first letter to norland every thing was\\nso far settled in their future abode as to enable\\nmrs dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey\\n\\nmany were the tears shed by them in their last\\nadieus to a place so much beloved  dear dear norland\\nsaid marianne as she wandered alone before the house\\non

it\\ntheir interest in the appearance of a country which they\\nwere to inhabit overcame their dejection and a view of\\nbarton valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness\\nit was a pleasant fertile spot well wooded and rich\\nin pasture  after winding along it for more than a mile\\nthey reached their own house  a small green court was\\nthe whole of its demesne in front and a neat wicket gate\\nadmitted them into it\\n\\nas a house barton cottage though small was comfortable\\nand compact but as a cottage it was defective for the\\nbuilding was regular the roof was tiled the window\\nshutters were not painted green nor were the walls covered\\nwith honeysuckles  a narrow passage led directly through\\nthe house into the garden behind  on each side of the\\nentrance was a sitting room about sixteen feet square\\nand beyond them were the offices and the stairs\\nfour bedrooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house\\nit had not been built many years and was in good repair\\nin comparison of norland it was poor and small indeedbut\\nthe tears which recollection called forth as they entered\\nthe house were soon dried away  they were cheered\\nby the joy of the servants on their arrival and each\\nfor the sake of the others resolved to appear happy\\nit was very early in september the season was fine\\nand from first seeing the place under the advantage\\nof good weather they received an impression in its\\nfavour which was of material service in recommending\\nit to their lasting approbation\\n\\nthe situation of the house was good  high hills rose\\nimmediately behind and at no great distance on each side\\nsome of which were open downs the others cultivated and woody\\nthe village of barton was chiefly on one of these hills\\nand formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows\\nthe prospect in front was more extensive it commanded the\\nwhole of the valley and reached into the country beyond\\nthe hills which surrounded the cottage terminated\\nthe valley in that direction under another name\\nand in another course it branched out again between two\\nof the steepest of them\\n\\nwith the size and furniture of the house mrs dashwood\\nwas upon the whole well satisfied for though her former\\nstyle of life rendered many additions to the latter\\nindispensable yet to add and improve was a delight to her\\nand she had at this time ready money enough to supply all\\nthat was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments\\nas for the house itself to be sure said she it is\\ntoo small for our family but we will make ourselves\\ntolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late\\nin the year for improvements  perhaps in the spring\\nif i have plenty of money as i dare say i shall we may\\nthink about building  these parlors are both too small\\nfor such parties of our friends as i hope to see often\\ncollected here and i have some thoughts of throwing the\\npassage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other\\nand so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance\\nthis with a new drawing room which may be easily added\\nand a bedchamber and garret above will make it a very snug\\nlittle cottage  i could wish the stairs were handsome\\nbut one must not expect every thing though i suppose it\\nwould be no difficult matter to widen them  i shall see\\nhow much i am beforehand with the world in the spring\\nand we will plan our improvements accordingly\\n\\nin the mean time till all these alterations could\\nbe made from the savings of an income of five hundred\\nayear by a woman who never saved in her life they were\\nwise enough to be contented with the house as it was\\nand each of them was busy in arranging their particular\\nconcerns and endeavoring by placing around them books\\nand other possessions to form themselves a home\\nmariannes pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of\\nand elinors drawings were affixed to the walls of their\\nsitting room\\n\\nin such employments as these they were interrupted\\nsoon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of\\ntheir landlord who called to welcome them to barton\\nand to offer them every accommodation from his own house\\nand garden in which theirs might at present be deficient\\nsir john middleton was a good looking man about forty\\nhe had formerly visited at stanhill but it was too long\\nfor his young cousins to remember him  his countenance\\nwas thoroughly goodhumoured and his manners were\\nas friendly as the style of his letter  their arrival\\nseemed to afford him real satisfaction and their comfort\\nto be an object of real solicitude to him  he said much\\nof his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable\\nterms with his family and pressed them so cordially\\nto dine at barton park every day till they were better\\nsettled at home that though his entreaties were carried\\nto a point of perseverance beyond civility they could\\nnot give offence  his kindness was not confined to words\\nfor within an hour after he left them a large basket\\nfull of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park\\nwhich was followed before the end of the day by a present\\nof game  he insisted moreover on conveying all their\\nletters to and from the post for them and would not be\\ndenied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper\\nevery day\\n\\nlady middleton had sent a very civil message by him\\ndenoting her intention of waiting on mrs dashwood as soon as\\nshe could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience\\nand as this message was answered by an invitation\\nequally polite her ladyship was introduced to them the next day\\n\\nthey were of course very anxious to see a person on\\nwhom so much of their comfort at barton must depend and the\\nelegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes\\nlady middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty\\nher face was handsome her figure tall and striking\\nand her address graceful  her manners had all the elegance\\nwhich her husbands wanted  but they would have been\\nimproved by some share of his frankness and warmth\\nand her visit was long enough to detract something from\\ntheir first admiration by shewing that though perfectly\\nwellbred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say\\nfor herself beyond the most commonplace inquiry or remark\\n\\nconversation however was not wanted for sir john\\nwas very chatty and lady middleton had taken the wise\\nprecaution of bringing with her their eldest child a fine\\nlittle boy about six years old by which means there was\\none subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case\\nof extremity for they had to enquire his name and age\\nadmire his beauty and ask him questions which his mother\\nanswered for him while he hung about her and held\\ndown his head to the great surprise of her ladyship\\nwho wondered at his being so shy before company as he\\ncould make noise enough at home  on every formal visit\\na child ought to be of the party by way of provision\\nfor discourse  in the present case it took up ten minutes\\nto determine whether the boy were most like his father\\nor mother and in what particular he resembled either\\nfor of course every body differed and every body was\\nastonished at the opinion of the others\\n\\nan opportunity was soon to be given to the dashwoods\\nof debating on the rest of the children as sir john\\nwould not leave the house without securing their promise\\nof dining at the park the next day\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 7\\n\\n\\nbarton park was about half a mile from the cottage\\nthe ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley\\nbut it was screened from their view at home by the\\nprojection of a hill  the house was large and handsome\\nand the middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality\\nand elegance  the former was for sir johns gratification\\nthe latter for that of his lady  they were scarcely\\never without some friends staying with them in the house\\nand they kept more company of every kind than any other\\nfamily in the neighbourhood  it was necessary to the\\nhappiness of both for however dissimilar in temper\\nand outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other\\nin that total want of talent and taste which confined\\ntheir employments unconnected with such as society produced\\nwithin a very narrow compass  sir john was a sportsman\\nlady middleton a mother  he hunted and shot and she\\nhumoured her children and these were their only resources\\nlady middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her\\nchildren all the year round while sir johns independent\\nemployments were in existence only half the time\\ncontinual engagements at home and abroad however\\nsupplied all the deficiencies of nature and education\\nsupported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise\\nto the good breeding of his wife\\n\\nlady middleton piqued herself upon the elegance\\nof her table and of all her domestic arrangements\\nand from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment\\nin any of their parties  but sir johns satisfaction\\nin society was much more real he delighted in collecting\\nabout him more young people than his house would hold\\nand the noisier they were the better was he pleased\\nhe was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood\\nfor in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold\\nham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private\\nballs were numerous enough for any young lady who was not\\nsuffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen\\n\\nthe arrival of a new family in the country was always\\na matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was\\ncharmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his\\ncottage at barton  the miss dashwoods were young pretty\\nand unaffected  it was enough to secure his good opinion\\nfor to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could\\nwant to make her mind as captivating as her person\\nthe friendliness of his disposition made him happy in\\naccommodating those whose situation might be considered\\nin comparison with the past as unfortunate  in showing\\nkindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction\\nof a good heart and in settling a family of females only\\nin his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman\\nfor a sportsman though he esteems only those of his sex who\\nare sportsmen likewise is not often desirous of encouraging\\ntheir taste by admitting them to a residence within his own\\nmanor\\n\\nmrs dashwood and her daughters were met at the door\\nof the house by sir john who welcomed them to barton\\npark with unaffected sincerity and as he attended them\\nto the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern\\nwhich the same subject had drawn from him the day before\\nat being unable to get any smart young men to meet them\\nthey would see he said only one gentleman there\\nbesides himself a particular friend who was staying at\\nthe park but who was neither very young nor very gay\\nhe hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party\\nand could assure them it should never happen so again\\nhe had been to several families that morning in hopes\\nof procuring some addition to their number but it\\nwas moonlight and every body was full of engagements\\nluckily lady middletons mother had arrived at barton\\nwithin the last hour and as she was a very cheerful\\nagreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not find\\nit so very dull as they might imagine  the young ladies\\nas well as their mother were perfectly satisfied with\\nhaving two entire strangers of the party and wished for\\nno more\\n\\nmrs jennings lady middletons mother was a\\ngoodhumoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a\\ngreat deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar  she was full\\nof jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said\\nmany witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands\\nhoped they had not left their hearts behind them in sussex\\nand pretended to see them blush whether they did or not\\nmarianne was vexed at it for her sisters sake and turned\\nher eyes towards elinor to see how she bore these attacks\\nwith an earnestness which gave elinor far more pain than\\ncould arise from such commonplace raillery as mrs jenningss\\n\\ncolonel brandon the friend of sir john seemed no\\nmore adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend\\nthan lady middleton was to be his wife or mrs jennings\\nto be lady middletons mother  he was silent and grave\\nhis appearance however was not unpleasing in spite\\nof his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret\\nan absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side\\nof five and thirty but though his face was not handsome\\nhis countenance was sensible and his address was\\nparticularly gentlemanlike\\n\\nthere was nothing in any of the party which could\\nrecommend them as companions to the dashwoods but the cold\\ninsipidity of lady middleton was so particularly repulsive\\nthat in comparison of it the gravity of colonel brandon\\nand even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his\\nmotherinlaw was interesting  lady middleton seemed\\nto be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her\\nfour noisy children after dinner who pulled her about\\ntore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse\\nexcept what related to themselves\\n\\nin the evening as marianne was discovered to be musical\\nshe was invited to play  the instrument was unlocked\\nevery body prepared to be charmed and marianne\\nwho sang very well at their request went through the\\nchief of the songs which lady middleton had brought into\\nthe family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain\\never since in the same position on the pianoforte\\nfor her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving\\nup music although by her mothers account she had\\nplayed extremely well and by her own was very fond of it\\n\\nmariannes performance was highly applauded\\nsir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every song\\nand as loud in his conversation with the others while every\\nsong lasted  lady middleton frequently called him to order\\nwondered how any ones attention could be diverted from music\\nfor a moment and asked marianne to sing a particular song\\nwhich marianne had just finished  colonel brandon alone\\nof all the party heard her without being in raptures\\nhe paid her only the compliment of attention and she felt\\na respect for him on the occasion which the others had\\nreasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste\\nhis pleasure in music though it amounted not to that\\necstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own\\nwas estimable when contrasted against the horrible\\ninsensibility of the others and she was reasonable enough\\nto allow that a man of five and thirty might well have\\noutlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite\\npower of enjoyment  she was perfectly disposed to make\\nevery allowance for the colonels advanced state of life\\nwhich humanity required\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 8\\n\\n\\nmrs jennings was a widow with an ample jointure\\nshe had only two daughters both of whom she had lived\\nto see respectably married and she had now therefore\\nnothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world\\nin the promotion of this object she was zealously active\\nas far as her ability reached and missed no opportunity\\nof projecting weddings among all the young people\\nof her acquaintance  she was remarkably quick in the\\ndiscovery of attachments and had enjoyed the advantage\\nof raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young\\nlady by insinuations of her power over such a young man\\nand this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her\\narrival at barton decisively to pronounce that colonel\\nbrandon was very much in love with marianne dashwood\\nshe rather suspected it to be so on the very first\\nevening of their being together from his listening\\nso attentively while she sang to them and when the visit\\nwas returned by the middletons dining at the cottage\\nthe fact was ascertained by his listening to her again\\nit must be so  she was perfectly convinced of it\\nit would be an excellent match for he was rich and she\\nwas handsome  mrs jennings had been anxious to see\\ncolonel brandon well married ever since her connection\\nwith sir john first brought him to her knowledge\\nand she was always anxious to get a good husband for every\\npretty girl\\n\\nthe immediate advantage to herself was by no means\\ninconsiderable for it supplied her with endless jokes\\nagainst them both  at the park she laughed at the colonel\\nand in the cottage at marianne  to the former her\\nraillery was probably as far as it regarded only himself\\nperfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at\\nfirst incomprehensible and when its object was understood\\nshe hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity\\nor censure its impertinence for she considered it as an\\nunfeeling reflection on the colonels advanced years\\nand on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor\\n\\nmrs dashwood who could not think a man five years\\nyounger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared\\nto the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear\\nmrs jennings from the probability of wishing to throw\\nridicule on his age\\n\\nbut at least mamma you cannot deny the absurdity\\nof the accusation though you may not think it intentionally\\nillnatured  colonel brandon is certainly younger than\\nmrs jennings but he is old enough to be my father\\nand if he were ever animated enough to be in love\\nmust have long outlived every sensation of the kind\\nit is too ridiculous  when is a man to be safe from such wit\\nif age and infirmity will not protect him\\n\\ninfirmity said elinor do you call colonel brandon\\ninfirm  i can easily suppose that his age may appear much\\ngreater to you than to my mother but you can hardly\\ndeceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs\\n\\ndid not you hear him complain of the rheumatism\\nand is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life\\n\\nmy dearest child said her mother laughing\\nat this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay\\nand it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been\\nextended to the advanced age of forty\\n\\nmamma you are not doing me justice  i know very well\\nthat colonel brandon is not old enough to make his friends\\nyet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature\\nhe may live twenty years longer  but thirtyfive has\\nnothing to do with matrimony\\n\\nperhaps said elinor thirtyfive and seventeen had\\nbetter not have any thing to do with matrimony together\\nbut if there should by any chance happen to be a woman\\nwho is single at seven and twenty i should not think\\ncolonel brandons being thirtyfive any objection to his\\nmarrying her\\n\\na woman of seven and twenty said marianne\\nafter pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inspire\\naffection again and if her home be uncomfortable\\nor her fortune small i can suppose that she might\\nbring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse\\nfor the sake of the provision and security of a wife\\nin his marrying such a woman therefore there would be\\nnothing unsuitable  it would be a compact of convenience\\nand the world would be satisfied  in my eyes it would\\nbe no marriage at all but that would be nothing\\nto me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which\\neach wished to be benefited at the expense of the other\\n\\nit would be impossible i know replied elinor\\nto convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could\\nfeel for a man of thirtyfive anything near enough\\nto love to make him a desirable companion to her\\nbut i must object to your dooming colonel brandon and\\nhis wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber\\nmerely because he chanced to complain yesterday a\\nvery cold damp day of a slight rheumatic feel in one\\nof his shoulders\\n\\nbut he talked of flannel waistcoats said marianne\\nand with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected\\nwith aches cramps rheumatisms and every species of\\nailment that can afflict the old and the feeble\\n\\nhad he been only in a violent fever you would not\\nhave despised him half so much  confess marianne is not\\nthere something interesting to you in the flushed cheek\\nhollow eye and quick pulse of a fever\\n\\nsoon after this upon elinors leaving the room\\nmamma said marianne i have an alarm on the subject\\nof illness which i cannot conceal from you  i am sure\\nedward ferrars is not well  we have now been here almost\\na fortnight and yet he does not come  nothing but real\\nindisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay\\nwhat else can detain him at norland\\n\\nhad you any idea of his coming so soon\\nsaid mrs dashwood  i had none  on the contrary\\nif i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has\\nbeen in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want\\nof pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation\\nwhen i talked of his coming to barton  does elinor\\nexpect him already\\n\\ni have never mentioned it to her but of course\\nshe must\\n\\ni rather think you are mistaken for when i\\nwas talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate\\nfor the spare bedchamber she observed that there\\nwas no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely\\nthat the room would be wanted for some time\\n\\nhow strange this is what can be the meaning of it\\nbut the whole of their behaviour to each other has been\\nunaccountable how cold how composed were their last\\nadieus how languid their conversation the last evening\\nof their being together in edwards farewell there was no\\ndistinction between elinor and me it was the good wishes\\nof an affectionate brother to both  twice did i leave\\nthem purposely together in the course of the last morning\\nand each time did he most unaccountably follow me out\\nof the room  and elinor in quitting norland and edward\\ncried not as i did  even now her selfcommand is invariable\\nwhen is she dejected or melancholy when does

norland had been able to afford since the\\nloss of their father  sir john middleton who called\\non them every day for the first fortnight and who was\\nnot in the habit of seeing much occupation at home\\ncould not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed\\n\\ntheir visitors except those from barton park\\nwere not many for in spite of sir johns urgent entreaties\\nthat they would mix more in the neighbourhood and repeated\\nassurances of his carriage being always at their service\\nthe independence of mrs dashwoods spirit overcame the\\nwish of society for her children and she was resolute\\nin declining to visit any family beyond the distance\\nof a walk  there were but few who could be so classed\\nand it was not all of them that were attainable\\nabout a mile and a half from the cottage along the narrow\\nwinding valley of allenham which issued from that of barton\\nas formerly described the girls had in one of their\\nearliest walks discovered an ancient respectable looking\\nmansion which by reminding them a little of norland\\ninterested their imagination and made them wish to be\\nbetter acquainted with it  but they learnt on enquiry\\nthat its possessor an elderly lady of very good character\\nwas unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world\\nand never stirred from home\\n\\nthe whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks\\nthe high downs which invited them from almost every window\\nof the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air\\non their summits were a happy alternative when the dirt\\nof the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties\\nand towards one of these hills did marianne and margaret\\none memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the\\npartial sunshine of a showery sky and unable longer to bear\\nthe confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding\\ndays had occasioned  the weather was not tempting enough\\nto draw the two others from their pencil and their book\\nin spite of mariannes declaration that the day would\\nbe lastingly fair and that every threatening cloud would\\nbe drawn off from their hills and the two girls set off\\ntogether\\n\\nthey gaily ascended the downs rejoicing in their own\\npenetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they\\ncaught in their faces the animating gales of a high\\nsouthwesterly wind they pitied the fears which had prevented\\ntheir mother and elinor from sharing such delightful sensations\\n\\nis there a felicity in the world said marianne\\nsuperior to thismargaret we will walk here at least\\ntwo hours\\n\\nmargaret agreed and they pursued their way against\\nthe wind resisting it with laughing delight for about\\ntwenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over\\ntheir heads and a driving rain set full in their face\\nchagrined and surprised they were obliged though unwillingly\\nto turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own house\\none consolation however remained for them to which the\\nexigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety\\nit was that of running with all possible speed down the steep\\nside of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate\\n\\nthey set off  marianne had at first the advantage\\nbut a false step brought her suddenly to the ground\\nand margaret unable to stop herself to assist her\\nwas involuntarily hurried along and reached the bottom\\nin safety\\n\\na gentleman carrying a gun with two pointers\\nplaying round him was passing up the hill and within\\na few yards of marianne when her accident happened\\nhe put down his gun and ran to her assistance  she had\\nraised herself from the ground but her foot had been\\ntwisted in her fall and she was scarcely able to stand\\nthe gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her\\nmodesty declined what her situation rendered necessary\\ntook her up in his arms without farther delay and carried\\nher down the hill  then passing through the garden\\nthe gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her\\ndirectly into the house whither margaret was just arrived\\nand quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair\\nin the parlour\\n\\nelinor and her mother rose up in amazement at\\ntheir entrance and while the eyes of both were fixed\\non him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration\\nwhich equally sprung from his appearance he apologized\\nfor his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner\\nso frank and so graceful that his person which was\\nuncommonly handsome received additional charms from his voice\\nand expression  had he been even old ugly and vulgar\\nthe gratitude and kindness of mrs dashwood would\\nhave been secured by any act of attention to her child\\nbut the influence of youth beauty and elegance\\ngave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings\\n\\nshe thanked him again and again and with a sweetness\\nof address which always attended her invited him to\\nbe seated  but this he declined as he was dirty and wet\\nmrs dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged\\nhis name he replied was willoughby and his present\\nhome was at allenham from whence he hoped she would\\nallow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire\\nafter miss dashwood  the honour was readily granted\\nand he then departed to make himself still more interesting\\nin the midst of a heavy rain\\n\\nhis manly beauty and more than common gracefulness\\nwere instantly the theme of general admiration\\nand the laugh which his gallantry raised against marianne\\nreceived particular spirit from his exterior attractions\\nmarianne herself had seen less of his person that the rest\\nfor the confusion which crimsoned over her face on his\\nlifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding\\nhim after their entering the house  but she had seen\\nenough of him to join in all the admiration of the others\\nand with an energy which always adorned her praise\\nhis person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever\\ndrawn for the hero of a favourite story and in his carrying\\nher into the house with so little previous formality there\\nwas a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended\\nthe action to her  every circumstance belonging to him\\nwas interesting  his name was good his residence was in\\ntheir favourite village and she soon found out that of all\\nmanly dresses a shootingjacket was the most becoming\\nher imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant\\nand the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded\\n\\nsir john called on them as soon as the next interval\\nof fair weather that morning allowed him to get out\\nof doors and mariannes accident being related to him\\nhe was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman\\nof the name of willoughby at allenham\\n\\nwilloughby cried sir john what is he\\nin the country that is good news however i will\\nride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on thursday\\n\\nyou know him then said mrs dashwood\\n\\nknow him to be sure i do  why he is down here\\nevery year\\n\\nand what sort of a young man is he\\n\\nas good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you\\na very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider\\nin england\\n\\nand is that all you can say for him cried marianne\\nindignantly  but what are his manners on more intimate\\nacquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius\\n\\nsir john was rather puzzled\\n\\nupon my soul said he i do not know much about him\\nas to all that  but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow\\nand has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer\\ni ever saw  was she out with him today\\n\\nbut marianne could no more satisfy him as to the\\ncolour of mr willoughbys pointer than he could\\ndescribe to her the shades of his mind\\n\\nbut who is he said elinor  where does he come\\nfrom  has he a house at allenham\\n\\non this point sir john could give more certain intelligence\\nand he told them that mr willoughby had no property\\nof his own in the country that he resided there only\\nwhile he was visiting the old lady at allenham court\\nto whom he was related and whose possessions he was\\nto inherit adding yes yes he is very well worth\\ncatching i can tell you miss dashwood he has a pretty\\nlittle estate of his own in somersetshire besides\\nand if i were you i would not give him up to my\\nyounger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills\\nmiss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself\\nbrandon will be jealous if she does not take care\\n\\ni do not believe said mrs dashwood with a\\ngood humoured smile that mr willoughby will be incommoded\\nby the attempts of either of my daughters towards what\\nyou call catching him  it is not an employment to which\\nthey have been brought up  men are very safe with us\\nlet them be ever so rich  i am glad to find however\\nfrom what you say that he is a respectable young man\\nand one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible\\n\\nhe is as good a sort of fellow i believe\\nas ever lived repeated sir john  i remember\\nlast christmas at a little hop at the park he danced\\nfrom eight oclock till four without once sitting down\\n\\ndid he indeed cried marianne with sparkling eyes\\nand with elegance with spirit\\n\\nyes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert\\n\\nthat is what i like that is what a young man ought\\nto be  whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them\\nshould know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue\\n\\naye aye i see how it will be said sir john i see\\nhow it will be  you will be setting your cap at him now\\nand never think of poor brandon\\n\\nthat is an expression sir john said marianne\\nwarmly which i particularly dislike  i abhor every\\ncommonplace phrase by which wit is intended and setting\\nones cap at a man or making a conquest are the most\\nodious of all  their tendency is gross and illiberal\\nand if their construction could ever be deemed clever\\ntime has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity\\n\\nsir john did not much understand this reproof\\nbut he laughed as heartily as if he did and then replied\\n\\nay you will make conquests enough i dare say\\none way or other  poor brandon he is quite smitten already\\nand he is very well worth setting your cap at i can\\ntell you in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining\\nof ankles\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 10\\n\\n\\nmariannes preserver as margaret with more elegance\\nthan precision styled willoughby called at the cottage\\nearly the next morning to make his personal enquiries\\nhe was received by mrs dashwood with more than politeness\\nwith a kindness which sir johns account of him and her own\\ngratitude prompted and every thing that passed during\\nthe visit tended to assure him of the sense elegance\\nmutual affection and domestic comfort of the family\\nto whom accident had now introduced him  of their\\npersonal charms he had not required a second interview\\nto be convinced\\n\\nmiss dashwood had a delicate complexion\\nregular features and a remarkably pretty figure\\nmarianne was still handsomer  her form though not so\\ncorrect as her sisters in having the advantage of height\\nwas more striking and her face was so lovely that when\\nin the common cant of praise she was called a beautiful girl\\ntruth was less violently outraged than usually happens\\nher skin was very brown but from its transparency\\nher complexion was uncommonly brilliant her features\\nwere all good her smile was sweet and attractive\\nand in her eyes which were very dark there was a life\\na spirit an eagerness which could hardily be seen\\nwithout delight  from willoughby their expression was at\\nfirst held back by the embarrassment which the remembrance\\nof his assistance created  but when this passed away\\nwhen her spirits became collected when she saw that to the\\nperfect goodbreeding of the gentleman he united frankness\\nand vivacity and above all when she heard him declare\\nthat of music and dancing he was passionately fond\\nshe gave him such a look of approbation as secured the\\nlargest share of his discourse to herself for the rest\\nof his stay\\n\\nit was only necessary to mention any favourite\\namusement to engage her to talk  she could not be\\nsilent when such points were introduced and she\\nhad neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion\\nthey speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing\\nand music was mutual and that it arose from a general\\nconformity of judgment in all that related to either\\nencouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions\\nshe proceeded to question him on the subject of books\\nher favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt\\nupon with so rapturous a delight that any young man of\\nfive and twenty must have been insensible indeed not to\\nbecome an immediate convert to the excellence of such works\\nhowever disregarded before  their taste was strikingly alike\\nthe same books the same passages were idolized by each\\nor if any difference appeared any objection arose\\nit lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments\\nand the brightness of her eyes could be displayed\\nhe acquiesced in all her decisions caught all her enthusiasm\\nand long before his visit concluded they conversed\\nwith the familiarity of a longestablished acquaintance\\n\\nwell marianne said elinor as soon as he had left them\\nfor one morning i think you have done pretty well\\nyou have already ascertained mr willoughbys opinion in\\nalmost every matter of importance  you know what he thinks\\nof cowper and scott you are certain of his estimating\\ntheir beauties as he ought and you have received every\\nassurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper\\nbut how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such\\nextraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse\\nyou will soon have exhausted each favourite topic\\nanother meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments\\non picturesque beauty and second marriages and then\\nyou can have nothing farther to ask\\n\\nelinor cried marianne is this fair is this\\njust are my ideas so scanty  but i see what you mean\\ni have been too much at my ease too happy too frank\\ni have erred against every commonplace notion of decorum\\ni have been open and sincere where i ought to have\\nbeen reserved spiritless dull and deceitfulhad\\ni talked only of the weather and the roads and had i\\nspoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have\\nbeen spared\\n\\nmy love said her mother you must not be offended\\nwith elinorshe was only in jest  i should scold\\nher myself if she were capable of wishing to check\\nthe delight of your conversation with our new friend\\nmarianne was softened in a moment\\n\\nwilloughby on his side gave every proof of his\\npleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish\\nof improving it could offer  he came to them every day\\nto enquire after marianne was at first his excuse but the\\nencouragement of his reception to which every day gave\\ngreater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it\\nhad ceased to be possible by mariannes perfect recovery\\nshe was confined for some days to the house but never had\\nany confinement been less irksome  willoughby was a young\\nman of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits\\nand open affectionate manners  he was exactly formed\\nto engage mariannes heart for with all this he joined\\nnot only a captivating person but a natural ardour\\nof mind which was now roused and increased by the example\\nof her own and which recommended him to her affection\\nbeyond every thing else\\n\\nhis society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment\\nthey read they talked they sang together his musical\\ntalents were considerable and he read with all the\\nsensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted\\n\\nin mrs dashwoods estimation he was as faultless\\nas in mariannes and elinor saw nothing to censure in him\\nbut a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly\\ndelighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on\\nevery occasion without attention to persons or circumstances\\nin hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people\\nin sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment\\nof undivided attention where his heart was engaged\\nand in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety\\nhe displayed a want of caution which elinor could not approve\\nin spite of all that he and marianne could say in its support\\n\\nmarianne began now to perceive that the desperation\\nwhich had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever\\nseeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection\\nhad been rash and unjustifiable  willoughby was all\\nthat her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour\\nand in every brighter period as capable of attaching her\\nand his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect\\nas earnest as his abilities were strong\\n\\nher mother too in whose mind not one speculative\\nthought of their marriage had been raised by his prospect\\nof riches was led before the end of a week to hope and\\nexpect it and secretly to congratulate herself on having\\ngained two such sonsinlaw as edward and willoughby\\n\\ncolonel brandons partiality for marianne which had\\nso early been discovered by his friends now first became\\nperceptible to elinor when it ceased to be noticed\\nby them  their attention and wit were drawn off to his\\nmore fortunate rival and the raillery which the other\\nhad incurred before any partiality arose was removed\\nwhen his feelings began really to call for the ridicule\\nso justly annexed to sensibility  elinor was obliged\\nthough unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which\\nmrs jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction\\nwere now actually excited by her sister and that however\\na general resemblance of disposition between the parties\\nmight forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally\\nstriking opposition of character was no hindrance to the\\nregard of colonel brandon  she saw it with concern\\nfor what could a silent man of five and thirty hope\\nwhen opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty and as\\nshe could not even wish him successful she heartily wished\\nhim indifferent  she liked himin spite of his gravity\\nand reserve she beheld in him an object of interest\\nhis manners though serious were mild and his reserve\\nappeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits\\nthan of any natural gloominess of temper  sir john\\nhad dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments\\nwhich justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man\\nand she regarded him with respect and compassion\\n\\nperhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more\\nbecause he was slighted by willoughby and marianne\\nwho prejudiced against him for being neither lively\\nnor young seemed resolved to undervalue his merits\\n\\nbrandon is just the kind of man said willoughby\\none day when they were talking of him together\\nwhom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about\\nwhom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers\\nto talk to\\n\\nthat is exactly what i think of him cried marianne\\n\\ndo not boast of it however said elinor for it\\nis injustice in both of you  he is highly esteemed\\nby all the family at the park and i never see him myself\\nwithout taking pains to converse with him\\n\\nthat he is patronised by you replied willoughby\\nis certainly in his favour but as for the esteem\\nof the others it is a reproach in itself  who would\\nsubmit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman\\nas lady middleton and mrs jennings that could command\\nthe indifference of any body else\\n\\nbut perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself\\nand marianne will make amends for the regard of lady\\nmiddleton and her mother  if their praise is censure\\nyour censure may be praise for they are not more undiscerning\\nthan you are prejudiced and unjust\\n\\nin defence of your protege you can even be saucy\\n\\nmy protege as you call him is a sensible man\\nand sense will always have attractions for me\\nyes marianne even in a man between thirty and forty\\nhe has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad\\nhas read and has a thinking mind  i have found him\\ncapable of giving me much information on various subjects\\nand he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of\\ngoodbreeding and good nature\\n\\nthat is to say cried marianne contemptuously\\nhe has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot\\nand the mosquitoes are troublesome\\n\\nhe would have told me so i doubt not had i made\\nany such inquiries but they happened to be points\\non which i had been previously informed\\n\\nperhaps said willoughby his observations may\\nhave extended to the existence of nabobs gold mohrs\\nand palanquins\\n\\ni may venture to say that his observations\\nhave stretched much further than your candour\\nbut why should you dislike him\\n\\ni do not dislike him  i consider him on the contrary\\nas a very respectable man who has every bodys good word\\nand nobodys notice who has more money than he can spend\\nmore time than he knows how to employ and two new coats\\nevery year\\n\\nadd to which cried marianne that he has\\nneither genius taste nor spirit  that his understanding\\nhas no brilliancy his feelings no ardour and his voice\\nno expression\\n\\nyou decide on his imperfections so much in the mass\\nreplied elinor and so much on the strength of your\\nown imagination that the commendation i am able to give\\nof him is comparatively cold and insipid  i can only\\npronounce him to be a sensible man wellbred wellinformed\\nof gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart\\n\\nmiss dashwood cried willoughby you are now using\\nme unkindly  you are endeavouring to disarm me by reason\\nand to convince me against my will  but it will not do\\nyou shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful  i have\\nthree unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon\\nhe threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine\\nhe has found fault with the hanging of my curricle\\nand i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare  if it\\nwill be any satisfaction to you however to be told\\nthat i believe his character to be in other respects\\nirreproachable i am ready to confess it  and in return\\nfor an acknowledgment which must give me some pain\\nyou cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much\\nas ever\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 11\\n\\n\\nlittle had mrs dashwood or her daughters imagined\\nwhen they first came into devonshire that so many\\nengagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly\\npresented themselves or that they should have such frequent\\ninvitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little\\nleisure for serious employment  yet such was the case\\nwhen marianne was recovered the schemes of amusement at home\\nand abroad which sir john had been previously forming\\nwere put into execution  the private balls at the park\\nthen began and parties on the water were made and\\naccomplished as often as a showery october would allow\\nin every meeting of the kind willoughby was included\\nand the ease and familiarity which naturally attended\\nthese parties were exactly calculated to give increasing\\nintimacy to his acquaintance with the dashwoods to afford\\nhim opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of marianne\\nof marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving\\nin her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance\\nof her affection\\n\\nelinor could not be surprised at their attachment\\nshe only wished that it were less openly shewn and once\\nor twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some\\nselfcommand to marianne  but marianne abhorred all\\nconcealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve\\nand to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not\\nin themselves illaudable appeared to her not merely\\nan unnecessary effort but a disgraceful subjection\\nof reason to commonplace and mistaken notions\\nwilloughby thought the same and their behaviour at\\nall times was an illustration of their opinions\\n\\nwhen he was present she had no eyes for any one else\\nevery thing he did was right  every thing he said was clever\\nif their evenings at the park were concluded with cards\\nhe cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get\\nher a good hand  if dancing formed the amusement\\nof the night they were partners for half the time\\nand when obliged to separate for a couple of dances\\nwere careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word\\nto any body else  such conduct made them of course\\nmost exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame\\nand seemed hardly to provoke them\\n\\nmrs dashwood entered into all their feelings with\\na warmth which left her no inclination for checking this\\nexcessive display of them  to her it was but the natural\\nconsequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind\\n\\nthis was the season of happiness to marianne\\nher heart was devoted to willoughby and the fond attachment\\nto norland which she brought with her from sussex\\nwas more likely to be softened than she had thought it\\npossible before by the charms which his society bestowed\\non her present home\\n\\nelinors happiness was not so great  her heart was not\\nso much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements\\nso pure  they afforded her no companion that could make\\namends for what she had left behind nor that could teach\\nher to think of norland with less regret than ever\\nneither lady middleton nor mrs jennings could supply\\nto her the conversation she missed although the latter\\nwas an everlasting talker and from the first had regarded\\nher with a kindness which ensured her a large share of\\nher discourse  she had already repeated her own history\\nto elinor three or four times and had elinors memory been\\nequal to her means of improvement she might have known\\nvery early in their acquaintance all the particulars of\\nmr jennings last illness and what he said to his wife\\na few minutes before he died  lady middleton was more\\nagreeable than her mother only in being more silent\\nelinor needed little observation to perceive that her\\nreserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense\\nhad nothing to do  towards her husband and mother she\\nwas the same as to them and intimacy was therefore\\nneither to be looked for nor desired  she had nothing\\nto say one day that she had not said the day before\\nher insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were\\nalways the same and though she did not oppose the parties\\narranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted\\nin style and her two eldest children attended her\\nshe never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them\\nthan she might have experienced in sitting at home\\nand so little did her presence add to the pleasure\\nof the others by any share in their conversation\\nthat they were sometimes only reminded of her being\\namongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys\\n\\nin colonel brandon alone of all her new acquaintance\\ndid elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the\\nrespect of abilities excite the interest of friendship\\nor give pleasure as a companion  willoughby was out\\nof the question  her admiration and regard even her\\nsisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover\\nhis attentions were wholly mariannes and a far less\\nagreeable man might have been more generally pleasing\\ncolonel brandon unfortunately for himself had no such\\nencouragement to think only of marianne and in conversing\\nwith elinor he found the greatest consolation for the\\nindifference of her sister\\n\\nelinors compassion for him increased as she had reason\\nto suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already\\nbeen known to him  this suspicion was given by some words\\nwhich accidently dropped from him one evening at the park\\nwhen they were sitting down together by mutual consent\\nwhile the others were dancing  his eyes were fixed\\non marianne and after a silence of some minutes\\nhe said with a faint smile your sister i understand\\ndoes not approve of second attachments\\n\\nno replied elinor her opinions are all romantic\\n\\nor rather as i believe she considers them\\nimpossible to exist\\n\\ni believe she does  but how she contrives it\\nwithout reflecting on the character of her own father\\nwho had himself two wives i know not  a few years\\nhowever will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis\\nof common sense and observation and then they may be\\nmore easy to define and to justify than they now are\\nby any body but herself\\n\\nthis will probably be the case he replied\\nand yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices\\nof a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way\\nto the reception of more general opinions\\n\\ni cannot agree with you there said elinor\\nthere are inconveniences attending such feelings\\nas mariannes which all the charms of enthusiasm and\\nignorance of the world cannot atone for  her systems have\\nall the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought\\nand a better acquaintance with the world is what i look\\nforward to as her greatest possible advantage\\n\\nafter a short pause he resumed the conversation\\nby saying\\n\\ndoes your sister make no distinction in her objections\\nagainst a second attachment or is it equally criminal\\nin every body  are those who have been disappointed\\nin their first choice whether from the inconstancy\\nof its object or the perverseness of circumstances\\nto be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives\\n\\nupon my word i am not acquainted with the minutiae\\nof her principles  i only know that i never yet heard her\\nadmit any instance of a second attachments being pardonable\\n\\nthis said he cannot hold but a change\\na total change of sentimentsno no do not desire it\\nfor when the romantic refinements of a young mind\\nare obliged to give way how frequently are they\\nsucceeded by such opinions as are but too common and too\\ndangerous  i speak from experience  i once knew a lady\\nwho in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister\\nwho thought and judged like her but who from an inforced\\nchangefrom a series of unfortunate circumstances\\nhere he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said\\ntoo much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures\\nwhich might not otherwise have entered elinors head\\nthe lady would probably have passed without suspicion\\nhad he not convinced miss dashwood that what concerned\\nher ought not to escape his lips  as it was\\nit required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his\\nemotion with the tender recollection of past regard\\nelinor attempted no more  but marianne in her place\\nwould not have done so little  the whole story would\\nhave been speedily formed under her active imagination\\nand every thing established in the most melancholy order\\nof disastrous love\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 12\\n\\n\\nas elinor and marianne were walking together the\\nnext morning the latter communicated a piece of news\\nto her sister which in spite of all that she knew\\nbefore of mariannes imprudence and want of thought\\nsurprised her by its extravagant testimony of both\\nmarianne told her with the greatest delight that\\nwilloughby had given her a horse one that he had bred\\nhimself on his estate in somersetshire and which was\\nexactly calculated to carry a woman  without considering\\nthat it was not in her mothers plan to keep any horse\\nthat if she were to alter her resolution in favour of\\nthis gift she must buy another for the servant and\\nkeep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable\\nto receive them she had accepted the present without\\nhesitation and told her sister of it in raptures\\n\\nhe intends to send his groom into somersetshire\\nimmediately for it she added and when it arrives we\\nwill ride every day  you shall share its use with me\\nimagine to yourself my dear elinor the delight of a gallop\\non some of these downs\\n\\nmost unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of\\nfelicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended\\nthe affair and for some time she refused to submit to them\\nas to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle\\nmamma she was sure would never object to it and any horse\\nwould do for him he might always get one at the park\\nas to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient\\nelinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving\\nsuch a present from a man so little or at least so lately\\nknown to her  this was too much\\n\\nyou are mistaken elinor said she warmly\\nin supposing i know very little of willoughby\\ni have not known him long indeed but i am much better\\nacquainted with him than i am with any other creature\\nin the world except yourself and mama  it is not\\ntime or opportunity that is to determine intimacy\\nit is disposition alone  seven years would be insufficient\\nto make some people acquainted with each other and seven\\ndays are more than enough for others  i should hold\\nmyself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse\\nfrom my brother than from willoughby  of john i know\\nvery little though we have lived together for years\\nbut of willoughby my judgment has long been formed\\n\\nelinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more\\nshe knew her sisters temper  opposition on so tender a\\nsubject would only attach her the more to her own opinion\\nbut by an appeal to her affection for her mother\\nby representing the inconveniences which that indulgent\\nmother must draw on herself if as would probably be\\nthe case she consented to this increase of establishment\\nmarianne was shortly subdued and she promised not to\\ntempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning\\nthe offer and to tell willoughby when she saw him next\\nthat it must be declined\\n\\nshe was faithful to her word and when willoughby\\ncalled at the cottage the same day elinor heard her\\nexpress her disappointment to him in a low voice on\\nbeing obliged to forego the acceptance of his present\\nthe reasons for this alteration were at the same time related\\nand they were such as to make further entreaty on his\\nside impossible  his concern however was very apparent\\nand after expressing it with earnestness he added\\nin the same low voicebut marianne the horse is\\nstill yours though you cannot use it now  i shall keep\\nit only till you can claim it  when you leave barton\\nto form your own establishment in a more lasting home\\nqueen mab shall receive you\\n\\nthis was all overheard by miss dashwood and in the\\nwhole of the sentence in his manner of pronouncing it\\nand in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone\\nshe instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning\\nso direct as marked a perfect agreement between them\\nfrom that moment she doubted not of their being engaged\\nto each other and the belief of it created no other surprise\\nthan that she or any of their friends should be left\\nby tempers so frank to discover it by accident\\n\\nmargaret related something to her the next day\\nwhich placed this matter in a still clearer light\\nwilloughby had spent the preceding evening with them\\nand margaret by being left some time in the parlour\\nwith only him and marianne had had opportunity\\nfor observations which with a most important face\\nshe communicated to her eldest sister when they were\\nnext by themselves\\n\\noh elinor she cried i have such a secret to\\ntell you about marianne  i am sure she will be married\\nto mr willoughby very soon\\n\\nyou have said so replied elinor almost every\\nday since they first met on highchurch down and they\\nhad not known each other a week i believe before you\\nwere certain that marianne wore his picture round her neck\\nbut it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle\\n\\nbut indeed this is quite another thing  i am sure\\nthey will be married very soon for he has got a lock\\nof her hair\\n\\ntake care margaret  it may be only the hair\\nof some great uncle of his\\n\\nbut indeed elinor it is mariannes i am almost\\nsure it is for i saw him cut it off  last night\\nafter tea when you and mama went out of the room\\nthey were whispering and talking together as fast as\\ncould be and he seemed to be begging something of her\\nand presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long\\nlock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back\\nand he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper\\nand put it into his pocketbook\\n\\nfor such particulars stated on such authority\\nelinor could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed\\nto it for the circumstance was in perfect unison with\\nwhat she had heard and seen herself\\n\\nmargarets sagacity was not always displayed in a\\nway so satisfactory to her sister  when mrs jennings\\nattacked her one evening at the park to give the name\\nof the young man who was elinors particular favourite\\nwhich had been long a matter of great curiosity to her\\nmargaret answered by looking at her sister and saying\\ni must not tell may i elinor\\n\\nthis of course made every body laugh and elinor\\ntried to laugh too  but the effort was painful\\nshe was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person\\nwhose name she could not bear with composure to become\\na standing joke with mrs jennings\\n\\nmarianne felt for her most sincerely but she did\\nmore harm than good to the cause by turning very red\\nand saying in an angry manner to margaret\\n\\nremember that whatever your conjectures may be\\nyou have no right to repeat them\\n\\ni never had any conjectures about it replied margaret\\nit was you who told me of it yourself\\n\\nthis increased the mirth of the company and margaret\\nwas eagerly pressed to say something more\\n\\noh pray miss margaret let us know all about it\\nsaid mrs jennings  what is the gentlemans name\\n\\ni must not tell maam but i know very well what it is\\nand i know where he is too\\n\\nyes yes we can guess where he is at his own house\\nat norland to be sure  he is the curate of the parish\\ni dare say\\n\\nno that he is not  he is of no profession at all\\n\\nmargaret said marianne with great warmth\\nyou know that all this is an invention of your own\\nand that there is no such person in existence\\n\\nwell then he is lately dead marianne for i\\nam sure there was such a man once and his name begins\\nwith an f\\n\\nmost grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton\\nfor observing at this moment that it rained very hard\\nthough she believed the interruption to proceed less from\\nany attention to her than from her ladyships great dislike\\nof all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted\\nher husband and mother  the idea however started by her\\nwas immediately pursued by colonel brandon who was\\non every occasion mindful of the feelings of others\\nand much was said on the subject of rain by both of them\\nwilloughby opened the pianoforte and asked marianne\\nto sit down to it and thus amidst the various endeavours\\nof different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground\\nbut not so easily did elinor recover from the alarm into\\nwhich it had thrown her\\n\\na party was formed this evening for going on the\\nfollowing day to see a very fine place about twelve miles\\nfrom barton belonging to a brotherinlaw of colonel brandon\\nwithout whose interest it could not be seen as the proprietor\\nwho was then abroad had left strict orders on that head\\nthe grounds were declared to be highly beautiful\\nand sir john who was particularly warm in their praise\\nmight be allowed to be a tolerable judge for he had\\nformed parties to visit them at least twice every summer\\nfor the last ten years  they contained a noble piece\\nof water a sail on which was to a form a great part of\\nthe mornings amusement cold provisions were to be taken\\nopen carriages only to be employed and every thing\\nconducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure\\n\\nto some few of the company it appeared rather\\na bold undertaking considering the time of year\\nand that it had rained every day for the last fortnight\\nand mrs dashwood who had already a cold was persuaded\\nby elinor to stay at home\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 13\\n\\n\\ntheir intended excursion to whitwell turned out\\nvery different from what elinor had expected  she was\\nprepared to be wet through fatigued and frightened\\nbut the event was still more unfortunate for they did\\nnot go at all\\n\\nby ten oclock the whole party was assembled at\\nthe park where they were to breakfast  the morning\\nwas rather favourable though it had rained all night\\nas the clouds were then dispersing across the sky\\nand the sun frequently appeared  they were all in high\\nspirits and good humour eager to be happy and determined\\nto submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships\\nrather than be otherwise\\n\\nwhile they were at breakfast the letters were brought in\\namong the rest there was one for colonel brandonhe\\ntook it looked at the direction changed colour\\nand immediately left the room\\n\\nwhat is the matter with brandon said sir john\\n\\nnobody could tell\\n\\ni hope he has had no bad news said lady middleton\\nit must be something extraordinary that could make colonel\\nbrandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly\\n\\nin about five minutes he returned\\n\\nno bad news colonel i hope said mrs jennings\\nas soon as he entered the room\\n\\nnone at all maam i thank you\\n\\nwas it from avignon  i hope it is not to say\\nthat your sister is worse\\n\\nno maam it came from town and is merely\\na letter of business\\n\\nbut how came the hand to discompose you so much\\nif it was only a letter of business  come come\\nthis wont do colonel so let us hear the truth of it\\n\\nmy dear madam said lady middleton recollect what\\nyou are saying\\n\\nperhaps it is to tell you that your cousin fanny\\nis married said mrs jennings without attending\\nto her daughters reproof\\n\\nno indeed it is not\\n\\nwell then i know who it is from colonel  and i\\nhope she is well\\n\\nwhom do you mean maam said he colouring a little\\n\\noh you know who i mean\\n\\ni am particularly sorry maam said he\\naddressing lady middleton that i should receive this\\nletter today for it is on business which requires\\nmy immediate attendance in town\\n\\nin town cried mrs jennings  what can you\\nhave to do in town at this time of year\\n\\nmy own loss is great be continued in being obliged\\nto leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned\\nas i fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance\\nat whitwell\\n\\nwhat a blow upon them all was this\\n\\nbut if you write a note to the housekeeper mr brandon\\nsaid marianne eagerly will it not be sufficient\\n\\nhe shook his head\\n\\nwe must go said sir johnit shall not be put\\noff when we are so near it  you cannot go to town till\\ntomorrow brandon that is all\\n\\ni wish it could be so easily settled  but it\\nis not in my power to delay my journey for one day\\n\\nif you would but let us know what your business is\\nsaid mrs jennings we might see whether it could be put\\noff or not\\n\\nyou would not be six hours later said willoughby\\nif you were to defer your journey till our return\\n\\ni cannot afford to lose one hour\\n\\nelinor then heard willoughby say in a low voice to marianne\\nthere are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure\\nbrandon is one of them  he was afraid of catching cold\\ni dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it\\ni would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing\\n\\ni have no doubt of it replied marianne\\n\\nthere is no persuading you to change your mind\\nbrandon i know of old said sir john when once you\\nare determined on anything  but however i hope you\\nwill think better of it  consider here are the two miss\\ncareys come over from newton the three miss dashwoods\\nwalked up from the cottage and mr willoughby got up\\ntwo hours before his usual time on purpose to go to whitwell\\n\\ncolonel brandon again repeated his sorrow at being\\nthe cause of disappointing the party but at the same\\ntime declared it to be unavoidable\\n\\nwell then when will you come back again\\n\\ni hope we shall see you at barton added her ladyship\\nas soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must\\nput off the party to whitwell till you return\\n\\nyou are very obliging  but it is so uncertain\\nwhen i may have it in my power to return that i dare\\nnot engage for it at all\\n\\noh he must and shall come back cried sir john\\nif he is not here by the end of the week i shall go\\nafter him\\n\\nay so do sir john cried mrs jennings and then\\nperhaps you may find out what his business is\\n\\ni do not want to pry into other mens concerns\\ni suppose it is something he is ashamed of\\n\\ncolonel brandons horses were announced\\n\\nyou do not go to town on horseback do you\\nadded sir john\\n\\nno only to honiton  i shall then go post\\n\\nwell as you are resolved to go i wish you\\na good journey  but you had better change your mind\\n\\ni assure you it is not in my power\\n\\nhe then took leave of the whole party\\n\\nis there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters\\nin town this winter miss dashwood\\n\\ni am afraid none at all\\n\\nthen i must bid you farewell for a longer time\\nthan i should wish to do\\n\\nto marianne he merely bowed and said nothing\\n\\ncome colonel said mrs jennings before you go\\ndo let us know what you are going about\\n\\nhe wished her a good morning and attended by sir john\\nleft the room\\n\\nthe complaints and lamentations which politeness\\nhad hitherto restrained now burst forth universally\\nand they all agreed again and again how provoking it was\\nto be so disappointed\\n\\ni can guess what his business is however\\nsaid mrs jennings exultingly\\n\\ncan you maam said almost every body\\n\\nyes it is about miss williams i am sure\\n\\nand who is miss williams asked marianne\\n\\nwhat do not you know who miss williams is i am\\nsure you must have heard of her before  she is a relation\\nof the colonels my dear a very near relation  we will\\nnot say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies\\nthen lowering her voice a little she said to elinor\\nshe is his natural daughter\\n\\nindeed\\n\\noh yes and as like him as she can stare\\ni dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune\\n\\nwhen sir john returned he joined most heartily\\nin the general regret on so unfortunate an event\\nconcluding however by observing that as they were\\nall got together they must do something by way of\\nbeing happy and after some consultation it was agreed\\nthat although happiness could only be enjoyed at whitwell\\nthey might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving\\nabout the country  the carriages were then ordered\\nwilloughbys was first and marianne never looked\\nhappier than when she got into it  he drove through\\nthe park very fast and they were soon out of sight\\nand nothing more of them was seen till their return\\nwhich did not happen till after the return of all the rest\\nthey both seemed delighted with their drive but said\\nonly in general terms that they had kept in the lanes\\nwhile the others went on the downs\\n\\nit was settled that there should be a dance in the evening\\nand that every body should be extremely merry all day long\\nsome more of the careys came to dinner and they had the\\npleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir\\njohn observed with great contentment  willoughby took\\nhis usual place between the two elder miss dashwoods\\nmrs jennings sat on elinors right hand and they had not\\nbeen long seated before she leant behind her and willoughby\\nand said to marianne loud enough for them both to hear\\ni have found you out in spite of all your tricks\\ni know where you spent the morning\\n\\nmarianne coloured and replied very hastily\\nwhere pray\\n\\ndid not you know said willoughby that we had\\nbeen out in my curricle\\n\\nyes yes mr impudence i know that very well\\nand i was determined to find out where you had been to\\ni hope you like your house miss marianne  it is a very\\nlarge one i know and when i come to see you i hope you\\nwill have newfurnished it for it wanted it very much\\nwhen i was there six years ago\\n\\nmarianne turned away in great confusion\\nmrs jennings laughed heartily and elinor found that in her\\nresolution to know where they had been she had actually\\nmade her own woman enquire of mr willoughbys groom\\nand that she had by that method been informed that they\\nhad gone to allenham and spent a considerable time there\\nin walking about the garden and going all over the house\\n\\nelinor could hardly believe this to be true\\nas it seemed very unlikely that willoughby should propose\\nor marianne consent to enter the house while mrs smith was\\nin it with whom marianne had not the smallest acquaintance\\n\\nas soon as they left the diningroom elinor enquired\\nof her about it and great was her surprise when she\\nfound that every circumstance related by mrs jennings\\nwas perfectly true  marianne was quite angry with her\\nfor doubting it\\n\\nwhy should you imagine elinor that we did not\\ngo there or that we did not see the house  is not it\\nwhat you have often wished to do yourself\\n\\nyes marianne but i would not go while mrs smith\\nwas there and with no other companion than mr willoughby\\n\\nmr willoughby however is the only person who can\\nhave a right to shew that house and as he went in an open\\ncarriage it was impossible to have any other companion\\ni never spent a pleasanter morning in my life\\n\\ni am afraid replied elinor that the pleasantness\\nof an employment does not always evince its propriety\\n\\non the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof\\nof it elinor for if there had been any real impropriety\\nin what i did i should have been sensible of it at\\nthe time for we always know when we are acting wrong\\nand with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure\\n\\nbut my dear marianne as it has already exposed you\\nto some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin\\nto doubt the discretion of your own conduct\\n\\nif the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are\\nto be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all\\noffending every moment of our lives  i value not her\\ncensure any more than i should do her commendation\\ni am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking\\nover mrs smiths grounds or in seeing her house\\nthey will one day be mr willoughbys and\\n\\nif they were one day to be your own marianne\\nyou would not be justified in what you have done\\n\\nshe blushed at this hint but it was even visibly\\ngratifying to her and after a ten minutes interval of\\nearnest thought she came to her sister again and said\\nwith great good humour perhaps elinor it was rather\\nilljudged in me to go to allenham but mr willoughby wanted\\nparticularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house\\ni assure youthere is one remarkably pretty sitting room\\nup stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use\\nand with modern furniture it would be delightful\\nit is a corner room and has windows on two sides\\non one side you look across the bowlinggreen behind\\nthe house to a beautiful hanging wood and on the other you\\nhave a view of the church and village and beyond them\\nof those fine bold hills that we have so often admired\\ni did not see it to advantage for nothing could be\\nmore forlorn than the furniturebut if it were newly\\nfitted upa couple of hundred pounds willoughby says\\nwould make it one of the pleasantest summerrooms\\nin england\\n\\ncould elinor have listened to her without interruption\\nfrom the others she would have described every room\\nin the house with equal delight\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 14\\n\\n\\nthe sudden termination of colonel brandons visit\\nat the park with his steadiness in concealing its cause\\nfilled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs jennings\\nfor two or three days she was a great wonderer as every\\none must be who takes a very lively interest in all the\\ncomings and goings of all their acquaintance  she wondered\\nwith little intermission what could be the reason of it\\nwas sure there must be some bad news and thought over\\nevery kind of distress that could have befallen him\\nwith a fixed determination that he should not escape\\nthem all\\n\\nsomething very melancholy must be the matter\\ni am sure said she  i could see it in his face\\npoor man  i am afraid his circumstances may be bad\\nthe estate at delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand\\na year and his brother left everything sadly involved\\ni do think he must have been sent for about money matters\\nfor what else can it be  i wonder whether it is so\\ni would give anything to know the truth of it  perhaps it\\nis about miss williams and by the bye i dare say it is\\nbecause he looked so conscious when i mentioned her\\nmay be she is ill in town nothing in the world more likely\\nfor i have a notion she is always rather sickly\\ni would lay any wager it is about miss williams\\nit is not so very likely he should be distressed in\\nhis circumstances now for he is a very prudent man\\nand to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time\\ni wonder what it can be  may be his sister is worse\\nat avignon and has sent for him over  his setting off\\nin such a hurry seems very like it  well i wish him out\\nof all his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into\\nthe bargain\\n\\nso wondered so talked mrs jennings  her opinion\\nvarying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming\\nequally probable as they arose  elinor though she felt\\nreally interested in the welfare of colonel brandon\\ncould not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly\\naway which mrs jennings was desirous of her feeling\\nfor besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion\\njustify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation\\nher wonder was otherwise disposed of  it was engrossed\\nby the extraordinary silence of her sister and willoughby\\non the subject which they must know to be peculiarly\\ninteresting to them all  as this silence continued\\nevery day made it appear more strange and more incompatible\\nwith the disposition of both  why they should not openly\\nacknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant\\nbehaviour to each other declared to have taken place\\nelinor could not imagine\\n\\nshe could easily conceive that marriage might not\\nbe immediately in their power for though willoughby\\nwas independent there was no reason to believe him rich\\nhis estate had been rated by sir john at about six or seven\\nhundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that income\\ncould hardly be equal and he had himself often complained\\nof his poverty  but for this strange kind of secrecy\\nmaintained by them relative to their engagement which\\nin fact concealed nothing at all she could not account\\nand it was so wholly contradictory to their general\\nopinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered\\nher mind of their being really engaged and this doubt\\nwas enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne\\n\\nnothing could be more expressive of attachment\\nto them all than willoughbys behaviour  to marianne\\nit had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lovers\\nheart could give and to the rest of the family it was the\\naffectionate attention of a son and a brother  the cottage\\nseemed to be considered and loved by him as his home\\nmany more of his hours were spent there than at allenham\\nand if no general engagement collected them at the park\\nthe exercise which called him out in the morning was\\nalmost certain of ending there where the rest of the day\\nwas spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his\\nfavourite pointer at her feet\\n\\none evening in particular about a week after\\ncolonel brandon left the country his heart seemed\\nmore than usually open to every feeling of attachment\\nto the objects around him and on mrs dashwoods\\nhappening to mention her design of improving the cottage\\nin the spring he warmly opposed every alteration\\nof a place which affection had established as perfect with him\\n\\nwhat he exclaimedimprove this dear cottage\\nno that i will never consent to  not a stone must\\nbe added to its walls not an inch to its size\\nif my feelings are regarded\\n\\ndo not be alarmed said miss dashwood\\nnothing of the kind will be done for my mother\\nwill never have money enough to attempt it\\n\\ni am heartily glad of it he cried  may she\\nalways be poor if she can employ her riches no better\\n\\nthank you willoughby  but you may be assured that i\\nwould not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment\\nof yours or of any one whom i loved for all the improvements\\nin the world  depend upon it that whatever unemployed\\nsum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring\\ni would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose\\nof it in a manner so painful to you  but are you really\\nso attached to this place as to see no defect in it\\n\\ni am said he  to me it is faultless  nay more\\ni consider it as the only form of building in which happiness\\nis attainable and were i rich enough i would instantly pull\\ncombe down and build it up again in the exact plan of this\\ncottage\\n\\nwith dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes\\ni suppose said elinor\\n\\nyes cried he in the same eager tone with all\\nand every thing belonging to itin no one convenience\\nor inconvenience about it should the least variation\\nbe perceptible  then and then only under such a roof i\\nmight perhaps be as happy at combe as i have been at barton\\n\\ni flatter myself replied elinor that even under\\nthe disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase\\nyou will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you\\nnow do this\\n\\nthere certainly are circumstances said willoughby\\nwhich might greatly endear it to me but this place will\\nalways have one claim of my affection which no other can\\npossibly share\\n\\nmrs dashwood looked with pleasure at marianne\\nwhose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on willoughby\\nas plainly denoted how well she understood him\\n\\nhow often did i wish added he when i was at\\nallenham this time twelvemonth that barton cottage were\\ninhabited  i never passed within view of it without admiring\\nits situation and grieving that no one should live in it\\nhow little did i then think that the very first news\\ni should hear from mrs smith when i next came into\\nthe country would be that barton cottage was taken and i\\nfelt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event\\nwhich nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i\\nshould experience from it can account for  must it not have\\nbeen so marianne speaking to her in a lowered voice\\nthen continuing his former tone he said and yet this\\nhouse you would spoil mrs dashwood  you would rob it\\nof its simplicity by imaginary improvement and this dear\\nparlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which\\nso many happy hours have been since spent by us together\\nyou would degrade to the condition of a common entrance\\nand every body would be eager to pass through the room\\nwhich has hitherto contained within itself more real\\naccommodation and comfort than any other apartment of\\nthe handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford\\n\\nmrs dashwood again assured him that no alteration\\nof the kind should be attempted\\n\\nyou are a good woman he warmly replied\\nyour promise makes me easy  extend it a little farther\\nand it will make me happy  tell me that not only your\\nhouse will remain the same but that i shall ever find\\nyou and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you\\nwill always consider me with the kindness which has made\\neverything belonging to you so dear to me\\n\\nthe promise was readily given and willoughbys\\nbehaviour during the whole of the evening declared\\nat once his affection and happiness\\n\\nshall we see you tomorrow to dinner said mrs dashwood\\nwhen he was leaving them  i do not ask you to come in\\nthe morning for we must walk to the park to call on lady\\nmiddleton\\n\\nhe engaged to be with them by four oclock\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 15\\n\\n\\nmrs dashwoods visit to lady middleton took place\\nthe next day and two of her daughters went with her\\nbut marianne excused herself from being of the party\\nunder some trifling pretext of employment and her mother\\nwho concluded that a promise had been made by willoughby\\nthe night before of calling on her while they were absent\\nwas perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home\\n\\non their return from the park they found willoughbys\\ncurricle and servant in waiting at the cottage\\nand mrs dashwood was convinced that her conjecture\\nhad been just  so far it was all as she had foreseen\\nbut on entering the house she beheld what no foresight\\nhad taught her to expect  they were no sooner in the\\npassage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour\\napparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief\\nat her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs\\nsurprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room\\nshe had just quitted where they found only willoughby\\nwho was leaning against the mantelpiece with his back\\ntowards them  he turned round on their coming in\\nand his countenance shewed that he strongly partook\\nof the emotion which overpowered marianne\\n\\nis anything the matter with her cried mrs dashwood\\nas she enteredis she ill\\n\\ni hope not he replied trying to look cheerful\\nand with a forced smile presently added it is i who may\\nrather expect to be illfor i am now suffering under a\\nvery heavy disappointment\\n\\ndisappointment\\n\\nyes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you\\nmrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege\\nof riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on\\nbusiness to london  i have just received my dispatches\\nand taken my farewell of allenham and by way of exhilaration\\ni am now come to take my farewell of you\\n\\nto londonand are you going this morning\\n\\nalmost this moment\\n\\nthis is very unfortunate  but mrs smith must\\nbe obligedand her business will not detain you from\\nus long i hope\\n\\nhe coloured as he replied you are very kind but i\\nhave no idea of returning into devonshire immediately\\nmy visits to mrs smith are never repeated within\\nthe twelvemonth\\n\\nand is mrs smith your only friend  is allenham the only\\nhouse in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome\\nfor shame willoughby can you wait for an invitation here\\n\\nhis colour increased and with his eyes fixed\\non the ground he only replied you are too good\\n\\nmrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise\\nelinor felt equal amazement  for a few moments every one\\nwas silent  mrs dashwood first spoke\\n\\ni have only to add my dear willoughby that at\\nbarton cottage you will always be welcome for i will not\\npress you to return here immediately because you only\\ncan judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith\\nand on this head i shall be no more disposed to question\\nyour judgment than to doubt your inclination\\n\\nmy engagements at present replied willoughby\\nconfusedly are of such a naturethati dare not flatter\\nmyself\\n\\nhe stopt  mrs dashwood was too much astonished\\nto speak and another pause succeeded  this was broken\\nby willoughby who said with a faint smile it is folly\\nto linger in this manner  i will not torment myself\\nany longer by remaining among friends whose society\\nit is impossible for me now to enjoy\\n\\nhe then hastily took leave of them all and left\\nthe room  they saw him step into his carriage\\nand in a minute it was out of sight\\n\\nmrs dashwood felt too much for speech and instantly\\nquitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern\\nand alarm which this sudden departure occasioned\\n\\nelinors uneasiness was at least equal to her mothers\\nshe thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust\\nwilloughbys behaviour in taking leave of them his\\nembarrassment\\nand affectation of cheerfulness and above all his\\nunwillingness\\nto accept her mothers invitation a backwardness so unlike a\\nlover\\nso unlike himself greatly disturbed her  one moment she feared\\nthat no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the\\nnext that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him\\nand\\nher sisterthe distress in which marianne had quitted the room\\nwas such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for\\nthough when she considered what mariannes love for him was\\na quarrel seemed almost impossible\\n\\nbut whatever might be the particulars of their separation\\nher sisters affliction was indubitable and she thought\\nwith the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow\\nwhich marianne was in all probability not merely giving\\nway to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a duty\\n\\nin about half an hour her mother returned and though\\nher eyes were red her countenance was not uncheerful\\n\\nour dear willoughby is now some miles from barton elinor\\nsaid she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart\\ndoes he travel\\n\\nit is all very strange  so suddenly to be gone it\\nseems but the work of a moment  and last night he was\\nwith us so happy so cheerful so affectionate  and now\\nafter only ten minutes noticegone too without intending\\nto returnsomething more than what be owned to us must\\nhave happened  he did not speak he did not behave\\nlike himself  you must have seen the difference as well as i\\nwhat can it be  can they have quarrelled  why else should he\\nhave shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here\\n\\nit was not inclination that he wanted elinor i could\\nplainly see that  he had not the power of accepting it\\ni have thought it all over i assure you and i can\\nperfectly account for every thing that at first seemed\\nstrange to me as well as to you\\n\\ncan you indeed\\n\\nyes i have explained it to myself in the most\\nsatisfactory waybut you elinor who love to doubt\\nwhere you canit will not satisfy you i know but you\\nshall not talk me out of my trust in it  i am persuaded\\nthat mrs smith suspects his regard for marianne\\ndisapproves of it perhaps because she has other views\\nfor him and on that account is eager to get him away\\nand that the business which she sends him off to transact\\nis invented as an excuse to dismiss him  this is what i\\nbelieve to have happened  he is moreover aware that she\\ndoes disapprove the connection he dares not therefore\\nat present confess to her his engagement with marianne\\nand he feels himself obliged from his dependent situation\\nto give into her schemes and absent himself from\\ndevonshire for a while  you will tell me i know\\nthat this may or may not have happened but i will listen\\nto no cavil unless you can point out any other method\\nof understanding the affair as satisfactory at this\\nand now elinor what have you to say\\n\\nnothing for you have anticipated my answer\\n\\nthen you would have told me that it might or might not\\nhave happened  oh elinor how incomprehensible are your\\nfeelings  you had rather take evil upon credit than good\\nyou had rather look out for misery for marianne and guilt\\nfor poor willoughby than an apology for the latter\\nyou are resolved to think him blameable because he took\\nleave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour\\nhas shewn  and is no allowance to be made for inadvertence\\nor for spirits depressed by recent disappointment  are\\nno probabilities to be accepted merely because they\\nare not certainties  is nothing due to the man whom we\\nhave all such reason to love and no reason in the world\\nto think ill of  to the possibility of motives unanswerable\\nin themselves though unavoidably secret for a while  and\\nafter all what is it you suspect him of\\n\\ni can hardly tell myself  but suspicion of\\nsomething unpleasant is the inevitable consequence\\nof such an alteration as we just witnessed in him\\nthere is great truth however in what you have now urged\\nof the allowances which ought to be made for him and it\\nis my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body\\nwilloughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient\\nreasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has\\nbut it would have been more like willoughby to acknowledge\\nthem at once  secrecy may be advisable but still i\\ncannot help wondering at its being practiced by him\\n\\ndo not blame him however for departing from\\nhis character where the deviation is necessary\\nbut you really do admit the justice of what i have said\\nin his defencei am happyand he is acquitted\\n\\nnot entirely  it may be proper to conceal their\\nengagement if they are engaged from mrs smith\\nand if that is the case it must be highly expedient\\nfor willoughby to be but little in devonshire at present\\nbut this is no excuse for their concealing it from us\\n\\nconcealing it from us my dear child do you accuse\\nwilloughby and marianne of concealment this is strange\\nindeed when your eyes have been reproaching them every day\\nfor incautiousness\\n\\ni want no proof of their affection said elinor\\nbut of their engagement i do\\n\\ni am perfectly satisfied of both\\n\\nyet not a syllable has been said to you on the\\nsubject by either of them\\n\\ni have not wanted syllables where actions have\\nspoken so plainly  has not his behaviour to marianne\\nand to all of us for at least the last fortnight\\ndeclared that he loved and considered her as his future wife\\nand that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest\\nrelation  have we not perfectly understood each other\\nhas not my consent been daily asked by his looks his manner\\nhis attentive and affectionate respect  my elinor\\nis it possible to doubt their engagement  how could\\nsuch a thought occur to you  how is it to be supposed\\nthat willoughby persuaded as he must be of your\\nsisters love should leave her and leave her perhaps\\nfor months without telling her of his affectionthat\\nthey should part without a mutual exchange of confidence\\n\\ni confess replied elinor that every circumstance\\nexcept one is in favour of their engagement\\nbut that one is the total silence of both on the subject\\nand with me it almost outweighs every other\\n\\nhow strange this is  you must think wretchedly indeed\\nof willoughby if after all that has openly passed between them\\nyou can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together\\nhas he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister\\nall this time  do you suppose him really indifferent to her\\n\\nno i cannot think that  he must and does love her\\ni am sure\\n\\nbut with a strange kind of tenderness if he can\\nleave her with such indifference such carelessness\\nof the future as you attribute to him\\n\\nyou must remember my dear mother that i have never\\nconsidered this matter as certain  i have had my doubts\\ni confess but they are fainter than they were and they\\nmay soon be entirely done away  if we find they correspond\\nevery fear of mine will be removed\\n\\na mighty concession indeed  if you were to see\\nthem at the altar you would suppose they were going to\\nbe married  ungracious girl  but i require no such proof\\nnothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt\\nno secrecy has been attempted all has been uniformly open\\nand unreserved  you cannot doubt your sisters wishes\\nit must be willoughby therefore whom you suspect  but why\\nis he not a man of honour and feeling has there been any\\ninconsistency on his side to create alarm can he be deceitful\\n\\ni hope not i believe not cried elinor\\ni love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his\\nintegrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me\\nit has been involuntary and i will not encourage it\\ni was startled i confess by the alteration in his\\nmanners this morninghe did not speak like himself\\nand did not return your kindness with any cordiality\\nbut all this may be explained by such a situation of his\\naffairs as you have supposed  he had just parted from\\nmy sister had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction\\nand if he felt obliged from a fear of offending mrs smith\\nto resist the temptation of returning here soon and yet\\naware that by declining your invitation by saying\\nthat he was going away for some time he should seem\\nto act an ungenerous a suspicious part by our family\\nbe might well be embarrassed and disturbed  in such a case\\na plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been\\nmore to his honour i think as well as more consistent\\nwith his general characterbut i will not raise objections\\nagainst any ones conduct on so illiberal a foundation\\nas a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from\\nwhat i may think right and consistent\\n\\nyou speak very properly  willoughby certainly does\\nnot deserve to be suspected  though we have not known\\nhim long he is no stranger in this part of the world\\nand who has ever spoken to his disadvantage  had he been\\nin a situation to act independently and marry immediately\\nit might have been odd that he should leave us without\\nacknowledging everything to me at once but this is not the case\\nit is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun\\nfor their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance\\nand even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now\\nbe very advisable\\n\\nthey were interrupted by the entrance of margaret\\nand elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations\\nof her mother to acknowledge the probability of many\\nand hope for the justice of all\\n\\nthey saw nothing of marianne till dinner time\\nwhen she entered the room and took her place at the table\\nwithout saying a word  her eyes were red and swollen\\nand it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained\\nwith difficulty  she avoided the looks of them all\\ncould neither eat nor speak and after some time on her\\nmothers silently pressing her hand with tender compassion\\nher small degree of fortitude was quite overcome she burst\\ninto tears and left the room\\n\\nthis violent oppression of spirits continued the\\nwhole evening  she was without any power because she\\nwas without any desire of command over herself\\nthe slightest mention of anything relative to willoughby\\noverpowered her in an instant and though her family\\nwere most anxiously attentive to her comfort it was\\nimpossible for them if they spoke at all to keep clear\\nof every subject which her feelings connected with him\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 16\\n\\n\\nmarianne would have thought herself very inexcusable\\nhad she been able to sleep at all the first night\\nafter parting from willoughby  she would have been\\nashamed to look her family in the face the next morning\\nhad she not risen from her bed in more need of repose\\nthan when she lay down in it  but the feelings which\\nmade such composure a disgrace left her in no danger\\nof incurring it  she was awake the whole night and she\\nwept the greatest part of it  she got up with a headache\\nwas unable to talk and unwilling to take any nourishment\\ngiving pain every moment to her mother and sisters\\nand forbidding all attempt at consolation from either\\nher sensibility was potent enough\\n\\nwhen breakfast was over she walked out by herself\\nand wandered about the village of allenham indulging the\\nrecollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present\\nreverse for the chief of the morning\\n\\nthe evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling\\nshe played over every favourite song that she had been used\\nto play to willoughby every air in which their voices\\nhad been oftenest joined and sat at the instrument gazing\\non every line of music that he had written out for her\\ntill her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness\\ncould be gained and this nourishment of grief was every\\nday applied  she spent whole hours at the pianoforte\\nalternately singing and crying her voice often totally\\nsuspended by her tears  in books too as well as in music\\nshe courted the misery which a contrast between the past\\nand present was certain of giving  she read nothing\\nbut what they had been used to read together\\n\\nsuch violence of affliction indeed could not be supported\\nfor ever it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy\\nbut these employments to which she daily recurred\\nher solitary walks and silent meditations still produced\\noccasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever\\n\\nno letter from willoughby came and none seemed expected\\nby marianne  her mother was surprised and elinor again\\nbecame uneasy  but mrs dashwood could find explanations\\nwhenever she wanted them which at least satisfied herself\\n\\nremember elinor said she how very often sir john\\nfetches our letters himself from the post and carries them\\nto it  we have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary\\nand we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if\\ntheir correspondence were to pass through sir johns hands\\n\\nelinor could not deny the truth of this and she tried\\nto find in it a motive sufficient for their silence\\nbut there was one method so direct so simple and in\\nher opinion so eligible of knowing the real state\\nof the affair and of instantly removing all mystery\\nthat she could not help suggesting it to her mother\\n\\nwhy do you not ask marianne at once said she\\nwhether she is or she is not engaged to willoughby  from you\\nher mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question\\ncould not give offence  it would be the natural result\\nof your affection for her  she used to be all unreserve\\nand to you more especially\\n\\ni would not ask such a question for the world\\nsupposing it possible that they are not engaged\\nwhat distress would not such an enquiry inflict  at any\\nrate it would be most ungenerous  i should never deserve\\nher confidence again after forcing from her a confession\\nof what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one\\ni know mariannes heart i know that she dearly loves me\\nand that i shall not be the last to whom the affair is made\\nknown\\nwhen circumstances make the revealment of it eligible\\ni would not attempt to force the confidence of any one\\nof a child much less because a sense of duty would prevent\\nthe denial which her wishes might direct\\n\\nelinor thought this generosity overstrained\\nconsidering her sisters youth and urged the matter farther\\nbut in vain common sense common care common prudence\\nwere all sunk in mrs dashwoods romantic delicacy\\n\\nit was several days before willoughbys name\\nwas mentioned before marianne by any of her family\\nsir john and mrs jennings indeed were not so nice\\ntheir witticisms added pain to many a painful hour\\nbut one evening mrs dashwood accidentally taking up a\\nvolume of shakespeare exclaimed\\n\\nwe have never finished hamlet marianne our dear\\nwilloughby went away before we could get through it\\nwe will put it by that when he comes againbut it may\\nbe months perhaps before that happens\\n\\nmonths cried marianne with strong surprise\\nnonor many weeks\\n\\nmrs dashwood was sorry for what she had said\\nbut it gave elinor pleasure as it produced a reply\\nfrom marianne so expressive of confidence in willoughby\\nand knowledge of his intentions\\n\\none morning about a week after his leaving the country\\nmarianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their\\nusual walk instead of wandering away by herself\\nhitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in\\nher rambles  if her sisters intended to walk on the downs\\nshe directly stole away towards the lanes if they talked\\nof the valley she was as speedy in climbing the hills\\nand could never be found when the others set off\\nbut at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor\\nwho greatly disapproved such continual seclusion  they walked\\nalong the road through the valley and chiefly in silence\\nfor mariannes mind could not be controlled and elinor\\nsatisfied with gaining one point would not then attempt more\\nbeyond the entrance of the valley where the country\\nthough still rich was less wild and more open a long\\nstretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming\\nto barton lay before them and on reaching that point\\nthey stopped to look around them and examine a prospect\\nwhich formed the distance of their view from the cottage\\nfrom a spot which they had never happened to reach in any\\nof their walks before\\n\\namongst the objects in the scene they soon discovered\\nan animated one it was a man on horseback riding towards them\\nin a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman\\nand in a moment afterwards marianne rapturously exclaimed\\n\\nit is he it is indeedi know it isand was\\nhastening to meet him when elinor cried out\\n\\nindeed marianne i think you are mistaken  it is\\nnot willoughby  the person is not tall enough for him\\nand has not his air\\n\\nhe has he has cried marianne i am sure he has\\nhis air his coat his horse  i knew how soon he would come\\n\\nshe walked eagerly on as she spoke and elinor\\nto screen marianne from particularity as she felt almost\\ncertain of its not being willoughby quickened her\\npace and kept up with her  they were soon within\\nthirty yards of the gentleman  marianne looked again\\nher heart sunk within her and abruptly turning round\\nshe was hurrying back when the voices of both her sisters\\nwere raised to detain her a third almost as well known\\nas willoughbys joined them in begging her to stop\\nand she turned round with surprise to see and welcome\\nedward ferrars\\n\\nhe was the only person in the world who could\\nat that moment be forgiven for not being willoughby\\nthe only one who could have gained a smile from her\\nbut she dispersed her tears to smile on him and in her\\nsisters happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment\\n\\nhe dismounted and giving his horse to his servant\\nwalked back with them to barton whither he was purposely\\ncoming to visit them\\n\\nhe was welcomed by them all with great cordiality\\nbut especially by marianne who showed more warmth of\\nregard in her reception of him than even elinor herself\\nto marianne indeed the meeting between edward and her sister\\nwas but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she\\nhad often observed at norland in their mutual behaviour\\non edwards side more particularly there was a deficiency\\nof all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion\\nhe was confused seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure\\nin seeing them looked neither rapturous nor gay\\nsaid little but what was forced from him by questions\\nand distinguished elinor by no mark of affection\\nmarianne saw and listened with increasing surprise\\nshe began almost to feel a dislike of edward and it ended\\nas every feeling must end with her by carrying back her\\nthoughts to willoughby whose manners formed a contrast\\nsufficiently striking to those of his brother elect\\n\\nafter a short silence which succeeded the first\\nsurprise and enquiries of meeting marianne asked\\nedward if he came directly from london  no he had\\nbeen in devonshire a fortnight\\n\\na fortnight she repeated surprised at his being\\nso long in the same county with elinor without seeing\\nher before\\n\\nhe looked rather distressed as he added that he\\nhad been staying with some friends near plymouth\\n\\nhave you been lately in sussex said elinor\\n\\ni was at norland about a month ago\\n\\nand how does dear dear norland look cried marianne\\n\\ndear dear norland said elinor probably looks\\nmuch as it always does at this time of the year\\nthe woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves\\n\\noh cried marianne with what transporting sensation\\nhave i formerly seen them fall  how have i delighted\\nas i walked to see them driven in showers about me\\nby the wind  what feelings have they the season the air\\naltogether inspired  now there is no one to regard them\\nthey are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off\\nand driven as much as possible from the sight\\n\\nit is not every one said elinor who has your\\npassion for dead leaves\\n\\nno my feelings are not often shared not often\\nunderstood  but sometimes they areas she said this\\nshe sunk into a reverie for a few momentsbut rousing\\nherself again now edward said she calling his attention\\nto the prospect here is barton valley  look up to it\\nand be tranquil if you can  look at those hills\\ndid you ever see their equals  to the left is barton park\\namongst those woods and plantations  you may see the end\\nof the house  and there beneath that farthest hill\\nwhich rises with such grandeur is our cottage\\n\\nit is a beautiful country he replied but these\\nbottoms must be dirty in winter\\n\\nhow can you think of dirt with such objects before you\\n\\nbecause replied he smiling among the rest of the\\nobjects before me i see a very dirty lane\\n\\nhow strange said marianne to herself as she walked on\\n\\nhave you an agreeable neighbourhood here  are the\\nmiddletons pleasant people\\n\\nno not all answered marianne we could not\\nbe more unfortunately situated\\n\\nmarianne cried her sister how can you say so how can\\nyou be so unjust  they are a very respectable family mr\\nferrars\\nand towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner  have you\\nforgot marianne how many pleasant days we have owed to them\\n\\nno said marianne in a low voice nor how many\\npainful moments\\n\\nelinor took no notice of this and directing\\nher attention to their visitor endeavoured to support\\nsomething like discourse with him by talking of their\\npresent residence its conveniences c extorting from him\\noccasional questions and remarks  his coldness and reserve\\nmortified her severely she was vexed and half angry\\nbut resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past\\nrather than the present she avoided every appearance\\nof resentment or displeasure and treated him as she\\nthought he ought to be treated from the family connection\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 17\\n\\n\\nmrs dashwood was surprised only for a moment at\\nseeing him for his coming to barton was in her opinion\\nof all things the most natural  her joy and expression\\nof regard long outlived her wonder  he received the kindest\\nwelcome from her and shyness coldness reserve could not\\nstand against such a reception  they had begun to fail him\\nbefore he entered the house and they were quite overcome\\nby the captivating manners of mrs dashwood  indeed a man\\ncould not very well be in love with either of her daughters\\nwithout extending the passion to her and elinor had the\\nsatisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself\\nhis affections seemed to reanimate towards them all\\nand his interest in their welfare again became perceptible\\nhe was not in spirits however he praised their house\\nadmired its prospect was attentive and kind but still\\nhe was not in spirits  the whole family perceived it\\nand mrs dashwood attributing it to some want of liberality\\nin his mother sat down to table indignant against all\\nselfish parents\\n\\nwhat are mrs ferrarss views for you at present edward\\nsaid she when dinner was over and they had drawn round\\nthe fire are you still to be a great orator in spite of\\nyourself\\n\\nno i hope my mother is now convinced that i have\\nno more talents than inclination for a public life\\n\\nbut how is your fame to be established for famous you\\nmust be to satisfy all your family and with no inclination\\nfor expense no affection for strangers no profession\\nand no assurance you may find it a difficult matter\\n\\ni shall not attempt it  i have no wish to be\\ndistinguished and have every reason to hope i never shall\\nthank heaven i cannot be forced into genius and eloquence\\n\\nyou have no ambition i well know  your wishes\\nare all moderate\\n\\nas moderate as those of the rest of the world\\ni believe  i wish as well as every body else to be\\nperfectly happy but like every body else it must be\\nin my own way  greatness will not make me so\\n\\nstrange that it would cried marianne  what have\\nwealth or grandeur to do with happiness\\n\\ngrandeur has but little said elinor but wealth\\nhas much to do with it\\n\\nelinor for shame said marianne money can only\\ngive happiness where there is nothing else to give it\\nbeyond a competence it can afford no real satisfaction\\nas far as mere self is concerned\\n\\nperhaps said elinor smiling we may come\\nto the same point  your competence and my wealth\\nare very much alike i dare say and without them\\nas the world goes now we shall both agree that every\\nkind of external comfort must be wanting  your ideas\\nare only more noble than mine  come what is your competence\\n\\nabout eighteen hundred or two thousand a year\\nnot more than that\\n\\nelinor laughed  two thousand a year one is my\\nwealth i guessed how it would end\\n\\nand yet two thousand ayear is a very moderate income\\nsaid marianne  a family cannot well be maintained on\\na smaller  i am sure i am not extravagant in my demands\\na proper establishment of servants a carriage perhaps two\\nand hunters cannot be supported on less\\n\\nelinor smiled again to hear her sister describing\\nso accurately their future expenses at combe magna\\n\\nhunters repeated edwardbut why must you have\\nhunters  every body does not hunt\\n\\nmarianne coloured as she replied but most people do\\n\\ni wish said margaret striking out a novel thought\\nthat somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece\\n\\noh that they would cried marianne her eyes\\nsparkling with animation and her cheeks glowing\\nwith the delight of such imaginary happiness\\n\\nwe are all unanimous in that wish i suppose\\nsaid elinor in spite of the insufficiency of wealth\\n\\noh dear cried margaret how happy i should be\\ni wonder what i should do with it\\n\\nmarianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point\\n\\ni should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself\\nsaid mrs dashwood if my children were all to be rich\\nmy help\\n\\nyou must begin your improvements on this house\\nobserved elinor and your difficulties will soon vanish\\n\\nwhat magnificent orders would travel from this family\\nto london said edward in such an event  what a happy\\nday for booksellers musicsellers and printshops  you\\nmiss dashwood would give a general commission for every\\nnew print of merit to be sent youand as for marianne\\ni know her greatness of soul there would not be music enough\\nin london to content her  and booksthomson cowper\\nscottshe would buy them all over and over again she\\nwould buy up every copy i believe to prevent their\\nfalling into unworthy hands and she would have every\\nbook that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree\\nshould not you marianne  forgive me if i am very saucy\\nbut i was willing to shew you that i had not forgot our\\nold disputes\\n\\ni love to be reminded of the past edwardwhether it\\nbe melancholy or gay i love to recall itand you\\nwill never offend me by talking of former times\\nyou are very right in supposing how my money would be\\nspentsome of it at leastmy loose cash would certainly\\nbe employed in improving my collection of music and books\\n\\nand the bulk of your fortune would be laid out\\nin annuities on the authors or their heirs\\n\\nno edward i should have something else to do\\nwith it\\n\\nperhaps then you would bestow it as a reward on that\\nperson who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim\\nthat no one can ever be in love more than once in their\\nlifeyour opinion on that point is unchanged i presume\\n\\nundoubtedly at my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed\\nit is not likely that i should now see or hear any thing to\\nchange them\\n\\nmarianne is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor\\nshe is not at all altered\\n\\nshe is only grown a little more grave than she was\\n\\nnay edward said marianne you need not reproach me\\nyou are not very gay yourself\\n\\nwhy should you think so replied he with a sigh\\nbut gaiety never was a part of my character\\n\\nnor do i think it a part of mariannes said elinor\\ni should hardly call her a lively girlshe is very earnest\\nvery eager in all she doessometimes talks a great deal\\nand always with animationbut she is not often really merry\\n\\ni believe you are right he replied and yet i\\nhave always set her down as a lively girl\\n\\ni have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes\\nsaid elinor in a total misapprehension of character in some\\npoint or other fancying people so much more gay or grave\\nor ingenious or stupid than they really are and i can\\nhardly tell why or in what the deception originated\\nsometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves\\nand very frequently by what other people say of them\\nwithout giving oneself time to deliberate and judge\\n\\nbut i thought it was right elinor said marianne\\nto be guided wholly by the opinion of other people\\ni thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient\\nto those of neighbours  this has always been your doctrine\\ni am sure\\n\\nno marianne never  my doctrine has never aimed\\nat the subjection of the understanding  all i have\\never attempted to influence has been the behaviour\\nyou must not confound my meaning  i am guilty i confess\\nof having often wished you to treat our acquaintance\\nin general with greater attention but when have i advised\\nyou to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their\\njudgment in serious matters\\n\\nyou have not been able to bring your sister over to your\\nplan of general civility said edward to elinor do you gain\\nno ground\\n\\nquite the contrary replied elinor\\nlooking expressively at marianne\\n\\nmy judgment he returned is all on your side\\nof the question but i am afraid my practice is much\\nmore on your sisters  i never wish to offend but i\\nam so foolishly shy that i often seem negligent\\nwhen i am only kept back by my natural awkwardness\\ni have frequently thought that i must have been intended\\nby nature to be fond of low company i am so little at\\nmy ease among strangers of gentility\\n\\nmarianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention\\nof hers said elinor\\n\\nshe knows her own worth too well for false shame\\nreplied edward  shyness is only the effect of a sense\\nof inferiority in some way or other  if i could persuade\\nmyself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful\\ni should not be shy\\n\\nbut you would still be reserved said marianne\\nand that is worse\\n\\nedward startedreserved am i reserved marianne\\n\\nyes very\\n\\ni do not understand you replied he colouring\\nreservedhow in what manner  what am i to tell you\\nwhat can you suppose\\n\\nelinor looked surprised at his emotion but trying\\nto laugh off the subject she said to him do not you\\nknow my sister well enough to understand what she means\\ndo not you know she calls every one reserved who does not\\ntalk as fast and admire what she admires as rapturously\\nas herself\\n\\nedward made no answer  his gravity and thoughtfulness\\nreturned on him in their fullest extentand he sat\\nfor some time silent and dull\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 18\\n\\n\\nelinor saw with great uneasiness the low spirits\\nof her friend  his visit afforded her but a very\\npartial satisfaction while his own enjoyment in it\\nappeared so imperfect  it was evident that he was unhappy\\nshe wished it were equally evident that he still\\ndistinguished her by the same affection which once\\nshe had felt no doubt of inspiring but hitherto the\\ncontinuance of his preference seemed very uncertain\\nand the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted\\none moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding\\none\\n\\nhe joined her and marianne in the breakfastroom\\nthe next morning before the others were down and marianne\\nwho was always eager to promote their happiness as far\\nas she could soon left them to themselves  but before she\\nwas half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open and\\nturning round was astonished to see edward himself come out\\n\\ni am going into the village to see my horses\\nsaid be as you are not yet ready for breakfast i shall\\nbe back again presently\\n\\n                    \\n\\nedward returned to them with fresh admiration\\nof the surrounding country in his walk to the village\\nhe had seen many parts of the valley to advantage\\nand the village itself in a much higher situation than\\nthe cottage afforded a general view of the whole which had\\nexceedingly pleased him  this was a subject which ensured\\nmariannes attention and she was beginning to describe\\nher own admiration of these scenes and to question him more\\nminutely on the objects that had particularly struck him\\nwhen edward interrupted her by saying you must not\\nenquire too far marianneremember i have no knowledge\\nin the picturesque and i shall offend you by my ignorance\\nand want of taste if we come to particulars  i shall call\\nhills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange\\nand uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged\\nand distant objects out of sight which ought only to be\\nindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere\\nyou must be satisfied with such admiration as i can\\nhonestly give  i call it a very fine countrythe\\nhills are steep the woods seem full of fine timber\\nand the valley looks comfortable and snugwith rich\\nmeadows and several neat farm houses scattered here\\nand there  it exactly answers my idea of a fine country\\nbecause it unites beauty with utilityand i dare say it\\nis a picturesque one too because you admire it i can\\neasily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories\\ngrey moss and brush wood but these are all lost on me\\ni know nothing of the picturesque\\n\\ni am afraid it is but too true said marianne\\nbut why should you boast of it\\n\\ni suspect said elinor that to avoid one kind\\nof affectation edward here falls into another  because he\\nbelieves many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties\\nof nature than they really feel and is disgusted with\\nsuch pretensions he affects greater indifference and less\\ndiscrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses\\nhe is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own\\n\\nit is very true said marianne that admiration\\nof landscape scenery is become a mere jargon\\nevery body pretends to feel and tries to describe with\\nthe taste and elegance of him who first defined what\\npicturesque beauty was  i detest jargon of every kind\\nand sometimes i have kept my feelings to myself\\nbecause i could find no language to describe them\\nin but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning\\n\\ni am convinced said edward that you really feel\\nall the delight in a fine prospect which you profess\\nto feel  but in return your sister must allow me\\nto feel no more than i profess  i like a fine prospect\\nbut not on picturesque principles  i do not like crooked\\ntwisted blasted trees  i admire them much more if they\\nare tall straight and flourishing  i do not like ruined\\ntattered cottages  i am not fond of nettles or thistles\\nor heath blossoms  i have more pleasure in a snug\\nfarmhouse than a watchtowerand a troop of tidy\\nhappy villages please me better than the finest banditti\\nin the world\\n\\nmarianne looked with amazement at edward\\nwith compassion at her sister  elinor only laughed\\n\\nthe subject was continued no farther and marianne\\nremained thoughtfully silent till a new object suddenly\\nengaged her attention  she was sitting by edward and\\nin taking his tea from mrs dashwood his hand passed\\nso directly before her as to make a ring with a plait\\nof hair in the centre very conspicuous on one of his fingers\\n\\ni never saw you wear a ring before edward she cried\\nis that fannys hair i remember her promising to give\\nyou some  but i should have thought her hair had been darker\\n\\nmarianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt\\nbut when she saw how much she had pained edward her own\\nvexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed\\nby his  he coloured very deeply and giving a momentary\\nglance at elinor replied yes it is my sisters hair\\nthe setting always casts a different shade on it\\nyou know\\n\\nelinor had met his eye and looked conscious likewise\\nthat the hair was her own she instantaneously felt as\\nwell satisfied as marianne the only difference in their\\nconclusions was that what marianne considered as a free\\ngift from her sister elinor was conscious must have been\\nprocured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself\\nshe was not in a humour however to regard it as an affront\\nand affecting to take no notice of what passed\\nby instantly talking of something else she internally\\nresolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing\\nthe hair and of satisfying herself beyond all doubt\\nthat it was exactly the shade of her own\\n\\nedwards embarrassment lasted some time and it\\nended in an absence of mind still more settled\\nhe was particularly grave the whole morning\\nmarianne severely censured herself for what she had said\\nbut her own forgiveness might have been more speedy\\nhad she known how little offence it had given her sister\\n\\nbefore the middle of the day they were visited by sir\\njohn and mrs jennings who having heard of the arrival\\nof a gentleman at the cottage came to take a survey\\nof the guest  with the assistance of his motherinlaw\\nsir john was not long in discovering that the name of\\nferrars began with an f and this prepared a future mine\\nof raillery against the devoted elinor which nothing but\\nthe newness of their acquaintance with edward could have\\nprevented from being immediately sprung  but as it was\\nshe only learned from some very significant looks how far\\ntheir penetration founded on margarets instructions extended\\n\\nsir john never came to the dashwoods without either\\ninviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink\\ntea with them that evening  on the present occasion\\nfor the better entertainment of their visitor towards\\nwhose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute\\nhe wished to engage them for both\\n\\nyou must drink tea with us to night said he\\nfor we shall be quite aloneand tomorrow you must\\nabsolutely dine with us for we shall be a large party\\n\\nmrs jennings enforced the necessity  and who knows\\nbut you may raise a dance said she  and that will\\ntempt you miss marianne\\n\\na dance cried marianne  impossible who is to dance\\n\\nwho why yourselves and the careys and whitakers\\nto be surewhat you thought nobody could dance\\nbecause a certain person that shall be nameless is gone\\n\\ni wish with all my soul cried sir john\\nthat willoughby were among us again\\n\\nthis and mariannes blushing gave new suspicions\\nto edward  and who is willoughby said he in a low voice\\nto miss dashwood by whom he was sitting\\n\\nshe gave him a brief reply  mariannes countenance\\nwas more communicative  edward saw enough to comprehend\\nnot only the meaning of others but such of mariannes\\nexpressions as had puzzled him before and when their\\nvisitors left them he went immediately round her and said\\nin a whisper i have been guessing  shall i tell you\\nmy guess\\n\\nwhat do you mean\\n\\nshall i tell you\\n\\ncertainly\\n\\nwell then i guess that mr willoughby hunts\\n\\nmarianne was surprised and confused yet she could\\nnot help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner\\nand after a moments silence said\\n\\noh edward how can youbut the time will come\\ni hopei am sure you will like him\\n\\ni do not doubt it replied he rather astonished\\nat her earnestness and warmth for had he not imagined it\\nto be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general\\nfounded only on a something or a nothing between mr willoughby\\nand herself he would not have ventured to mention it\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 19\\n\\n\\nedward remained a week at the cottage he was earnestly\\npressed by mrs dashwood to stay longer but as if he\\nwere bent only on selfmortification he seemed resolved\\nto be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at\\nthe height  his spirits during the last two or three days\\nthough still very unequal were greatly improvedhe grew\\nmore and more partial to the house and environsnever\\nspoke of going away without a sighdeclared his time\\nto be wholly disengagedeven doubted to what place he\\nshould go when he left thembut still go he must\\nnever had any week passed so quicklyhe could hardly\\nbelieve it to be gone  he said so repeatedly other things\\nhe said too which marked the turn of his feelings and gave\\nthe lie to his actions  he had no pleasure at norland\\nhe detested being in town but either to norland or london\\nhe must go  he valued their kindness beyond any thing\\nand his greatest happiness was in being with them\\nyet he must leave them at the end of a week in spite\\nof their wishes and his own and without any restraint\\non his time\\n\\nelinor placed all that was astonishing in this\\nway of acting to his mothers account and it was\\nhappy for her that he had a mother whose character\\nwas so imperfectly known to her as to be the general\\nexcuse for every thing strange on the part of her son\\ndisappointed however and vexed as she was and sometimes\\ndispleased with his uncertain behaviour to herself\\nshe was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions\\nwith all the candid allowances and generous qualifications\\nwhich had been rather more painfully extorted from her\\nfor willoughbys service by her mother  his want of spirits\\nof openness and of consistency were most usually\\nattributed to his want of independence and his better\\nknowledge of mrs ferrarss disposition and designs\\nthe shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose\\nin leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination\\nthe same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother\\nthe old wellestablished grievance of duty against will\\nparent against child was the cause of all  she would have\\nbeen glad to know when these difficulties were to cease\\nthis opposition was to yieldwhen mrs ferrars would\\nbe reformed and her son be at liberty to be happy\\nbut from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort\\nto the renewal of her confidence in edwards affection\\nto the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word\\nwhich fell from him while at barton and above all\\nto that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore\\nround his finger\\n\\ni think edward said mrs dashwood as they were\\nat breakfast the last morning you would be a happier man\\nif you had any profession to engage your time and give\\nan interest to your plans and actions  some inconvenience\\nto your friends indeed might result from ityou\\nwould not be able to give them so much of your time\\nbut with a smile you would be materially benefited\\nin one particular at leastyou would know where to go\\nwhen you left them\\n\\ni do assure you he replied that i have long\\nthought on this point as you think now  it has been\\nand is and probably will always be a heavy misfortune\\nto me that i have had no necessary business to engage me\\nno profession to give me employment or afford me any\\nthing like independence  but unfortunately my own nicety\\nand the nicety of my friends have made me what i am\\nan idle helpless being  we never could agree in our\\nchoice of a profession  i always preferred the church\\nas i still do  but that was not smart enough for my family\\nthey recommended the army  that was a great deal\\ntoo smart for me  the law was allowed to be genteel\\nenough many young men who had chambers in the temple\\nmade a very good appearance in the first circles\\nand drove about town in very knowing gigs  but i had\\nno inclination for the law even in this less abstruse\\nstudy of it which my family approved  as for the navy\\nit had fashion on its side but i was too old when the\\nsubject was first started to enter itand at length\\nas there was no necessity for my having any profession\\nat all as i might be as dashing and expensive without\\na red coat on my back as with one idleness was pronounced\\non the whole to be most advantageous and honourable\\nand a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly\\nbent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his\\nfriends to do nothing  i was therefore entered at oxford\\nand have been properly idle ever since\\n\\nthe consequence of which i suppose will be\\nsaid mrs dashwood since leisure has not promoted\\nyour own happiness that your sons will be brought up\\nto as many pursuits employments professions and trades\\nas columellas\\n\\nthey will be brought up said he in a serious accent\\nto be as unlike myself as is possible  in feeling\\nin action in condition in every thing\\n\\ncome come this is all an effusion of immediate\\nwant of spirits edward  you are in a melancholy humour\\nand fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy\\nbut remember that the pain of parting from friends\\nwill be felt by every body at times whatever be their\\neducation or state  know your own happiness  you want\\nnothing but patienceor give it a more fascinating name\\ncall it hope  your mother will secure to you in time\\nthat independence you are so anxious for it is her duty\\nand it will it must ere long become her happiness to\\nprevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent\\nhow much may not a few months do\\n\\ni think replied edward that i may defy many\\nmonths to produce any good to me\\n\\nthis desponding turn of mind though it could not\\nbe communicated to mrs dashwood gave additional pain\\nto them all in the parting which shortly took place\\nand left an uncomfortable impression on elinors\\nfeelings especially which required some trouble and time\\nto subdue  but as it was her determination to subdue it\\nand to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than\\nwhat all her family suffered on his going away she did\\nnot adopt the method so judiciously employed by marianne\\non a similar occasion to augment and fix her sorrow\\nby seeking silence solitude and idleness  their means\\nwere as different as their objects and equally suited\\nto the advancement of each\\n\\nelinor sat down to her drawingtable as soon as he\\nwas out of the house busily employed herself the whole day\\nneither sought nor avoided the mention of his name\\nappeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the\\ngeneral concerns of the family and if by this conduct\\nshe did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented\\nfrom unnecessary increase and her mother and sisters\\nwere spared much solicitude on her account\\n\\nsuch behaviour as this so exactly the reverse\\nof her own appeared no more meritorious to marianne\\nthan her own had seemed faulty to her  the business\\nof selfcommand she settled very easilywith strong\\naffections it was impossible with calm ones it could\\nhave no merit  that her sisters affections were calm\\nshe dared not deny though she blushed to acknowledge it\\nand of the strength of her own she gave a very striking proof\\nby still loving and respecting that sister in spite\\nof this mortifying conviction\\n\\nwithout shutting herself up from her family\\nor leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them\\nor lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation\\nelinor found every day afforded her leisure enough\\nto think of edward and of edwards behaviour in every\\npossible variety which the different state of her spirits\\nat different times could producewith tenderness\\npity approbation censure and doubt  there were moments\\nin abundance when if not by the absence of her mother\\nand sisters at least by the nature of their employments\\nconversation was forbidden among them and every effect\\nof solitude was produced  her mind was inevitably\\nat liberty her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere\\nand the past and the future on a subject so interesting\\nmust be before her must force her attention and engross\\nher memory her reflection and her fancy\\n\\nfrom a reverie of this kind as she sat at her\\ndrawingtable she was roused one morning soon after\\nedwards leaving them by the arrival of company\\nshe happened to be quite alone  the closing of the\\nlittle gate at the entrance of the green court in front\\nof the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw\\na large party walking up to the door  amongst them\\nwere sir john and lady middleton and mrs jennings\\nbut there were two others a gentleman and lady who were\\nquite unknown to her  she was sitting near the window\\nand as soon as sir john perceived her he left the rest\\nof the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door\\nand stepping across the turf obliged her to open the\\ncasement to speak to him though the space was so short\\nbetween the door and the window as to make it hardly\\npossible to speak at one without being heard at the other\\n\\nwell said he we have brought you some strangers\\nhow do you like them\\n\\nhush they will hear you\\n\\nnever mind if they do  it is only the palmers\\ncharlotte is very pretty i can tell you  you may see her\\nif you look this way\\n\\nas elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple\\nof minutes without taking that liberty she begged\\nto be excused\\n\\nwhere is marianne has she run away because we\\nare come i see her instrument is open\\n\\nshe is walking i believe\\n\\nthey were now joined by mrs jennings who had not\\npatience enough to wait till the door was opened before\\nshe told her story  she came hallooing to the window\\nhow do you do my dear  how does mrs dashwood do\\nand where are your sisters  what all alone you\\nwill be glad of a little company to sit with you\\ni have brought my other son and daughter to see you\\nonly think of their coming so suddenly  i thought i heard\\na carriage last night while we were drinking our tea\\nbut it never entered my head that it could be them\\ni thought of nothing but whether it might not be colonel\\nbrandon come back again so i said to sir john i do think\\ni hear a carriage perhaps it is colonel brandon come\\nback again\\n\\nelinor was obliged to turn from her in the middle\\nof her story to receive the rest of the party lady\\nmiddleton introduced the two strangers mrs dashwood\\nand margaret came down stairs at the same time and they\\nall sat down to look at one another while mrs jennings\\ncontinued her story as she walked through the passage\\ninto the parlour attended by sir john\\n\\nmrs palmer was several years younger than lady\\nmiddleton and totally unlike her in every respect\\nshe was short and plump had a very pretty face\\nand the finest expression of good humour in it that could\\npossibly be  her manners were by no means so elegant\\nas her sisters but they were much more prepossessing\\nshe came in with a smile smiled all the time of her visit\\nexcept when she laughed and smiled when she went away\\nher husband was a grave looking young man of five or six\\nand twenty with an air of more fashion and sense than\\nhis wife but of less willingness to please or be pleased\\nhe entered the room with a look of selfconsequence\\nslightly bowed to the ladies without speaking a word\\nand after briefly surveying them and their apartments\\ntook up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it\\nas long as he staid\\n\\nmrs palmer on the contrary who was strongly endowed\\nby nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy\\nwas hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour\\nand every thing in it burst forth\\n\\nwell what a delightful room this is i never\\nsaw anything so charming  only think mamma how it\\nis improved since i was here last i always thought it\\nsuch a sweet place maam turning to mrs dashwood\\nbut you have made it so charming  only look sister\\nhow delightful every thing is how i should like such\\na house for myself  should not you mr palmer\\n\\nmr palmer made her no answer and did not even raise\\nhis eyes from the newspaper\\n\\nmr palmer does not hear me said she laughing\\nhe never does sometimes  it is so ridiculous\\n\\nthis was quite a new idea to mrs dashwood she had\\nnever been used to find wit in the inattention of any one\\nand could not help looking with surprise at them both\\n\\nmrs jennings in the meantime talked on as loud\\nas she could and continued her account of their surprise\\nthe evening before on seeing their friends without\\nceasing till every thing was told  mrs palmer laughed\\nheartily at the recollection of their astonishment\\nand every body agreed two or three times over that it\\nhad been quite an agreeable surprise\\n\\nyou may believe how glad we all were to see them\\nadded mrs jennings leaning forward towards elinor\\nand speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard\\nby no one else though they were seated on different sides\\nof the room but however i cant help wishing they had\\nnot travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey\\nof it for they came all round by london upon account\\nof some business for you know nodding significantly and\\npointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation\\ni wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning\\nbut she would come with us she longed so much to see\\nyou all\\n\\nmrs palmer laughed and said it would not do her\\nany harm\\n\\nshe expects to be confined in february\\ncontinued mrs jennings\\n\\nlady middleton could no longer endure such a conversation\\nand therefore exerted herself to ask mr palmer if there\\nwas any news in the paper\\n\\nno none at all he replied and read on\\n\\nhere comes marianne cried sir john  now palmer\\nyou shall see a monstrous pretty girl\\n\\nhe immediately went into the passage opened the front door\\nand ushered her in himself  mrs jennings asked her\\nas soon as she appeared if she had not been to allenham\\nand mrs palmer laughed so heartily at the question\\nas to show she understood it  mr palmer looked up\\non her entering the room stared at her some minutes\\nand then returned to his newspaper  mrs palmers eye\\nwas now caught by the drawings which hung round the room\\nshe got up to examine them\\n\\noh dear how beautiful these are  well how delightful\\ndo but look mama how sweet i declare they are quite charming\\ni could look at them for ever and then sitting down again\\nshe very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room\\n\\nwhen lady middleton rose to go away mr palmer\\nrose also laid down the newspaper stretched himself\\nand looked at them all around\\n\\nmy love have you been asleep said his wife laughing\\n\\nhe made her no answer and only observed after again\\nexamining the room that it was very low pitched\\nand that the ceiling was crooked  he then made his bow\\nand departed with the rest\\n\\nsir john had been very urgent with them all to\\nspend the next day at the park  mrs dashwood who did\\nnot chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined\\nat the cottage absolutely refused on her own account\\nher daughters might do as they pleased  but they had no\\ncuriosity to see how mr and mrs palmer ate their dinner\\nand no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way\\nthey attempted therefore likewise to excuse themselves\\nthe weather was uncertain and not likely to be good\\nbut sir john would not be satisfiedthe carriage should\\nbe sent for them and they must come  lady middleton too\\nthough she did not press their mother pressed them\\nmrs jennings and mrs palmer joined their entreaties all\\nseemed equally anxious to avoid a family party and the young\\nladies were obliged to yield\\n\\nwhy should they ask us said marianne as soon as they\\nwere gone  the rent of this cottage is said to be low\\nbut we have it on very hard terms if we are to dine\\nat the park whenever any one is staying either with them\\nor with us\\n\\nthey mean no less to be civil and kind to us now\\nsaid elinor by these frequent invitations than by\\nthose which we received from them a few weeks ago\\nthe alteration is not in them if their parties are grown\\ntedious and dull  we must look for the change elsewhere\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 20\\n\\n\\nas the miss dashwoods entered the drawingroom of the park\\nthe next day at one door mrs palmer came running in at\\nthe other looking as good humoured and merry as before\\nshe took them all most affectionately by the hand\\nand expressed great delight in seeing them again\\n\\ni am so glad to see you said she seating herself\\nbetween elinor and marianne for it is so bad a day i was\\nafraid you might not come which would be a shocking thing\\nas we go away again tomorrow we must go for the westons\\ncome to us next week you know  it was quite a sudden thing\\nour coming at all and i knew nothing of it till the carriage\\nwas coming to the door and then mr palmer asked me if i\\nwould go with him to barton  he is so droll he never\\ntells me any thing i am so sorry we cannot stay longer\\nhowever we shall meet again in town very soon i hope\\n\\nthey were obliged to put an end to such an expectation\\n\\nnot go to town cried mrs palmer with a laugh\\ni shall be quite disappointed if you do not  i could\\nget the nicest house in world for you next door to ours\\nin hanoversquare  you must come indeed  i am sure\\ni shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till\\ni am confined if mrs dashwood should not like to go\\ninto public\\n\\nthey thanked her but were obliged to resist all\\nher entreaties\\n\\noh my love cried mrs palmer to her husband\\nwho just then entered the roomyou must help me to\\npersuade the miss dashwoods to go to town this winter\\n\\nher love made no answer and after slightly bowing\\nto the ladies began complaining of the weather\\n\\nhow horrid all this is said he  such weather\\nmakes every thing and every body disgusting  dullness\\nis as much produced within doors as without by rain\\nit makes one detest all ones acquaintance  what the\\ndevil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room\\nin his house  how few people know what comfort is  sir\\njohn is as stupid as the weather\\n\\nthe rest of the company soon dropt in\\n\\ni am afraid miss marianne said sir john you have\\nnot been able to take your usual walk to allenham today\\n\\nmarianne looked very grave and said nothing\\n\\noh dont be so sly before us said mrs palmer\\nfor we know all about it i assure you and i admire your\\ntaste very much for i think he is extremely handsome\\nwe do not live a great way from him in the country you know\\nnot above ten miles i dare say\\n\\nmuch nearer thirty said her husband\\n\\nah well there is not much difference\\ni never was at his house but they say it is a sweet\\npretty place\\n\\nas vile a spot as i ever saw in my life\\nsaid mr palmer\\n\\nmarianne remained perfectly silent though her\\ncountenance betrayed her interest in what was said\\n\\nis it very ugly continued mrs palmerthen it\\nmust be some other place that is so pretty i suppose\\n\\nwhen they were seated in the dining room sir john\\nobserved with regret that they were only eight all together\\n\\nmy dear said he to his lady it is very provoking\\nthat we should be so few  why did not you ask the gilberts\\nto come to us today\\n\\ndid not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me\\nabout it before that it could not be done  they dined\\nwith us last\\n\\nyou and i sir john said mrs jennings\\nshould not stand upon such ceremony\\n\\nthen you would be very illbred cried mr palmer\\n\\nmy love you contradict every body said his wife\\nwith her usual laugh  do you know that you are quite rude\\n\\ni did not know i contradicted any body in calling\\nyour mother illbred\\n\\nay you may abuse me as you please said the goodnatured\\nold lady you have taken charlotte off my hands and cannot\\ngive her back again  so there i have the whip hand of you\\n\\ncharlotte laughed heartily to think that her\\nhusband could not get rid of her and exultingly said\\nshe did not care how cross he was to her as they must\\nlive together  it was impossible for any one to be more\\nthoroughly goodnatured or more determined to be happy\\nthan mrs palmer  the studied indifference insolence\\nand discontent of her husband gave her no pain\\nand when he scolded or abused her she was highly diverted\\n\\nmr palmer is so droll said she in a whisper\\nto elinor  he is always out of humour\\n\\nelinor was not inclined after a little observation\\nto give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly\\nillnatured or illbred as he wished to appear\\nhis temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding\\nlike many others of his sex that through some unaccountable\\nbias in favour of beauty he was the husband of a very silly\\nwomanbut she knew that this kind of blunder was too\\ncommon for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it\\nit was rather a wish of distinction she believed\\nwhich produced his contemptuous treatment of every body\\nand his general abuse of every thing before him\\nit was the desire of appearing superior to other people\\nthe motive was too common to be wondered at but the means\\nhowever they might succeed by establishing his superiority\\nin illbreeding were not likely to attach any one to him\\nexcept his wife\\n\\noh my dear miss dashwood said mrs palmer soon afterwards\\ni have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister\\nwill you come and spend some time at cleveland this\\nchristmas  now pray doand come while the westons are\\nwith us  you cannot think how happy i shall be  it will\\nbe quite delightfulmy love applying to her husband\\ndont you long to have the miss dashwoods come to cleveland\\n\\ncertainly he replied with a sneeri came\\ninto devonshire with no other view\\n\\nthere nowsaid his lady you see mr palmer\\nexpects you so you cannot refuse to come\\n\\nthey both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation\\n\\nbut indeed you must and shall come  i am sure you\\nwill like it of all things  the westons will be with us\\nand it will be quite delightful  you cannot think\\nwhat a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gay now\\nfor mr palmer is always going about the country canvassing\\nagainst the election and so many people came to dine\\nwith us that i never saw before it is quite charming  but\\npoor fellow it is very fatiguing to him for he is forced\\nto make every body like him\\n\\nelinor could hardly keep her countenance as she\\nassented to the hardship of such an obligation\\n\\nhow charming it will be said charlotte when he\\nis in parliamentwont it how i shall laugh  it will\\nbe so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him\\nwith an mpbut do you know he says he will never frank\\nfor me  he declares he wont  dont you mr palmer\\n\\nmr palmer took no notice of her\\n\\nhe cannot bear writing you know she continued\\nhe says it is quite shocking\\n\\nno said he i never said any thing so irrational\\ndont palm all your abuses of languages upon me\\n\\nthere now you see how droll he is  this is always\\nthe way with him  sometimes he wont speak to me for half\\na day together and then he comes out with something\\nso drollall about any thing in the world\\n\\nshe surprised elinor very much as they returned\\ninto the drawingroom by asking her whether she did\\nnot like mr palmer excessively\\n\\ncertainly said elinor he seems very agreeable\\n\\nwelli am so glad you do  i thought you would\\nhe is so pleasant and mr palmer is excessively pleased\\nwith you and your sisters i can tell you and you cant\\nthink how disappointed he will be if you dont come\\nto clevelandi cant imagine why you should object\\nto it\\n\\nelinor was again obliged to decline her invitation\\nand by changing the subject put a stop to her entreaties\\nshe thought it probable that as they lived in the\\nsame county mrs palmer might be able to give some\\nmore particular account of willoughbys general\\ncharacter than could be gathered from the middletons\\npartial acquaintance with him and she was eager to gain\\nfrom any one such a confirmation of his merits as might\\nremove the possibility of fear from marianne  she began\\nby inquiring if they saw much of mr willoughby at cleveland\\nand whether they were intimately acquainted with him\\n\\noh dear yes i know him extremely well\\nreplied mrs palmernot that i ever spoke\\nto him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town\\nsomehow or other i never happened to be staying at barton\\nwhile he was at allenham  mama saw him here once before\\nbut i was with my uncle at weymouth  however i dare say\\nwe should have seen a great deal of him in somersetshire\\nif it had not happened very unluckily that we should never\\nhave been in the country together  he is very little\\nat combe i believe but if he were ever so much there\\ni do not think mr palmer would visit him for he is\\nin the opposition you know and besides it is such a\\nway off  i know why you inquire about him very well\\nyour sister is to marry him  i am monstrous glad of it\\nfor then i shall have her for a neighbour you know\\n\\nupon my word replied elinor you know much\\nmore of the matter than i do if you have any reason\\nto expect such a match\\n\\ndont pretend to deny it because you know it is\\nwhat every body talks of  i assure you i heard of it\\nin my way through town\\n\\nmy dear mrs palmer\\n\\nupon my honour i didi met colonel brandon\\nmonday morning in bondstreet just before we left town\\nand he told me of it directly\\n\\nyou surprise me very much  colonel brandon tell\\nyou of it  surely you must be mistaken  to give such\\nintelligence to a person who could not be interested in it\\neven if it were true is not what i should expect colonel\\nbrandon to do\\n\\nbut i do assure you it was so for all that\\nand i will tell you how it happened  when we met him\\nhe turned back and walked with us and so we began talking\\nof my brother and sister and one thing and another\\nand i said to him so colonel there is a new family\\ncome to barton cottage i hear and mama sends me word\\nthey are very pretty and that one of them is going to be\\nmarried to mr willoughby of combe magna  is it true\\npray for of course you must know as you have been in\\ndevonshire so lately\\n\\nand what did the colonel say\\n\\nohhe did not say much but he looked as if he\\nknew it to be true so from that moment i set it down\\nas certain  it will be quite delightful i declare\\nwhen is it to take place\\n\\nmr brandon was very well i hope\\n\\noh yes quite well and so full of your praises\\nhe did nothing but say fine things of you\\n\\ni am flattered by his commendation  he seems\\nan excellent man and i think him uncommonly pleasing\\n\\nso do ihe is such a charming man that it\\nis quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull\\nmamma says he was in love with your sister too\\ni assure you it was a great compliment if he was for he\\nhardly ever falls in love with any body\\n\\nis mr willoughby much known in your part\\nof somersetshire said elinor\\n\\noh yes extremely well that is i do not believe\\nmany people are acquainted with him because combe magna\\nis so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable\\ni assure you  nobody is more liked than mr willoughby\\nwherever he goes and so you may tell your sister\\nshe is a monstrous lucky girl to get him upon my honour\\nnot but that he is much more lucky in getting her\\nbecause she is so very handsome and agreeable that nothing\\ncan be good enough for her  however i dont think\\nher hardly at all handsomer than you i assure you\\nfor i think you both excessively pretty and so does\\nmr palmer too i am sure though we could not get him\\nto own it last night\\n\\nmrs palmers information respecting willoughby\\nwas not very material but any testimony in his favour\\nhowever small was pleasing to her\\n\\ni am so glad we are got acquainted at last\\ncontinued charlotteand now i hope we shall always be\\ngreat friends  you cant think how much i longed to see you\\nit is so delightful that you should live at the cottage\\nnothing can be like it to be sure  and i am so glad\\nyour sister is going to be well married  i hope you will\\nbe a great deal at combe magna  it is a sweet place\\nby all accounts\\n\\nyou have been long acquainted with colonel brandon\\nhave not you\\n\\nyes a great while ever since my sister married\\nhe was a particular friend of sir johns i believe\\nshe added in a low voice he would have been very\\nglad to have had me if he could  sir john and lady\\nmiddleton wished it very much  but mama did not think\\nthe match good enough for me otherwise sir john would\\nhave mentioned it to the colonel and we should have been\\nmarried immediately\\n\\ndid not colonel brandon know of sir johns proposal\\nto your mother before it was made  had he never owned\\nhis affection to yourself\\n\\noh no but if mama had not objected to it\\ni dare say he would have liked it of all things\\nhe had not seen me then above twice for it was before\\ni left school  however i am much happier as i am\\nmr palmer is the kind of man i like\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 21\\n\\n\\nthe palmers returned to cleveland the next day\\nand the two families at barton were again left to entertain\\neach other  but this did not last long elinor had hardly\\ngot their last visitors out of her head had hardly done\\nwondering at charlottes being so happy without a cause\\nat mr palmers acting so simply with good abilities\\nand at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between\\nhusband and wife before sir johns and mrs jenningss\\nactive zeal in the cause of society procured her some\\nother new acquaintance to see and observe\\n\\nin a mornings excursion to exeter they had met with\\ntwo young ladies whom mrs jennings had the satisfaction\\nof discovering to be her relations and this was enough\\nfor sir john to invite them directly to the park\\nas soon as their present engagements at exeter were over\\ntheir engagements at exeter instantly gave way before\\nsuch an invitation and lady middleton was thrown into\\nno little alarm on the return of sir john by hearing\\nthat she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls\\nwhom she had never seen in her life and of whose elegance\\nwhose tolerable gentility even she could have no proof\\nfor the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject\\nwent for nothing at all  their being her relations too\\nmade it so much the worse and mrs jenningss attempts\\nat consolation were therefore unfortunately founded\\nwhen she advised her daughter not to care about their being\\nso fashionable because they were all cousins and must put\\nup with one another  as it was impossible however now to\\nprevent their coming lady middleton resigned herself to the\\nidea of it with all the philosophy of a wellbred woman\\ncontenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle\\nreprimand on the subject five or six times every day\\n\\nthe young ladies arrived their appearance was by\\nno means ungenteel or unfashionable  their dress was\\nvery smart their manners very civil they were delighted\\nwith the house and in raptures with the furniture\\nand they happened to be so doatingly fond of children\\nthat lady middletons good opinion was engaged in their\\nfavour before they had been an hour at the park\\nshe declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed\\nwhich for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration\\nsir johns confidence in his own judgment rose with this\\nanimated praise and he set off directly for the cottage\\nto tell the miss dashwoods of the miss steeles arrival\\nand to assure them of their being the sweetest girls\\nin the world  from such commendation as this however\\nthere was not much to be learned elinor well knew\\nthat the sweetest girls in the world were to be met\\nwith in every part of england under every possible\\nvariation of form face temper and understanding\\nsir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly\\nand look at his guests  benevolent philanthropic man  it\\nwas painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself\\n\\ndo come now said hepray comeyou must comei\\ndeclare you shall comeyou cant think how you will\\nlike them  lucy is monstrous pretty and so good humoured\\nand agreeable  the children are all hanging about her already\\nas if she was an old acquaintance  and they both long\\nto see you of all things for they have heard at exeter\\nthat you are the most beautiful creatures in the world\\nand i have told them it is all very true and a great\\ndeal more  you will be delighted with them i am sure\\nthey have brought the whole coach full of playthings\\nfor the children  how can you be so cross as not to come\\nwhy they are your cousins you know after a fashion\\nyou are my cousins and they are my wifes so you must\\nbe related\\n\\nbut sir john could not prevail  he could only obtain\\na promise of their calling at the park within a day or two\\nand then left them in amazement at their indifference\\nto walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the\\nmiss steeles as he had been already boasting of the miss\\nsteeles to them\\n\\nwhen their promised visit to the park and consequent\\nintroduction to these young ladies took place they found\\nin the appearance of the eldest who was nearly thirty\\nwith a very plain and not a sensible face nothing to admire\\nbut in the other who was not more than two or three\\nand twenty they acknowledged considerable beauty her\\nfeatures were pretty and she had a sharp quick eye\\nand a smartness of air which though it did not give\\nactual elegance or grace gave distinction to her person\\ntheir manners were particularly civil and elinor soon\\nallowed them credit for some kind of sense when she\\nsaw with what constant and judicious attention they\\nwere making themselves agreeable to lady middleton\\nwith her children they were in continual raptures\\nextolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring\\ntheir whims and such of their time as could be spared from\\nthe importunate demands which this politeness made on it\\nwas spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing\\nif she happened to be doing any thing or in taking patterns\\nof some elegant new dress in which her appearance\\nthe day before had thrown them into unceasing delight\\nfortunately for those who pay their court through\\nsuch foibles a fond mother though in pursuit of praise\\nfor her children the most rapacious of human beings\\nis likewise the most credulous her demands are exorbitant\\nbut she will swallow any thing and the excessive\\naffection and endurance of the miss steeles towards\\nher offspring were viewed therefore by lady middleton\\nwithout the smallest surprise or distrust  she saw with\\nmaternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments\\nand mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted\\nshe saw their sashes untied their hair pulled about\\ntheir ears their workbags searched and their knives\\nand scissors stolen away and felt no doubt of its being\\na reciprocal enjoyment  it suggested no other surprise\\nthan that elinor and marianne should sit so composedly by\\nwithout claiming a share in what was passing\\n\\njohn is in such spirits today said she on his\\ntaking miss steeless pocket handkerchief and throwing\\nit out of windowhe is full of monkey tricks\\n\\nand soon afterwards on the second boys violently\\npinching one of the same ladys fingers she fondly observed\\nhow playful william is\\n\\nand here is my sweet little annamaria she added\\ntenderly caressing a little girl of three years old\\nwho had not made a noise for the last two minutes\\nand she is always so gentle and quietnever was there\\nsuch a quiet little thing\\n\\nbut unfortunately in bestowing these embraces\\na pin in her ladyships head dress slightly scratching\\nthe childs neck produced from this pattern of gentleness\\nsuch violent screams as could hardly be outdone by any\\ncreature professedly noisy  the mothers consternation\\nwas excessive but it could not surpass the alarm of the\\nmiss steeles and every thing was done by all three\\nin so critical an emergency which affection could suggest\\nas likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer\\nshe was seated in her mothers lap covered with kisses\\nher wound bathed with lavenderwater by one of the\\nmiss steeles who was on her knees to attend her\\nand her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other\\nwith such a reward for her tears the child was too wise\\nto cease crying  she still screamed and sobbed lustily\\nkicked her two brothers for offering to touch her and all\\ntheir united soothings were ineffectual till lady middleton\\nluckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress\\nlast week some apricot marmalade had been successfully\\napplied for a bruised temple the same remedy was eagerly\\nproposed for this unfortunate scratch and a slight\\nintermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it\\ngave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected\\nshe was carried out of the room therefore in her\\nmothers arms in quest of this medicine and as the\\ntwo boys chose to follow though earnestly entreated\\nby their mother to stay behind the four young ladies\\nwere left in a quietness which the room had not known for\\nmany hours\\n\\npoor little creatures said miss steele as soon\\nas they were gone  it might have been a very sad accident\\n\\nyet i hardly know how cried marianne unless it\\nhad been under totally different circumstances\\nbut this is the usual way of heightening alarm where there\\nis nothing to be alarmed at in reality\\n\\nwhat a sweet woman lady middleton is said lucy steele\\n\\nmarianne was silent it was impossible for her to say\\nwhat she did not feel however trivial the occasion\\nand upon elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies\\nwhen politeness required it always fell  she did her\\nbest when thus called on by speaking of lady middleton\\nwith more warmth than she felt though with far less than\\nmiss lucy\\n\\nand sir john too cried the elder sister\\nwhat a charming man he is\\n\\nhere too miss dashwoods commendation being only\\nsimple and just came in without any eclat  she merely\\nobserved that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly\\n\\nand what a charming little family they have  i\\nnever saw such fine children in my lifei declare i\\nquite doat upon them already and indeed i am always\\ndistractedly fond of children\\n\\ni should guess so said elinor with a smile\\nfrom what i have witnessed this morning\\n\\ni have a notion said lucy you think the little\\nmiddletons rather too much indulged perhaps they may be the\\noutside of enough but it is so natural in lady middleton\\nand for my part i love to see children full of life\\nand spirits i cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet\\n\\ni confess replied elinor that while i am at\\nbarton park i never think of tame and quiet children\\nwith any abhorrence\\n\\na short pause succeeded this speech which was first\\nbroken by miss steele who seemed very much disposed\\nfor conversation and who now said rather abruptly\\nand how do you like devonshire miss dashwood  i suppose\\nyou were very sorry to leave sussex\\n\\nin some surprise at the familiarity of this question\\nor at least of the manner in which it was spoken\\nelinor replied that she was\\n\\nnorland is a prodigious beautiful place is not it\\nadded miss steele\\n\\nwe have heard sir john admire it excessively\\nsaid lucy who seemed to think some apology necessary\\nfor the freedom of her sister\\n\\ni think every one must admire it replied elinor\\nwho ever saw the place though it is not to be supposed\\nthat any one can estimate its beauties as we do\\n\\nand had you a great many smart beaux there  i\\nsuppose you have not so many in this part of the world\\nfor my part i think they are a vast addition always\\n\\nbut why should you think said lucy looking ashamed\\nof her sister that there are not as many genteel young\\nmen in devonshire as sussex\\n\\nnay my dear im sure i dont pretend to say that there\\nant  im sure theres a vast many smart beaux in exeter\\nbut you know how could i tell what smart beaux there\\nmight be about norland and i was only afraid the miss\\ndashwoods might find it dull at barton if they had not\\nso many as they used to have  but perhaps you young ladies\\nmay not care about the beaux and had as lief be without\\nthem as with them  for my part i think they are vastly\\nagreeable provided they dress smart and behave civil\\nbut i cant bear to see them dirty and nasty  now theres\\nmr rose at exeter a prodigious smart young man\\nquite a beau clerk to mr simpson you know and yet if you\\ndo but meet him of a morning he is not fit to be seen\\ni suppose your brother was quite a beau miss dashwood\\nbefore he married as he was so rich\\n\\nupon my word replied elinor i cannot tell you\\nfor i do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word\\nbut this i can say that if he ever was a beau before\\nhe married he is one still for there is not the smallest\\nalteration in him\\n\\noh dear one never thinks of married mens being\\nbeauxthey have something else to do\\n\\nlord anne cried her sister you can talk of\\nnothing but beauxyou will make miss dashwood believe you\\nthink of nothing else and then to turn the discourse\\nshe began admiring the house and the furniture\\n\\nthis specimen of the miss steeles was enough\\nthe vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left\\nher no recommendation and as elinor was not blinded\\nby the beauty or the shrewd look of the youngest\\nto her want of real elegance and artlessness she left\\nthe house without any wish of knowing them better\\n\\nnot so the miss steelesthey came from exeter well\\nprovided with admiration for the use of sir john middleton\\nhis family and all his relations and no niggardly\\nproportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins whom they\\ndeclared to be the most beautiful elegant accomplished\\nand agreeable girls they had ever beheld and with whom\\nthey were particularly anxious to be better acquainted\\nand to be better acquainted therefore elinor soon found\\nwas their inevitable lot for as sir john was entirely\\non the side of the miss steeles their party would be\\ntoo strong for opposition and that kind of intimacy\\nmust be submitted to which consists of sitting an hour\\nor two together in the same room almost every day\\nsir john could do no more but he did not know that any\\nmore was required to be together was in his opinion\\nto be intimate and while his continual schemes for their\\nmeeting were effectual he had not a doubt of their being\\nestablished friends\\n\\nto do him justice he did every thing in his power\\nto promote their unreserve by making the miss steeles\\nacquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins\\nsituations in the most delicate particularsand elinor\\nhad not seen them more than twice before the eldest of\\nthem wished her joy on her sisters having been so lucky\\nas to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she\\ncame to barton\\n\\ntwill be a fine thing to have her married so young\\nto be sure said she and i hear he is quite a beau\\nand prodigious handsome  and i hope you may have as good\\nluck yourself soonbut perhaps you may have a friend\\nin the corner already\\n\\nelinor could not suppose that sir john would be more\\nnice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for edward\\nthan he had been with respect to marianne indeed it was\\nrather his favourite joke of the two as being somewhat\\nnewer and more conjectural and since edwards visit\\nthey had never dined together without his drinking to her\\nbest affections with so much significancy and so many nods\\nand winks as to excite general attention  the letter f\\nhad been likewise invariably brought forward and found\\nproductive of such countless jokes that its character\\nas the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long\\nestablished with elinor\\n\\nthe miss steeles as she expected had now all the\\nbenefit of these jokes and in the eldest of them they\\nraised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman\\nalluded to which though often impertinently expressed\\nwas perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness\\ninto the concerns of their family  but sir john did not\\nsport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise\\nfor he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name\\nas miss steele had in hearing it\\n\\nhis name is ferrars said he in a very audible whisper\\nbut pray do not tell it for its a great secret\\n\\nferrars repeated miss steele mr ferrars is\\nthe happy man is he what your sisterinlaws brother\\nmiss dashwood a very agreeable young man to be sure\\ni know him very well\\n\\nhow can you say so anne cried lucy who generally\\nmade an amendment to all her sisters assertions\\nthough we have seen him once or twice at my uncles it\\nis rather too much to pretend to know him very well\\n\\nelinor heard all this with attention and surprise\\nand who was this uncle  where did he live  how came\\nthey acquainted  she wished very much to have the subject\\ncontinued though she did not chuse to join in it herself\\nbut nothing more of it was said and for the first time\\nin her life she thought mrs jennings deficient either\\nin curiosity after petty information or in a disposition\\nto communicate it  the manner in which miss steele had\\nspoken of edward increased her curiosity for it struck\\nher as being rather illnatured and suggested the suspicion\\nof that ladys knowing or fancying herself to know something\\nto his disadvantagebut her curiosity was unavailing\\nfor no farther notice was taken of mr ferrarss name by\\nmiss steele when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir\\njohn\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 22\\n\\n\\nmarianne who had never much toleration for any\\nthing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts\\nor even difference of taste from herself was at\\nthis time particularly illdisposed from the state\\nof her spirits to be pleased with the miss steeles\\nor to encourage their advances and to the invariable\\ncoldness of her behaviour towards them which checked every\\nendeavour at intimacy on their side elinor principally\\nattributed that preference of herself which soon became\\nevident in the manners of both but especially of lucy\\nwho missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation\\nor of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy\\nand frank communication of her sentiments\\n\\nlucy was naturally clever her remarks were often\\njust and amusing and as a companion for half an hour\\nelinor frequently found her agreeable but her powers\\nhad received no aid from education she was ignorant\\nand illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement\\nher want of information in the most common particulars\\ncould not be concealed from miss dashwood in spite of her\\nconstant endeavour to appear to advantage  elinor saw\\nand pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education\\nmight have rendered so respectable but she saw with less\\ntenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy\\nof rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions\\nher assiduities her flatteries at the park betrayed\\nand she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company\\nof a person who joined insincerity with ignorance\\nwhose want of instruction prevented their meeting\\nin conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct\\ntoward others made every shew of attention and deference\\ntowards herself perfectly valueless\\n\\nyou will think my question an odd one i dare say\\nsaid lucy to her one day as they were walking together\\nfrom the park to the cottagebut pray are you\\npersonally acquainted with your sisterinlaws mother\\nmrs ferrars\\n\\nelinor did think the question a very odd one\\nand her countenance expressed it as she answered that she\\nhad never seen mrs ferrars\\n\\nindeed replied lucy i wonder at that for i\\nthought you must have seen her at norland sometimes\\nthen perhaps you cannot tell me what sort of a woman\\nshe is\\n\\nno returned elinor cautious of giving her real\\nopinion of edwards mother and not very desirous\\nof satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity\\ni know nothing of her\\n\\ni am sure you think me very strange for enquiring\\nabout her in such a way said lucy eyeing elinor attentively\\nas she spoke but perhaps there may be reasonsi wish\\ni might venture but however i hope you will do me the justice\\nof believing that i do not mean to be impertinent\\n\\nelinor made her a civil reply and they walked on\\nfor a few minutes in silence  it was broken by lucy\\nwho renewed the subject again by saying with some\\nhesitation\\n\\ni cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious\\ni am sure i would rather do any thing in the world than be\\nthought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth\\nhaving as yours  and i am sure i should not have the smallest\\nfear of trusting you indeed i should be very glad of your\\nadvice how to manage in such and uncomfortable situation\\nas i am but however there is no occasion to trouble you\\ni am sorry you do not happen to know mrs ferrars\\n\\ni am sorry i do not said elinor in great astonishment\\nif it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her\\nbut really i never understood that you were at all connected\\nwith that family and therefore i am a little surprised\\ni confess at so serious an inquiry into her character\\n\\ni dare say you are and i am sure i do not at all\\nwonder at it  but if i dared tell you all you would not be\\nso much surprised  mrs ferrars is certainly nothing to me\\nat presentbut the time may comehow soon it will come\\nmust depend upon herselfwhen we may be very intimately\\nconnected\\n\\nshe looked down as she said this amiably bashful\\nwith only one side glance at her companion to observe its\\neffect on her\\n\\ngood heavens cried elinor what do you mean\\nare you acquainted with mr robert ferrars  can you be\\nand she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such\\na sisterinlaw\\n\\nno replied lucy not to mr robert ferrarsi\\nnever saw him in my life but fixing her eyes upon elinor\\nto his eldest brother\\n\\nwhat felt elinor at that moment astonishment\\nthat would have been as painful as it was strong had not\\nan immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it\\nshe turned towards lucy in silent amazement unable to divine\\nthe reason or object of such a declaration and though\\nher complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity\\nand felt in no danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon\\n\\nyou may well be surprised continued lucy\\nfor to be sure you could have had no idea of it before\\nfor i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it\\nto you or any of your family because it was always meant\\nto be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully\\nkept so by me to this hour  not a soul of all my relations\\nknow of it but anne and i never should have mentioned\\nit to you if i had not felt the greatest dependence\\nin the world upon your secrecy and i really thought my\\nbehaviour in asking so many questions about mrs ferrars\\nmust seem so odd that it ought to be explained\\nand i do not think mr ferrars can be displeased\\nwhen he knows i have trusted you because i know he has\\nthe highest opinion in the world of all your family\\nand looks upon yourself and the other miss dashwoods quite\\nas his own sistersshe paused\\n\\nelinor for a few moments remained silent\\nher astonishment at what she heard was at first too\\ngreat for words but at length forcing herself to speak\\nand to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner\\nwhich tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude\\nmay i ask if your engagement is of long standing\\n\\nwe have been engaged these four years\\n\\nfour years\\n\\nyes\\n\\nelinor though greatly shocked still felt unable\\nto believe it\\n\\ni did not know said she that you were even\\nacquainted till the other day\\n\\nour acquaintance however is of many years date\\nhe was under my uncles care you know a considerable while\\n\\nyour uncle\\n\\nyes mr pratt  did you never hear him talk\\nof mr pratt\\n\\ni think i have replied elinor with an exertion\\nof spirits which increased with her increase of emotion\\n\\nhe was four years with my uncle who lives at longstaple\\nnear plymouth  it was there our acquaintance begun\\nfor my sister and me was often staying with my uncle\\nand it was there our engagement was formed though not till\\na year after he had quitted as a pupil but he was almost\\nalways with us afterwards  i was very unwilling to enter\\ninto it as you may imagine without the knowledge and\\napprobation of his mother but i was too young and loved\\nhim too well to be so prudent as i ought to have been\\nthough you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood\\nyou must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is\\nvery capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him\\n\\ncertainly answered elinor without knowing what\\nshe said but after a moments reflection she added\\nwith revived security of edwards honour and love\\nand her companions falsehoodengaged to mr edward\\nferrarsi confess myself so totally surprised at\\nwhat you tell me that reallyi beg your pardon\\nbut surely there must be some mistake of person or name\\nwe cannot mean the same mr ferrars\\n\\nwe can mean no other cried lucy smiling  mr edward\\nferrars the eldest son of mrs ferrars of park street\\nand brother of your sisterinlaw mrs john dashwood\\nis the person i mean you must allow that i am not likely\\nto be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness\\ndepends\\n\\nit is strange replied elinor in a most painful perplexity\\nthat i should never have heard him even mention your name\\n\\nno considering our situation it was not strange\\nour first care has been to keep the matter secret\\nyou knew nothing of me or my family and therefore\\nthere could be no occasion for ever mentioning my name\\nto you and as he was always particularly afraid of his\\nsisters suspecting any thing that was reason enough\\nfor his not mentioning it\\n\\nshe was silentelinors security sunk but her\\nselfcommand did not sink with it\\n\\nfour years you have been engaged said she\\nwith a firm voice\\n\\nyes and heaven knows how much longer we may have\\nto wait  poor edward  it puts him quite out of heart\\nthen taking a small miniature from her pocket she added\\nto prevent the possibility of mistake be so good as to look\\nat this face  it does not do him justice to be sure\\nbut yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person\\nit was drew fori have had it above these three years\\n\\nshe put it into her hands as she spoke and when elinor\\nsaw the painting whatever other doubts her fear of a\\ntoo hasty decision or her wish of detecting falsehood\\nmight suffer to linger in her mind she could have none of\\nits being edwards face  she returned it almost instantly\\nacknowledging the likeness\\n\\ni have never been able continued lucy to give\\nhim my picture in return which i am very much vexed at\\nfor he has been always so anxious to get it  but i am\\ndetermined to set for it the very first opportunity\\n\\nyou are quite in the right replied elinor calmly\\nthey then proceeded a few paces in silence  lucy spoke first\\n\\ni am sure said she i have no doubt in the world\\nof your faithfully keeping this secret because you must\\nknow of what importance it is to us not to have it reach\\nhis mother for she would never approve of it i dare say\\ni shall have no fortune and i fancy she is an exceeding\\nproud woman\\n\\ni certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor\\nbut you do me no more than justice in imagining that i\\nmay be depended on  your secret is safe with me\\nbut pardon me if i express some surprise at so unnecessary\\na communication  you must at least have felt that my\\nbeing acquainted with it could not add to its safety\\n\\nas she said this she looked earnestly at lucy\\nhoping to discover something in her countenance perhaps the\\nfalsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying\\nbut lucys countenance suffered no change\\n\\ni was afraid you would think i was taking a great\\nliberty with you said she in telling you all this\\ni have not known you long to be sure personally at least\\nbut i have known you and all your family by description\\na great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if\\nyou was an old acquaintance  besides in the present case\\ni really thought some explanation was due to you after my\\nmaking such particular inquiries about edwards mother\\nand i am so unfortunate that i have not a creature whose\\nadvice i can ask  anne is the only person that knows of it\\nand she has no judgment at all indeed she does me a great\\ndeal more harm than good for i am in constant fear of her\\nbetraying me  she does not know how to hold her tongue\\nas you must perceive and i am sure i was in the greatest\\nfright in the world tother day when edwards name was\\nmentioned by sir john lest she should out with it all\\nyou cant think how much i go through in my mind from\\nit altogether  i only wonder that i am alive after what\\ni have suffered for edwards sake these last four years\\nevery thing in such suspense and uncertainty and seeing\\nhim so seldomwe can hardly meet above twice ayear\\ni am sure i wonder my heart is not quite broke\\n\\nhere she took out her handkerchief but elinor did\\nnot feel very compassionate\\n\\nsometimes continued lucy after wiping her eyes\\ni think whether it would not be better for us both\\nto break off the matter entirely  as she said this\\nshe looked directly at her companion  but then\\nat other times i have not resolution enough for it\\ni cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable\\nas i know the very mention of such a thing would do\\nand on my own account tooso dear as he is to mei dont\\nthink i could be equal to it  what would you advise\\nme to do in such a case miss dashwood  what would you\\ndo yourself\\n\\npardon me replied elinor startled by the question\\nbut i can give you no advice under such circumstances\\nyour own judgment must direct you\\n\\nto be sure continued lucy after a few minutes\\nsilence on both sides his mother must provide for him\\nsometime or other but poor edward is so cast down by it\\ndid you not think him dreadful lowspirited when he was at\\nbarton  he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple\\nto go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill\\n\\ndid he come from your uncles then when he visited us\\n\\noh yes he had been staying a fortnight with us\\ndid you think he came directly from town\\n\\nno replied elinor most feelingly sensible of\\nevery fresh circumstance in favour of lucys veracity\\ni remember he told us that he had been staying\\na fortnight with some friends near plymouth\\nshe remembered too her own surprise at the time\\nat his mentioning nothing farther of those friends\\nat his total silence with respect even to their names\\n\\ndid not you think him sadly out of spirits\\nrepeated lucy\\n\\nwe did indeed particularly so when he first arrived\\n\\ni begged him to exert himself for fear you\\nshould suspect what was the matter but it made him\\nso melancholy not being able to stay more than a\\nfortnight with us and seeing me so much affected\\npoor fellowi am afraid it is just the same with him now\\nfor he writes in wretched spirits  i heard from him just\\nbefore i left exeter taking a letter from her pocket\\nand carelessly showing the direction to elinor\\nyou know his hand i dare say a charming one it is\\nbut that is not written so well as usualhe was tired\\ni dare say for he had just filled the sheet to me as full\\nas possible\\n\\nelinor saw that it was his hand and she could doubt\\nno longer  this picture she had allowed herself to believe\\nmight have been accidentally obtained it might not have\\nbeen edwards gift but a correspondence between them\\nby letter could subsist only under a positive engagement\\ncould be authorised by nothing else for a few moments she\\nwas almost overcomeher heart sunk within her and she could\\nhardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary\\nand she struggled so resolutely against the oppression\\nof her feelings that her success was speedy and for\\nthe time complete\\n\\nwriting to each other said lucy returning the\\nletter into her pocket is the only comfort we have\\nin such long separations  yes i have one other comfort\\nin his picture but poor edward has not even that\\nif he had but my picture he says he should be easy\\ni gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at\\nlongstaple last and that was some comfort to him he said\\nbut not equal to a picture  perhaps you might notice\\nthe ring when you saw him\\n\\ni did said elinor with a composure of voice\\nunder which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond\\nany thing she had ever felt before  she was mortified\\nshocked confounded\\n\\nfortunately for her they had now reached the cottage\\nand the conversation could be continued no farther\\nafter sitting with them a few minutes the miss steeles\\nreturned to the park and elinor was then at liberty\\nto think and be wretched\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nat this point in the first and second editions volume 1 ends\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 23\\n\\n\\nhowever small elinors general dependence on\\nlucys veracity might be it was impossible for her\\non serious reflection to suspect it in the present case\\nwhere no temptation could be answerable to the folly\\nof inventing a falsehood of such a description  what lucy\\nhad asserted to be true therefore elinor could not\\ndared not longer doubt supported as it was too on every\\nside by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted\\nby nothing but her own wishes  their opportunity of\\nacquaintance in the house of mr pratt was a foundation\\nfor the rest at once indisputable and alarming and edwards\\nvisit near plymouth his melancholy state of mind\\nhis dissatisfaction at his own prospects his uncertain\\nbehaviour towards herself the intimate knowledge of the\\nmiss steeles as to norland and their family connections\\nwhich had often surprised her the picture the letter\\nthe ring formed altogether such a body of evidence\\nas overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly\\nand established as a fact which no partiality could\\nset aside his illtreatment of herselfher resentment\\nof such behaviour her indignation at having been its dupe\\nfor a short time made her feel only for herself\\nbut other ideas other considerations soon arose\\nhad edward been intentionally deceiving her  had he feigned\\na regard for her which he did not feel  was his engagement\\nto lucy an engagement of the heart  no whatever it might\\nonce have been she could not believe it such at present\\nhis affection was all her own  she could not be deceived\\nin that  her mother sisters fanny all had been\\nconscious of his regard for her at norland it was not\\nan illusion of her own vanity  he certainly loved her\\nwhat a softener of the heart was this persuasion  how much\\ncould it not tempt her to forgive  he had been blamable\\nhighly blamable in remaining at norland after he first\\nfelt her influence over him to be more than it ought\\nto be  in that he could not be defended but if he\\nhad injured her how much more had he injured himself\\nif her case were pitiable his was hopeless\\nhis imprudence had made her miserable for a while but it\\nseemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever\\nbeing otherwise  she might in time regain tranquillity\\nbut he what had he to look forward to  could he\\never be tolerably happy with lucy steele could he\\nwere his affection for herself out of the question\\nwith his integrity his delicacy and wellinformed mind\\nbe satisfied with a wife like herilliterate artful\\nand selfish\\n\\nthe youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally\\nblind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature\\nbut the four succeeding yearsyears which if rationally\\nspent give such improvement to the understanding must\\nhave opened his eyes to her defects of education\\nwhile the same period of time spent on her side\\nin inferior society and more frivolous pursuits\\nhad perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might\\nonce have given an interesting character to her beauty\\n\\nif in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself\\nhis difficulties from his mother had seemed great\\nhow much greater were they now likely to be when\\nthe object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior\\nin connections and probably inferior in fortune to herself\\nthese difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated\\nfrom lucy might not press very hard upon his patience\\nbut melancholy was the state of the person by whom the\\nexpectation of family opposition and unkindness could\\nbe felt as a relief\\n\\nas these considerations occurred to her in painful\\nsuccession she wept for him more than for herself\\nsupported by the conviction of having done nothing to\\nmerit her present unhappiness and consoled by the belief\\nthat edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem\\nshe thought she could even now under the first smart\\nof the heavy blow command herself enough to guard every\\nsuspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters\\nand so well was she able to answer her own expectations\\nthat when she joined them at dinner only two hours\\nafter she had first suffered the extinction of all her\\ndearest hopes no one would have supposed from the\\nappearance of the sisters that elinor was mourning\\nin secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever\\nfrom the object of her love and that marianne was\\ninternally dwelling on the perfections of a man of whose\\nwhole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she\\nexpected to see in every carriage which drove near their house\\n\\nthe necessity of concealing from her mother and\\nmarianne what had been entrusted in confidence to herself\\nthough it obliged her to unceasing exertion was no\\naggravation of elinors distress  on the contrary\\nit was a relief to her to be spared the communication\\nof what would give such affliction to them and to be\\nsaved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward\\nwhich would probably flow from the excess of their partial\\naffection for herself and which was more than she felt\\nequal to support\\n\\nfrom their counsel or their conversation she knew\\nshe could receive no assistance their tenderness and\\nsorrow must add to her distress while her selfcommand\\nwould neither receive encouragement from their example\\nnor from their praise  she was stronger alone\\nand her own good sense so well supported her that her\\nfirmness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness\\nas invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh\\nit was possible for them to be\\n\\nmuch as she had suffered from her first conversation\\nwith lucy on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish\\nof renewing it and this for more reasons than one\\nshe wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement\\nrepeated again she wanted more clearly to understand\\nwhat lucy really felt for edward whether there were any\\nsincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him\\nand she particularly wanted to convince lucy by her\\nreadiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness\\nin conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested\\nin it than as a friend which she very much feared\\nher involuntary agitation in their morning discourse\\nmust have left at least doubtful  that lucy was disposed\\nto be jealous of her appeared very probable it was plain\\nthat edward had always spoken highly in her praise\\nnot merely from lucys assertion but from her venturing\\nto trust her on so short a personal acquaintance\\nwith a secret so confessedly and evidently important\\nand even sir johns joking intelligence must have had\\nsome weight  but indeed while elinor remained so well\\nassured within herself of being really beloved by edward\\nit required no other consideration of probabilities\\nto make it natural that lucy should be jealous\\nand that she was so her very confidence was a proof\\nwhat other reason for the disclosure of the affair could\\nthere be but that elinor might be informed by it of lucys\\nsuperior claims on edward and be taught to avoid him\\nin future  she had little difficulty in understanding thus\\nmuch of her rivals intentions and while she was firmly\\nresolved to act by her as every principle of honour and\\nhonesty directed to combat her own affection for edward\\nand to see him as little as possible she could not deny\\nherself the comfort of endeavouring to convince lucy\\nthat her heart was unwounded  and as she could now have\\nnothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already\\nbeen told she did not mistrust her own ability of going\\nthrough a repetition of particulars with composure\\n\\nbut it was not immediately that an opportunity\\nof doing so could be commanded though lucy was as well\\ndisposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred\\nfor the weather was not often fine enough to allow\\nof their joining in a walk where they might most easily\\nseparate themselves from the others and though they\\nmet at least every other evening either at the park\\nor cottage and chiefly at the former they could\\nnot be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation\\nsuch a thought would never enter either sir john or lady\\nmiddletons head and therefore very little leisure\\nwas ever given for a general chat and none at all for\\nparticular discourse  they met for the sake of eating\\ndrinking and laughing together playing at cards\\nor consequences or any other game that was sufficiently noisy\\n\\none or two meetings of this kind had taken place\\nwithout affording elinor any chance of engaging lucy\\nin private when sir john called at the cottage one morning\\nto beg in the name of charity that they would all\\ndine with lady middleton that day as he was obliged\\nto attend the club at exeter and she would otherwise be\\nquite alone except her mother and the two miss steeles\\nelinor who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she\\nhad in view in such a party as this was likely to be\\nmore at liberty among themselves under the tranquil\\nand wellbred direction of lady middleton than when\\nher husband united them together in one noisy purpose\\nimmediately accepted the invitation margaret with her\\nmothers permission was equally compliant and marianne\\nthough always unwilling to join any of their parties\\nwas persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her\\nseclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise\\n\\nthe young ladies went and lady middleton was happily\\npreserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her\\nthe insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as elinor\\nhad expected it produced not one novelty of thought\\nor expression and nothing could be less interesting\\nthan the whole of their discourse both in the dining\\nparlour and drawing room to the latter the children\\naccompanied them and while they remained there she was\\ntoo well convinced of the impossibility of engaging lucys\\nattention to attempt it  they quitted it only with the\\nremoval of the teathings  the cardtable was then placed\\nand elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever\\nentertained a hope of finding time for conversation\\nat the park  they all rose up in preparation for a round game\\n\\ni am glad said lady middleton to lucy\\nyou are not going to finish poor little annamarias\\nbasket this evening for i am sure it must hurt your\\neyes to work filigree by candlelight  and we will make\\nthe dear little love some amends for her disappointment\\ntomorrow and then i hope she will not much mind it\\n\\nthis hint was enough lucy recollected herself instantly\\nand replied indeed you are very much mistaken\\nlady middleton i am only waiting to know whether you can\\nmake your party without me or i should have been at my\\nfiligree already  i would not disappoint the little angel\\nfor all the world and if you want me at the cardtable now\\ni am resolved to finish the basket after supper\\n\\nyou are very good i hope it wont hurt your eyes\\nwill you ring the bell for some working candles\\nmy poor little girl would be sadly disappointed i know\\nif the basket was not finished tomorrow for though i\\ntold her it certainly would not i am sure she depends\\nupon having it done\\n\\nlucy directly drew her work table near her\\nand reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness\\nwhich seemed to infer that she could taste no greater\\ndelight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child\\n\\nlady middleton proposed a rubber of casino to the others\\nno one made any objection but marianne who with her usual\\ninattention to the forms of general civility exclaimed\\nyour ladyship will have the goodness to excuse meyou\\nknow i detest cards  i shall go to the pianoforte\\ni have not touched it since it was tuned  and without\\nfarther ceremony she turned away and walked to the instrument\\n\\nlady middleton looked as if she thanked heaven\\nthat she had never made so rude a speech\\n\\nmarianne can never keep long from that instrument\\nyou know maam said elinor endeavouring to smooth\\naway the offence and i do not much wonder at it for it\\nis the very best toned pianoforte i ever heard\\n\\nthe remaining five were now to draw their cards\\n\\nperhaps continued elinor if i should happen\\nto cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele\\nin rolling her papers for her and there is so much still\\nto be done to the basket that it must be impossible\\ni think for her labour singly to finish it this evening\\ni should like the work exceedingly if she would allow\\nme a share in it\\n\\nindeed i shall be very much obliged to you\\nfor your help cried lucy for i find there is more\\nto be done to it than i thought there was and it would\\nbe a shocking thing to disappoint dear annamaria after all\\n\\noh that would be terrible indeed said miss steele\\ndear little soul how i do love her\\n\\nyou are very kind said lady middleton to elinor\\nand as you really like the work perhaps you will be\\nas well pleased not to cut in till another rubber\\nor will you take your chance now\\n\\nelinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals\\nand thus by a little of that address which marianne\\ncould never condescend to practise gained her own end\\nand pleased lady middleton at the same time  lucy made room\\nfor her with ready attention and the two fair rivals were\\nthus seated side by side at the same table and with the\\nutmost harmony engaged in forwarding the same work\\nthe pianoforte at which marianne wrapped up in her own\\nmusic and her own thoughts had by this time forgotten\\nthat any body was in the room besides herself was luckily\\nso near them that miss dashwood now judged she might safely\\nunder the shelter of its noise introduce the interesting\\nsubject without any risk of being heard at the cardtable\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 24\\n\\n\\nin a firm though cautious tone elinor thus began\\n\\ni should be undeserving of the confidence you have\\nhonoured me with if i felt no desire for its continuance\\nor no farther curiosity on its subject  i will\\nnot apologize therefore for bringing it forward again\\n\\nthank you cried lucy warmly for breaking\\nthe ice you have set my heart at ease by it for i was\\nsomehow or other afraid i had offended you by what i\\ntold you that monday\\n\\noffended me how could you suppose so believe me\\nand elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity\\nnothing could be farther from my intention than to give\\nyou such an idea  could you have a motive for the trust\\nthat was not honourable and flattering to me\\n\\nand yet i do assure you replied lucy her little\\nsharp eyes full of meaning there seemed to me to be\\na coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me\\nquite uncomfortable  i felt sure that you was angry with me\\nand have been quarrelling with myself ever since for having\\ntook such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs\\nbut i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy\\nand that you really do not blame me  if you knew what a\\nconsolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you\\nof what i am always thinking of every moment of my life\\nyour compassion would make you overlook every thing else\\ni am sure\\n\\nindeed i can easily believe that it was a very great\\nrelief to you to acknowledge your situation to me and be\\nassured that you shall never have reason to repent it\\nyour case is a very unfortunate one you seem to me to\\nbe surrounded with difficulties and you will have need\\nof all your mutual affection to support you under them\\nmr ferrars i believe is entirely dependent on his mother\\n\\nhe has only two thousand pounds of his own it would\\nbe madness to marry upon that though for my own part\\ni could give up every prospect of more without a sigh\\ni have been always used to a very small income and could\\nstruggle with any poverty for him but i love him too well\\nto be the selfish means of robbing him perhaps of all that\\nhis mother might give him if he married to please her\\nwe must wait it may be for many years  with almost every\\nother man in the world it would be an alarming prospect\\nbut edwards affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of\\ni know\\n\\nthat conviction must be every thing to you\\nand he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in yours\\nif the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed\\nas between many people and under many circumstances\\nit naturally would during a four years engagement\\nyour situation would have been pitiable indeed\\n\\nlucy here looked up but elinor was careful\\nin guarding her countenance from every expression\\nthat could give her words a suspicious tendency\\n\\nedwards love for me said lucy has been pretty\\nwell put to the test by our long very long absence\\nsince we were first engaged and it has stood the trial\\nso well that i should be unpardonable to doubt it now\\ni can safely say that he has never gave me one moments\\nalarm on that account from the first\\n\\nelinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh\\nat this assertion\\n\\nlucy went on  i am rather of a jealous temper too\\nby nature and from our different situations in life\\nfrom his being so much more in the world than me and our\\ncontinual separation i was enough inclined for suspicion\\nto have found out the truth in an instant if there had been\\nthe slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met\\nor any lowness of spirits that i could not account for\\nor if he had talked more of one lady than another\\nor seemed in any respect less happy at longstaple than he\\nused to be  i do not mean to say that i am particularly\\nobservant or quicksighted in general but in such a case\\ni am sure i could not be deceived\\n\\nall this thought elinor is very pretty\\nbut it can impose upon neither of us\\n\\nbut what said she after a short silence\\nare your views or have you none but that of waiting for\\nmrs ferrarss death which is a melancholy and shocking\\nextremityis her son determined to submit to this\\nand to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense\\nin which it may involve you rather than run the risk\\nof her displeasure for a while by owning the truth\\n\\nif we could be certain that it would be only\\nfor a while  but mrs ferrars is a very headstrong\\nproud woman and in her first fit of anger upon hearing\\nit would very likely secure every thing to robert\\nand the idea of that for edwards sake frightens away\\nall my inclination for hasty measures\\n\\nand for your own sake too or you are carrying\\nyour disinterestedness beyond reason\\n\\nlucy looked at elinor again and was silent\\n\\ndo you know mr robert ferrars asked elinor\\n\\nnot at alli never saw him but i fancy he\\nis very unlike his brothersilly and a great coxcomb\\n\\na great coxcomb repeated miss steele whose ear had\\ncaught those words by a sudden pause in mariannes music\\noh they are talking of their favourite beaux i dare say\\n\\nno sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our\\nfavourite beaux are not great coxcombs\\n\\ni can answer for it that miss dashwoods is not\\nsaid mrs jennings laughing heartily for he is one\\nof the modestest prettiest behaved young men i ever saw\\nbut as for lucy she is such a sly little creature\\nthere is no finding out who she likes\\n\\noh cried miss steele looking significantly round\\nat them i dare say lucys beau is quite as modest\\nand pretty behaved as miss dashwoods\\n\\nelinor blushed in spite of herself  lucy bit her lip\\nand looked angrily at her sister  a mutual silence took\\nplace for some time  lucy first put an end to it by saying\\nin a lower tone though marianne was then giving them\\nthe powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto\\n\\ni will honestly tell you of one scheme which has\\nlately come into my head for bringing matters to bear\\nindeed i am bound to let you into the secret for you\\nare a party concerned  i dare say you have seen enough\\nof edward to know that he would prefer the church to every\\nother profession now my plan is that he should take\\norders as soon as he can and then through your interest\\nwhich i am sure you would be kind enough to use out of\\nfriendship for him and i hope out of some regard to me\\nyour brother might be persuaded to give him norland living\\nwhich i understand is a very good one and the present\\nincumbent not likely to live a great while  that would\\nbe enough for us to marry upon and we might trust to time\\nand chance for the rest\\n\\ni should always be happy replied elinor to show\\nany mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars\\nbut do you not perceive that my interest on such an\\noccasion would be perfectly unnecessary  he is brother\\nto mrs john dashwoodthat must be recommendation enough\\nto her husband\\n\\nbut mrs john dashwood would not much approve\\nof edwards going into orders\\n\\nthen i rather suspect that my interest would\\ndo very little\\n\\nthey were again silent for many minutes  at length\\nlucy exclaimed with a deep sigh\\n\\ni believe it would be the wisest way to put an end\\nto the business at once by dissolving the engagement\\nwe seem so beset with difficulties on every side\\nthat though it would make us miserable for a time\\nwe should be happier perhaps in the end  but you will\\nnot give me your advice miss dashwood\\n\\nno answered elinor with a smile which concealed\\nvery agitated feelings on such a subject i certainly\\nwill not  you know very well that my opinion would have\\nno weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes\\n\\nindeed you wrong me replied lucy with great\\nsolemnity i know nobody of whose judgment i think\\nso highly as i do of yours and i do really believe\\nthat if you was to say to me i advise you by all means\\nto put an end to your engagement with edward ferrars\\nit will be more for the happiness of both of you\\ni should resolve upon doing it immediately\\n\\nelinor blushed for the insincerity of edwards\\nfuture wife and replied this compliment would effectually\\nfrighten me from giving any opinion on the subject\\nhad i formed one  it raises my influence much too high\\nthe power of dividing two people so tenderly attached\\nis too much for an indifferent person\\n\\ntis because you are an indifferent person said lucy\\nwith some pique and laying a particular stress on those words\\nthat your judgment might justly have such weight with me\\nif you could be supposed to be biased in any respect\\nby your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having\\n\\nelinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this\\nlest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase\\nof ease and unreserve and was even partly determined\\nnever to mention the subject again  another pause\\ntherefore of many minutes duration succeeded this speech\\nand lucy was still the first to end it\\n\\nshall you be in town this winter miss dashwood\\nsaid she with all her accustomary complacency\\n\\ncertainly not\\n\\ni am sorry for that returned the other\\nwhile her eyes brightened at the information\\nit would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there\\nbut i dare say you will go for all that  to be sure\\nyour brother and sister will ask you to come to them\\n\\nit will not be in my power to accept their invitation\\nif they do\\n\\nhow unlucky that is i had quite depended upon\\nmeeting you there  anne and me are to go the latter end\\nof january to some relations who have been wanting us to\\nvisit them these several years  but i only go for the sake\\nof seeing edward  he will be there in february otherwise\\nlondon would have no charms for me i have not spirits for it\\n\\nelinor was soon called to the cardtable by the\\nconclusion of the first rubber and the confidential\\ndiscourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end\\nto which both of them submitted without any reluctance\\nfor nothing had been said on either side to make them\\ndislike each other less than they had done before\\nand elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy\\npersuasion that edward was not only without affection\\nfor the person who was to be his wife but that he had\\nnot even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage\\nwhich sincere affection on her side would have given\\nfor selfinterest alone could induce a woman to keep a man\\nto an engagement of which she seemed so thoroughly aware\\nthat he was weary\\n\\nfrom this time the subject was never revived by elinor\\nand when entered on by lucy who seldom missed an opportunity\\nof introducing it and was particularly careful to inform\\nher confidante of her happiness whenever she received a letter\\nfrom edward it was treated by the former with calmness\\nand caution and dismissed as soon as civility would allow\\nfor she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which\\nlucy did not deserve and which were dangerous to herself\\n\\nthe visit of the miss steeles at barton park was\\nlengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied\\ntheir favour increased they could not be spared\\nsir john would not hear of their going and in spite\\nof their numerous and long arranged engagements in exeter\\nin spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill\\nthem immediately which was in full force at the end\\nof every week they were prevailed on to stay nearly two\\nmonths at the park and to assist in the due celebration\\nof that festival which requires a more than ordinary\\nshare of private balls and large dinners to proclaim\\nits importance\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 25\\n\\n\\nthough mrs jennings was in the habit of spending a large\\nportion of the year at the houses of her children and friends\\nshe was not without a settled habitation of her own\\nsince the death of her husband who had traded with success\\nin a less elegant part of the town she had resided every\\nwinter in a house in one of the streets near portman square\\ntowards this home she began on the approach of january\\nto turn her thoughts and thither she one day abruptly\\nand very unexpectedly by them asked the elder misses\\ndashwood to accompany her  elinor without observing\\nthe varying complexion of her sister and the animated look\\nwhich spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gave\\na grateful but absolute denial for both in which she\\nbelieved herself to be speaking their united inclinations\\nthe reason alleged was their determined resolution\\nof not leaving their mother at that time of the year\\nmrs jennings received the refusal with some surprise\\nand repeated her invitation immediately\\n\\noh lord i am sure your mother can spare you\\nvery well and i do beg you will favour me with\\nyour company for ive quite set my heart upon it\\ndont fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me\\nfor i shant put myself at all out of my way for you\\nit will only be sending betty by the coach and i\\nhope i can afford that  we three shall be able to go\\nvery well in my chaise and when we are in town\\nif you do not like to go wherever i do well and good\\nyou may always go with one of my daughters  i am sure\\nyour mother will not object to it for i have had such\\ngood luck in getting my own children off my hands that she\\nwill think me a very fit person to have the charge of you\\nand if i dont get one of you at least well married\\nbefore i have done with you it shall not be my fault\\ni shall speak a good word for you to all the young men\\nyou may depend upon it\\n\\ni have a notion said sir john that miss marianne\\nwould not object to such a scheme if her elder sister\\nwould come into it  it is very hard indeed that she\\nshould not have a little pleasure because miss dashwood\\ndoes not wish it  so i would advise you two to set off\\nfor town when you are tired of barton without saying\\na word to miss dashwood about it\\n\\nnay cried mrs jennings i am sure i shall be\\nmonstrous glad of miss mariannes company whether miss\\ndashwood will go or not only the more the merrier say i\\nand i thought it would be more comfortable for them to\\nbe together because if they got tired of me they might talk\\nto one another and laugh at my old ways behind my back\\nbut one or the other if not both of them i must have\\nlord bless me how do you think i can live poking by myself\\ni who have been always used till this winter to have\\ncharlotte with me  come miss marianne let us strike\\nhands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change\\nher mind by and bye why so much the better\\n\\ni thank you maam sincerely thank you said marianne\\nwith warmth your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever\\nand it would give me such happiness yes almost the greatest\\nhappiness i am capable of to be able to accept it\\nbut my mother my dearest kindest motheri feel the\\njustice of what elinor has urged and if she were to be\\nmade less happy less comfortable by our absenceoh no\\nnothing should tempt me to leave her  it should not\\nmust not be a struggle\\n\\nmrs jennings repeated her assurance that mrs dashwood\\ncould spare them perfectly well and elinor who now\\nunderstood her sister and saw to what indifference to\\nalmost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness\\nto be with willoughby again made no farther direct\\nopposition to the plan and merely referred it to her\\nmothers decision from whom however she scarcely expected\\nto receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit\\nwhich she could not approve of for marianne and which\\non her own account she had particular reasons to avoid\\nwhatever marianne was desirous of her mother would be eager\\nto promoteshe could not expect to influence the latter\\nto cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she\\nhad never been able to inspire her with distrust and she\\ndared not explain the motive of her own disinclination\\nfor going to london  that marianne fastidious as she was\\nthoroughly acquainted with mrs jennings manners\\nand invariably disgusted by them should overlook every\\ninconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever\\nmust be most wounding to her irritable feelings in her\\npursuit of one object was such a proof so strong\\nso full of the importance of that object to her as elinor\\nin spite of all that had passed was not prepared to witness\\n\\non being informed of the invitation mrs dashwood\\npersuaded that such an excursion would be productive\\nof much amusement to both her daughters and perceiving\\nthrough all her affectionate attention to herself\\nhow much the heart of marianne was in it would not hear\\nof their declining the offer upon her account insisted on\\ntheir both accepting it directly and then began to foresee\\nwith her usual cheerfulness a variety of advantages that\\nwould accrue to them all from this separation\\n\\ni am delighted with the plan she cried\\nit is exactly what i could wish  margaret and i shall\\nbe as much benefited by it as yourselves  when you\\nand the middletons are gone we shall go on so quietly\\nand happily together with our books and our music you\\nwill find margaret so improved when you come back again\\ni have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too\\nwhich may now be performed without any inconvenience\\nto any one  it is very right that you should go to town\\ni would have every young woman of your condition in life\\nacquainted with the manners and amusements of london\\nyou will be under the care of a motherly good sort\\nof woman of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt\\nand in all probability you will see your brother\\nand whatever may be his faults or the faults of his wife\\nwhen i consider whose son he is i cannot bear to have you so\\nwholly estranged from each other\\n\\nthough with your usual anxiety for our happiness\\nsaid elinor you have been obviating every impediment\\nto the present scheme which occurred to you there is\\nstill one objection which in my opinion cannot be so\\neasily removed\\n\\nmariannes countenance sunk\\n\\nand what said mrs dashwood is my dear prudent\\nelinor going to suggest  what formidable obstacle is she\\nnow to bring forward  do let me hear a word about the\\nexpense of it\\n\\nmy objection is this though i think very well of\\nmrs jenningss heart she is not a woman whose society\\ncan afford us pleasure or whose protection will give\\nus consequence\\n\\nthat is very true replied her mother but of\\nher society separately from that of other people\\nyou will scarcely have any thing at all and you will\\nalmost always appear in public with lady middleton\\n\\nif elinor is frightened away by her dislike of\\nmrs jennings said marianne at least it need not prevent\\nmy accepting her invitation  i have no such scruples\\nand i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness\\nof that kind with very little effort\\n\\nelinor could not help smiling at this display of\\nindifference towards the manners of a person to whom she\\nhad often had difficulty in persuading marianne to behave\\nwith tolerable politeness and resolved within herself\\nthat if her sister persisted in going she would\\ngo likewise as she did not think it proper that marianne\\nshould be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment\\nor that mrs jennings should be abandoned to the mercy\\nof marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours\\nto this determination she was the more easily reconciled\\nby recollecting that edward ferrars by lucys account\\nwas not to be in town before february and that\\ntheir visit without any unreasonable abridgement\\nmight be previously finished\\n\\ni will have you both go said mrs dashwood\\nthese objections are nonsensical  you will have much\\npleasure in being in london and especially in being together\\nand if elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment\\nshe would foresee it there from a variety of sources\\nshe would perhaps expect some from improving her\\nacquaintance with her sisterinlaws family\\n\\nelinor had often wished for an opportunity of\\nattempting to weaken her mothers dependence on the\\nattachment of edward and herself that the shock might\\nbe less when the whole truth were revealed and now\\non this attack though almost hopeless of success\\nshe forced herself to begin her design by saying\\nas calmly as she could i like edward ferrars very much\\nand shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest\\nof the family it is a matter of perfect indifference\\nto me whether i am ever known to them or not\\n\\nmrs dashwood smiled and said nothing\\nmarianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment and elinor\\nconjectured that she might as well have held her tongue\\n\\nafter very little farther discourse it was finally\\nsettled that the invitation should be fully accepted\\nmrs jennings received the information with a great\\ndeal of joy and many assurances of kindness and care\\nnor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her  sir john\\nwas delighted for to a man whose prevailing anxiety\\nwas the dread of being alone the acquisition of two\\nto the number of inhabitants in london was something\\neven lady middleton took the trouble of being delighted\\nwhich was putting herself rather out of her way\\nand as for the miss steeles especially lucy they had\\nnever been so happy in their lives as this intelligence\\nmade them\\n\\nelinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted\\nher wishes with less reluctance than she had expected\\nto feel  with regard to herself it was now a matter\\nof unconcern whether she went to town or not and when\\nshe saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan\\nand her sister exhilarated by it in look voice and manner\\nrestored to all her usual animation and elevated to more\\nthan her usual gaiety she could not be dissatisfied\\nwith the cause and would hardly allow herself to distrust\\nthe consequence\\n\\nmariannes joy was almost a degree beyond happiness\\nso great was the perturbation of her spirits and her\\nimpatience to be gone  her unwillingness to quit her\\nmother was her only restorative to calmness and at the\\nmoment of parting her grief on that score was excessive\\nher mothers affliction was hardly less and elinor\\nwas the only one of the three who seemed to consider\\nthe separation as any thing short of eternal\\n\\ntheir departure took place in the first week in january\\nthe middletons were to follow in about a week  the miss\\nsteeles kept their station at the park and were to quit\\nit only with the rest of the family\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 26\\n\\n\\nelinor could not find herself in the carriage with mrs jennings\\nand beginning a journey to london under her protection\\nand as her guest without wondering at her own situation\\nso short had their acquaintance with that lady been\\nso wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition\\nand so many had been her objections against such a measure\\nonly a few days before but these objections had all\\nwith that happy ardour of youth which marianne and her mother\\nequally shared been overcome or overlooked and elinor\\nin spite of every occasional doubt of willoughbys constancy\\ncould not witness the rapture of delightful expectation\\nwhich filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes\\nof marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect\\nhow cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison\\nand how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of\\nmariannes situation to have the same animating object\\nin view the same possibility of hope  a short a very\\nshort time however must now decide what willoughbys\\nintentions were in all probability he was already in town\\nmariannes eagerness to be gone declared her dependence\\non finding him there and elinor was resolved not only upon\\ngaining every new light as to his character which her\\nown observation or the intelligence of others could give her\\nbut likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister\\nwith such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was\\nand what he meant before many meetings had taken place\\nshould the result of her observations be unfavourable\\nshe was determined at all events to open the eyes\\nof her sister should it be otherwise her exertions\\nwould be of a different natureshe must then learn\\nto avoid every selfish comparison and banish every regret\\nwhich might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne\\n\\nthey were three days on their journey and mariannes\\nbehaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what\\nfuture complaisance and companionableness to mrs jennings\\nmight be expected to be  she sat in silence almost all\\nthe way wrapt in her own meditations and scarcely ever\\nvoluntarily speaking except when any object of picturesque\\nbeauty within their view drew from her an exclamation\\nof delight exclusively addressed to her sister  to atone\\nfor this conduct therefore elinor took immediate possession\\nof the post of civility which she had assigned herself\\nbehaved with the greatest attention to mrs jennings\\ntalked with her laughed with her and listened to her\\nwhenever she could and mrs jennings on her side\\ntreated them both with all possible kindness was solicitous\\non every occasion for their ease and enjoyment and only\\ndisturbed that she could not make them choose their own\\ndinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their\\npreferring salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veal cutlets\\nthey reached town by three oclock the third day glad to\\nbe released after such a journey from the confinement\\nof a carriage and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire\\n\\nthe house was handsome and handsomely fitted up\\nand the young ladies were immediately put in possession\\nof a very comfortable apartment  it had formerly\\nbeen charlottes and over the mantelpiece still hung\\na landscape in coloured silks of her performance\\nin proof of her having spent seven years at a great school\\nin town to some effect\\n\\nas dinner was not to be ready in less than two\\nhours from their arrival elinor determined to employ\\nthe interval in writing to her mother and sat down for\\nthat purpose  in a few moments marianne did the same\\ni am writing home marianne said elinor had not you\\nbetter defer your letter for a day or two\\n\\ni am not going to write to my mother\\nreplied marianne hastily and as if wishing to avoid\\nany farther inquiry  elinor said no more it immediately\\nstruck her that she must then be writing to willoughby\\nand the conclusion which as instantly followed was\\nthat however mysteriously they might wish to conduct\\nthe affair they must be engaged  this conviction\\nthough not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure\\nand she continued her letter with greater alacrity\\nmariannes was finished in a very few minutes\\nin length it could be no more than a note it was then\\nfolded up sealed and directed with eager rapidity\\nelinor thought she could distinguish a large w in\\nthe direction and no sooner was it complete than marianne\\nringing the bell requested the footman who answered it\\nto get that letter conveyed for her to the twopenny post\\nthis decided the matter at once\\n\\nher spirits still continued very high but there\\nwas a flutter in them which prevented their giving much\\npleasure to her sister and this agitation increased as\\nthe evening drew on  she could scarcely eat any dinner\\nand when they afterwards returned to the drawing room\\nseemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage\\n\\nit was a great satisfaction to elinor that mrs jennings\\nby being much engaged in her own room could see little\\nof what was passing  the tea things were brought in\\nand already had marianne been disappointed more than once\\nby a rap at a neighbouring door when a loud one was suddenly\\nheard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house\\nelinor felt secure of its announcing willoughbys approach\\nand marianne starting up moved towards the door\\nevery thing was silent this could not be borne many seconds\\nshe opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs\\nand after listening half a minute returned into the room\\nin all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\\nhim would naturally produce in the ecstasy of her\\nfeelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming\\noh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is and seemed\\nalmost ready to throw herself into his arms when colonel\\nbrandon appeared\\n\\nit was too great a shock to be borne with calmness\\nand she immediately left the room  elinor was disappointed too\\nbut at the same time her regard for colonel brandon ensured\\nhis welcome with her and she felt particularly hurt that\\na man so partial to her sister should perceive that she\\nexperienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him\\nshe instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him\\nthat he even observed marianne as she quitted the room\\nwith such astonishment and concern as hardly left him\\nthe recollection of what civility demanded towards herself\\n\\nis your sister ill said he\\n\\nelinor answered in some distress that she was\\nand then talked of headaches low spirits and over fatigues\\nand of every thing to which she could decently attribute\\nher sisters behaviour\\n\\nhe heard her with the most earnest attention\\nbut seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject\\nand began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them\\nin london making the usual inquiries about their journey\\nand the friends they had left behind\\n\\nin this calm kind of way with very little interest\\non either side they continued to talk both of them out\\nof spirits and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere\\nelinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were\\nthen in town but she was afraid of giving him pain\\nby any enquiry after his rival and at length by way\\nof saying something she asked if he had been in london\\never since she had seen him last  yes he replied\\nwith some embarrassment almost ever since i have been\\nonce or twice at delaford for a few days but it has never\\nbeen in my power to return to barton\\n\\nthis and the manner in which it was said\\nimmediately brought back to her remembrance all the\\ncircumstances of his quitting that place with the\\nuneasiness and suspicions they had caused to mrs jennings\\nand she was fearful that her question had implied\\nmuch more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt\\n\\nmrs jennings soon came in  oh colonel said she\\nwith her usual noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad\\nto see yousorry i could not come beforebeg your\\npardon but i have been forced to look about me a little\\nand settle my matters for it is a long while since i\\nhave been at home and you know one has always a world\\nof little odd things to do after one has been away for\\nany time and then i have had cartwright to settle with\\nlord i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner\\nbut pray colonel how came you to conjure out that i should\\nbe in town today\\n\\ni had the pleasure of hearing it at mr palmers\\nwhere i have been dining\\n\\noh you did well and how do they all do at their\\nhouse  how does charlotte do  i warrant you she is a fine\\nsize by this time\\n\\nmrs palmer appeared quite well and i am commissioned\\nto tell you that you will certainly see her tomorrow\\n\\nay to be sure i thought as much  well colonel\\ni have brought two young ladies with me you seethat is\\nyou see but one of them now but there is another somewhere\\nyour friend miss marianne toowhich you will not be\\nsorry to hear  i do not know what you and mr willoughby\\nwill do between you about her  ay it is a fine thing\\nto be young and handsome  well i was young once but i\\nnever was very handsomeworse luck for me  however i got\\na very good husband and i dont know what the greatest\\nbeauty can do more  ah poor man he has been dead\\nthese eight years and better  but colonel where have\\nyou been to since we parted  and how does your business\\ngo on  come come lets have no secrets among friends\\n\\nhe replied with his accustomary mildness to all\\nher inquiries but without satisfying her in any\\nelinor now began to make the tea and marianne was\\nobliged to appear again\\n\\nafter her entrance colonel brandon became\\nmore thoughtful and silent than he had been before\\nand mrs jennings could not prevail on him to stay long\\nno other visitor appeared that evening and the ladies\\nwere unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed\\n\\nmarianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits\\nand happy looks  the disappointment of the evening before\\nseemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen\\nthat day  they had not long finished their breakfast before\\nmrs palmers barouche stopped at the door and in a few\\nminutes she came laughing into the room so delighted\\nto see them all that it was hard to say whether she\\nreceived most pleasure from meeting her mother or the miss\\ndashwoods again  so surprised at their coming to town\\nthough it was what she had rather expected all along\\nso angry at their accepting her mothers invitation\\nafter having declined her own though at the same time\\nshe would never have forgiven them if they had not come\\n\\nmr palmer will be so happy to see you\\nsaid she what do you think he said when he heard\\nof your coming with mamma  i forget what it was now\\nbut it was something so droll\\n\\nafter an hour or two spent in what her mother called\\ncomfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry\\nconcerning all their acquaintance on mrs jenningss side\\nand in laughter without cause on mrs palmers it was\\nproposed by the latter that they should all accompany\\nher to some shops where she had business that morning\\nto which mrs jennings and elinor readily consented\\nas having likewise some purchases to make themselves\\nand marianne though declining it at first was induced\\nto go likewise\\n\\nwherever they went she was evidently always on\\nthe watch  in bond street especially where much of\\ntheir business lay her eyes were in constant inquiry\\nand in whatever shop the party were engaged her mind was\\nequally abstracted from every thing actually before them\\nfrom all that interested and occupied the others\\nrestless and dissatisfied every where her sister could\\nnever obtain her opinion of any article of purchase\\nhowever it might equally concern them both she received\\nno pleasure from anything was only impatient to be at\\nhome again and could with difficulty govern her vexation\\nat the tediousness of mrs palmer whose eye was caught\\nby every thing pretty expensive or new who was wild\\nto buy all could determine on none and dawdled away her\\ntime in rapture and indecision\\n\\nit was late in the morning before they returned home\\nand no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew\\neagerly up stairs and when elinor followed she found\\nher turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance\\nwhich declared that no willoughby had been there\\n\\nhas no letter been left here for me since we went out\\nsaid she to the footman who then entered with the parcels\\nshe was answered in the negative  are you quite sure\\nof it she replied  are you certain that no servant\\nno porter has left any letter or note\\n\\nthe man replied that none had\\n\\nhow very odd said she in a low and disappointed\\nvoice as she turned away to the window\\n\\nhow odd indeed repeated elinor within herself\\nregarding her sister with uneasiness  if she had not\\nknown him to be in town she would not have written to him\\nas she did she would have written to combe magna\\nand if he is in town how odd that he should neither\\ncome nor write  oh my dear mother you must be wrong\\nin permitting an engagement between a daughter so young\\na man so little known to be carried on in so doubtful\\nso mysterious a manner  i long to inquire and how will my\\ninterference be borne\\n\\nshe determined after some consideration that if\\nappearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they\\nnow were she would represent in the strongest manner\\nto her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the\\naffair\\n\\nmrs palmer and two elderly ladies of mrs jenningss\\nintimate acquaintance whom she had met and invited\\nin the morning dined with them  the former left them\\nsoon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements\\nand elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table\\nfor the others  marianne was of no use on these occasions\\nas she would never learn the game but though her time\\nwas therefore at her own disposal the evening was by no\\nmeans more productive of pleasure to her than to elinor\\nfor it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the\\npain of disappointment  she sometimes endeavoured for a\\nfew minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside\\nand she returned to the more interesting employment\\nof walking backwards and forwards across the room\\npausing for a moment whenever she came to the window\\nin hopes of distinguishing the longexpected rap\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 27\\n\\n\\nif this open weather holds much longer said mrs jennings\\nwhen they met at breakfast the following morning\\nsir john will not like leaving barton next week\\ntis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a days pleasure\\npoor souls  i always pity them when they do they seem\\nto take it so much to heart\\n\\nthat is true cried marianne in a cheerful voice\\nand walking to the window as she spoke to examine the day\\ni had not thought of that  this weather will keep many\\nsportsmen in the country\\n\\nit was a lucky recollection all her good spirits were\\nrestored by it  it is charming weather for them indeed\\nshe continued as she sat down to the breakfast table\\nwith a happy countenance  how much they must enjoy\\nit but with a little return of anxiety it cannot\\nbe expected to last long  at this time of the year\\nand after such a series of rain we shall certainly\\nhave very little more of it  frosts will soon set in\\nand in all probability with severity  in another day\\nor two perhaps this extreme mildness can hardly last\\nlongernay perhaps it may freeze tonight\\n\\nat any rate said elinor wishing to prevent\\nmrs jennings from seeing her sisters thoughts as clearly\\nas she did i dare say we shall have sir john and lady\\nmiddleton in town by the end of next week\\n\\nay my dear ill warrant you we do  mary always\\nhas her own way\\n\\nand now silently conjectured elinor she will\\nwrite to combe by this days post\\n\\nbut if she did the letter was written and sent away\\nwith a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain\\nthe fact  whatever the truth of it might be and far\\nas elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it\\nyet while she saw marianne in spirits she could not be\\nvery uncomfortable herself  and marianne was in spirits\\nhappy in the mildness of the weather and still happier\\nin her expectation of a frost\\n\\nthe morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at\\nthe houses of mrs jenningss acquaintance to inform\\nthem of her being in town and marianne was all the time\\nbusy in observing the direction of the wind watching the\\nvariations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air\\n\\ndont you find it colder than it was in the morning\\nelinor there seems to me a very decided difference\\ni can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff  it was\\nnot so yesterday i think  the clouds seem parting too\\nthe sun will be out in a moment and we shall have a\\nclear afternoon\\n\\nelinor was alternately diverted and pained\\nbut marianne persevered and saw every night in the\\nbrightness of the fire and every morning in the appearance\\nof the atmosphere the certain symptoms of approaching frost\\n\\nthe miss dashwoods had no greater reason to be\\ndissatisfied with mrs jenningss style of living and set\\nof acquaintance than with her behaviour to themselves\\nwhich was invariably kind  every thing in her household\\narrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan\\nand excepting a few old city friends whom to lady\\nmiddletons regret she had never dropped she visited\\nno one to whom an introduction could at all discompose\\nthe feelings of her young companions  pleased to find\\nherself more comfortably situated in that particular than\\nshe had expected elinor was very willing to compound\\nfor the want of much real enjoyment from any of their\\nevening parties which whether at home or abroad\\nformed only for cards could have little to amuse her\\n\\ncolonel brandon who had a general invitation\\nto the house was with them almost every day he came\\nto look at marianne and talk to elinor who often derived\\nmore satisfaction from conversing with him than from any\\nother daily occurrence but who saw at the same time\\nwith much concern his continued regard for her sister\\nshe feared it was a strengthening regard  it grieved her\\nto see the earnestness with which he often watched marianne\\nand his spirits were certainly worse than when at barton\\n\\nabout a week after their arrival it became\\ncertain that willoughby was also arrived  his card\\nwas on the table when they came in from the mornings drive\\n\\ngood god cried marianne he has been here while\\nwe were out  elinor rejoiced to be assured of his\\nbeing in london now ventured to say depend upon it\\nhe will call again tomorrow  but marianne seemed\\nhardly to hear her and on mrs jennings entrance\\nescaped with the precious card\\n\\nthis event while it raised the spirits of elinor\\nrestored to those of her sister all and more than all\\ntheir former agitation  from this moment her mind was\\nnever quiet the expectation of seeing him every hour\\nof the day made her unfit for any thing  she insisted\\non being left behind the next morning when the others\\nwent out\\n\\nelinors thoughts were full of what might be passing\\nin berkeley street during their absence but a moments\\nglance at her sister when they returned was enough to\\ninform her that willoughby had paid no second visit there\\na note was just then brought in and laid on the table\\n\\nfor me cried marianne stepping hastily forward\\n\\nno maam for my mistress\\n\\nbut marianne not convinced took it instantly up\\n\\nit is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking\\n\\nyou are expecting a letter then said elinor\\nunable to be longer silent\\n\\nyes a littlenot much\\n\\nafter a short pause  you have no confidence\\nin me marianne\\n\\nnay elinor this reproach from youyou who have\\nconfidence in no one\\n\\nme returned elinor in some confusion indeed\\nmarianne i have nothing to tell\\n\\nnor i answered marianne with energy our situations\\nthen are alike  we have neither of us any thing to tell\\nyou because you do not communicate and i because\\ni conceal nothing\\n\\nelinor distressed by this charge of reserve in herself\\nwhich she was not at liberty to do away knew not how\\nunder such circumstances to press for greater openness\\nin marianne\\n\\nmrs jennings soon appeared and the note being\\ngiven her she read it aloud  it was from lady middleton\\nannouncing their arrival in conduit street the night before\\nand requesting the company of her mother and cousins\\nthe following evening  business on sir johns part\\nand a violent cold on her own prevented their calling\\nin berkeley street  the invitation was accepted\\nbut when the hour of appointment drew near necessary as\\nit was in common civility to mrs jennings that they\\nshould both attend her on such a visit elinor had some\\ndifficulty in persuading her sister to go for still\\nshe had seen nothing of willoughby and therefore was\\nnot more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling\\nto run the risk of his calling again in her absence\\n\\nelinor found when the evening was over\\nthat disposition is not materially altered by a change\\nof abode for although scarcely settled in town\\nsir john had contrived to collect around him nearly twenty\\nyoung people and to amuse them with a ball  this was\\nan affair however of which lady middleton did not approve\\nin the country an unpremeditated dance was very allowable\\nbut in london where the reputation of elegance was more\\nimportant and less easily attained it was risking too much\\nfor the gratification of a few girls to have it known that\\nlady middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple\\nwith two violins and a mere sideboard collation\\n\\nmr and mrs palmer were of the party from the former\\nwhom they had not seen before since their arrival in town\\nas he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention\\nto his motherinlaw and therefore never came near her\\nthey received no mark of recognition on their entrance\\nhe looked at them slightly without seeming to know\\nwho they were and merely nodded to mrs jennings from\\nthe other side of the room  marianne gave one glance\\nround the apartment as she entered it was enoughhe\\nwas not thereand she sat down equally illdisposed\\nto receive or communicate pleasure  after they had been\\nassembled about an hour mr palmer sauntered towards\\nthe miss dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them\\nin town though colonel brandon had been first informed\\nof their arrival at his house and he had himself said\\nsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come\\n\\ni thought you were both in devonshire said he\\n\\ndid you replied elinor\\n\\nwhen do you go back again\\n\\ni do not know and thus ended their discourse\\n\\nnever had marianne been so unwilling to dance\\nin her life as she was that evening and never so much\\nfatigued by the exercise  she complained of it\\nas they returned to berkeley street\\n\\naye aye said mrs jennings we know the reason\\nof all that very well if a certain person who shall\\nbe nameless had been there you would not have been a\\nbit tired and to say the truth it was not very pretty\\nof him not to give you the meeting when he was invited\\n\\ninvited cried marianne\\n\\nso my daughter middleton told me for it seems sir\\njohn met him somewhere in the street this morning\\nmarianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt\\nimpatient in this situation to be doing something\\nthat might lead to her sisters relief elinor resolved\\nto write the next morning to her mother and hoped\\nby awakening her fears for the health of marianne\\nto procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed\\nand she was still more eagerly bent on this measure\\nby perceiving after breakfast on the morrow that marianne\\nwas again writing to willoughby for she could not suppose\\nit to be to any other person\\n\\nabout the middle of the day mrs jennings went out by\\nherself on business and elinor began her letter directly\\nwhile marianne too restless for employment too anxious\\nfor conversation walked from one window to the other\\nor sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation\\nelinor was very earnest in her application to her mother\\nrelating all that had passed her suspicions of\\nwilloughbys inconstancy urging her by every plea\\nof duty and affection to demand from marianne an account\\nof her real situation with respect to him\\n\\nher letter was scarcely finished when a rap\\nforetold a visitor and colonel brandon was announced\\nmarianne who had seen him from the window and who hated\\ncompany of any kind left the room before he entered it\\nhe looked more than usually grave and though expressing\\nsatisfaction at finding miss dashwood alone as if he\\nhad somewhat in particular to tell her sat for some\\ntime without saying a word  elinor persuaded that he\\nhad some communication to make in which her sister\\nwas concerned impatiently expected its opening\\nit was not the first time of her feeling the same kind\\nof conviction for more than once before beginning with\\nthe observation of your sister looks unwell today\\nor your sister seems out of spirits he had appeared\\non the point either of disclosing or of inquiring\\nsomething particular about her  after a pause of several\\nminutes their silence was broken by his asking her\\nin a voice of some agitation when he was to congratulate\\nher on the acquisition of a brother  elinor was not\\nprepared for such a question and having no answer ready\\nwas obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient\\nof asking what he meant  he tried to smile as he replied\\nyour sisters engagement to mr willoughby is very generally\\nknown\\n\\nit cannot be generally known returned elinor\\nfor her own family do not know it\\n\\nhe looked surprised and said i beg your pardon\\ni am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent but i had not\\nsupposed any secrecy intended as they openly correspond\\nand their marriage is universally talked of\\n\\nhow can that be by whom can you have heard\\nit mentioned\\n\\nby manyby some of whom you know nothing by others\\nwith whom you are most intimate mrs jennings mrs palmer\\nand the middletons  but still i might not have believed it\\nfor where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to\\nbe convinced it will always find something to support\\nits doubts if i had not when the servant let me in today\\naccidentally seen a letter in his hand directed to\\nmr willoughby in your sisters writing  i came to inquire\\nbut i was convinced before i could ask the question\\nis every thing finally settled  is it impossible to\\nbut i have no right and i could have no chance of succeeding\\nexcuse me miss dashwood  i believe i have been wrong\\nin saying so much but i hardly know what to do and on\\nyour prudence i have the strongest dependence  tell me\\nthat it is all absolutely resolved on that any attempt\\nthat in short concealment if concealment be possible\\nis all that remains\\n\\nthese words which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal\\nof his love for her sister affected her very much\\nshe was not immediately able to say anything and even\\nwhen her spirits were recovered she debated for a short\\ntime on the answer it would be most proper to give\\nthe real state of things between willoughby and her sister\\nwas so little known to herself that in endeavouring\\nto explain it she might be as liable to say too much\\nas too little  yet as she was convinced that mariannes\\naffection for willoughby could leave no hope of colonel\\nbrandons success whatever the event of that affection\\nmight be and at the same time wished to shield her conduct\\nfrom censure she thought it most prudent and kind\\nafter some consideration to say more than she really knew\\nor believed  she acknowledged therefore that though\\nshe had never been informed by themselves of the terms\\non which they stood with each other of their mutual\\naffection she had no doubt and of their correspondence\\nshe was not astonished to hear\\n\\nhe listened to her with silent attention and on\\nher ceasing to speak rose directly from his seat\\nand after saying in a voice of emotion to your sister\\ni wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he\\nmay endeavour to deserve hertook leave and went away\\n\\nelinor derived no comfortable feelings from this\\nconversation to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on\\nother points she was left on the contrary with a\\nmelancholy impression of colonel brandons unhappiness\\nand was prevented even from wishing it removed\\nby her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 28\\n\\n\\nnothing occurred during the next three or four days\\nto make elinor regret what she had done in applying\\nto her mother for willoughby neither came nor wrote\\nthey were engaged about the end of that time to attend\\nlady middleton to a party from which mrs jennings was\\nkept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter\\nand for this party marianne wholly dispirited\\ncareless of her appearance and seeming equally indifferent\\nwhether she went or staid prepared without one look\\nof hope or one expression of pleasure  she sat by the\\ndrawingroom fire after tea till the moment of lady\\nmiddletons arrival without once stirring from her seat\\nor altering her attitude lost in her own thoughts\\nand insensible of her sisters presence and when at\\nlast they were told that lady middleton waited for them\\nat the door she started as if she had forgotten that\\nany one was expected\\n\\nthey arrived in due time at the place of destination\\nand as soon as the string of carriages before them\\nwould allow alighted ascended the stairs heard their\\nnames announced from one landingplace to another in an\\naudible voice and entered a room splendidly lit up\\nquite full of company and insufferably hot  when they had\\npaid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady\\nof the house they were permitted to mingle in the crowd\\nand take their share of the heat and inconvenience to\\nwhich their arrival must necessarily add  after some time\\nspent in saying little or doing less lady middleton sat\\ndown to cassino and as marianne was not in spirits for\\nmoving about she and elinor luckily succeeding to chairs\\nplaced themselves at no great distance from the table\\n\\nthey had not remained in this manner long before elinor\\nperceived willoughby standing within a few yards\\nof them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable\\nlooking young woman  she soon caught his eye and he\\nimmediately bowed but without attempting to speak to her\\nor to approach marianne though he could not but see her\\nand then continued his discourse with the same lady\\nelinor turned involuntarily to marianne to see whether\\nit could be unobserved by her  at that moment she first\\nperceived him and her whole countenance glowing with\\nsudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly\\nhad not her sister caught hold of her\\n\\ngood heavens she exclaimed he is therehe\\nis thereoh why does he not look at me why cannot\\ni speak to him\\n\\npray pray be composed cried elinor and do\\nnot betray what you feel to every body present\\nperhaps he has not observed you yet\\n\\nthis however was more than she could believe herself\\nand to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond\\nthe reach of marianne it was beyond her wish  she sat\\nin an agony of impatience which affected every feature\\n\\nat last he turned round again and regarded them both\\nshe started up and pronouncing his name in a tone\\nof affection held out her hand to him  he approached\\nand addressing himself rather to elinor than marianne\\nas if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to\\nobserve her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after\\nmrs dashwood and asked how long they had been in town\\nelinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address\\nand was unable to say a word  but the feelings of her sister\\nwere instantly expressed  her face was crimsoned over\\nand she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion\\ngood god willoughby what is the meaning of this\\nhave you not received my letters  will you not shake\\nhands with me\\n\\nhe could not then avoid it but her touch seemed\\npainful to him and he held her hand only for a moment\\nduring all this time he was evidently struggling for composure\\nelinor watched his countenance and saw its expression\\nbecoming more tranquil  after a moments pause he spoke\\nwith calmness\\n\\ni did myself the honour of calling in berkeley\\nstreet last tuesday and very much regretted that i was\\nnot fortunate enough to find yourselves and mrs jennings\\nat home  my card was not lost i hope\\n\\nbut have you not received my notes cried marianne\\nin the wildest anxiety  here is some mistake i am\\nsuresome dreadful mistake  what can be the meaning\\nof it  tell me willoughby for heavens sake tell me\\nwhat is the matter\\n\\nhe made no reply his complexion changed and all his\\nembarrassment returned but as if on catching the eye\\nof the young lady with whom he had been previously talking\\nhe felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered\\nhimself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure\\nof receiving the information of your arrival in town\\nwhich you were so good as to send me turned hastily away\\nwith a slight bow and joined his friend\\n\\nmarianne now looking dreadfully white and unable\\nto stand sunk into her chair and elinor expecting every\\nmoment to see her faint tried to screen her from the\\nobservation of others while reviving her with lavender water\\n\\ngo to him elinor she cried as soon as she\\ncould speak and force him to come to me  tell him\\ni must see him againmust speak to him instantly\\ni cannot resti shall not have a moments peace till this\\nis explainedsome dreadful misapprehension or other\\noh go to him this moment\\n\\nhow can that be done no my dearest marianne\\nyou must wait  this is not the place for explanations\\nwait only till tomorrow\\n\\nwith difficulty however could she prevent her\\nfrom following him herself and to persuade her to check\\nher agitation to wait at least with the appearance\\nof composure till she might speak to him with more privacy\\nand more effect was impossible for marianne continued\\nincessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery\\nof her feelings by exclamations of wretchedness\\nin a short time elinor saw willoughby quit the room by the\\ndoor towards the staircase and telling marianne that he\\nwas gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again\\nthat evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm\\nshe instantly begged her sister would entreat lady\\nmiddleton to take them home as she was too miserable\\nto stay a minute longer\\n\\nlady middleton though in the middle of a rubber\\non being informed that marianne was unwell was too\\npolite to object for a moment to her wish of going away\\nand making over her cards to a friend they departed\\nas soon the carriage could be found  scarcely a word\\nwas spoken during their return to berkeley street\\nmarianne was in a silent agony too much oppressed even\\nfor tears but as mrs jennings was luckily not come home\\nthey could go directly to their own room where hartshorn\\nrestored her a little to herself  she was soon undressed\\nand in bed and as she seemed desirous of being alone\\nher sister then left her and while she waited the return\\nof mrs jennings had leisure enough for thinking over\\nthe past\\n\\nthat some kind of engagement had subsisted\\nbetween willoughby and marianne she could not doubt\\nand that willoughby was weary of it seemed equally clear\\nfor however marianne might still feed her own wishes\\nshe could not attribute such behaviour to mistake\\nor misapprehension of any kind  nothing but a thorough\\nchange of sentiment could account for it  her indignation\\nwould have been still stronger than it was had she\\nnot witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak\\na consciousness of his own misconduct and prevented\\nher from believing him so unprincipled as to have been\\nsporting with the affections of her sister from the first\\nwithout any design that would bear investigation\\nabsence might have weakened his regard and convenience\\nmight have determined him to overcome it but that such\\na regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself\\nto doubt\\n\\nas for marianne on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting\\nmust already have given her and on those still more\\nsevere which might await her in its probable consequence\\nshe could not reflect without the deepest concern\\nher own situation gained in the comparison for while she\\ncould esteem edward as much as ever however they might be\\ndivided in future her mind might be always supported\\nbut every circumstance that could embitter such an evil\\nseemed uniting to heighten the misery of marianne\\nin a final separation from willoughbyin an immediate\\nand irreconcilable rupture with him\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 29\\n\\n\\nbefore the housemaid had lit their fire the next day\\nor the sun gained any power over a cold gloomy morning\\nin january marianne only half dressed was kneeling\\nagainst one of the windowseats for the sake of all\\nthe little light she could command from it and writing\\nas fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her\\nin this situation elinor roused from sleep by her agitation\\nand sobs first perceived her and after observing her\\nfor a few moments with silent anxiety said in a tone\\nof the most considerate gentleness\\n\\nmarianne may i ask\\n\\nno elinor she replied ask nothing you will\\nsoon know all\\n\\nthe sort of desperate calmness with which this was said\\nlasted no longer than while she spoke and was immediately\\nfollowed by a return of the same excessive affliction\\nit was some minutes before she could go on with her letter\\nand the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her\\nat intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough of her\\nfeeling how more than probable it was that she was writing\\nfor the last time to willoughby\\n\\nelinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention\\nin her power and she would have tried to sooth and\\ntranquilize her still more had not marianne entreated her\\nwith all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability\\nnot to speak to her for the world  in such circumstances\\nit was better for both that they should not be long together\\nand the restless state of mariannes mind not only prevented\\nher from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed\\nbut requiring at once solitude and continual change of place\\nmade her wander about the house till breakfast time avoiding\\nthe sight of every body\\n\\nat breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat\\nany thing and elinors attention was then all employed\\nnot in urging her not in pitying her nor in appearing\\nto regard her but in endeavouring to engage mrs jennings\\nnotice entirely to herself\\n\\nas this was a favourite meal with mrs jennings\\nit lasted a considerable time and they were just setting\\nthemselves after it round the common working table when a\\nletter was delivered to marianne which she eagerly caught\\nfrom the servant and turning of a deathlike paleness\\ninstantly ran out of the room  elinor who saw as plainly\\nby this as if she had seen the direction that it must\\ncome from willoughby felt immediately such a sickness\\nat heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head\\nand sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it\\nimpossible to escape mrs jennings notice  that good lady\\nhowever saw only that marianne had received a letter\\nfrom willoughby which appeared to her a very good joke\\nand which she treated accordingly by hoping with a laugh\\nthat she would find it to her liking  of elinors distress\\nshe was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted\\nfor her rug to see any thing at all and calmly continuing\\nher talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said\\n\\nupon my word i never saw a young woman so\\ndesperately in love in my life  my girls were nothing\\nto her and yet they used to be foolish enough but as\\nfor miss marianne she is quite an altered creature\\ni hope from the bottom of my heart he wont keep her\\nwaiting much longer for it is quite grievous to see her\\nlook so ill and forlorn  pray when are they to be married\\n\\nelinor though never less disposed to speak than at\\nthat moment obliged herself to answer such an attack\\nas this and therefore trying to smile replied and have\\nyou really maam talked yourself into a persuasion\\nof my sisters being engaged to mr willoughby  i thought\\nit had been only a joke but so serious a question seems\\nto imply more and i must beg therefore that you will not\\ndeceive yourself any longer  i do assure you that nothing\\nwould surprise me more than to hear of their being going\\nto be married\\n\\nfor shame for shame miss dashwood how can you\\ntalk so  dont we all know that it must be a match that\\nthey were over head and ears in love with each other from\\nthe first moment they met  did not i see them together\\nin devonshire every day and all day long and did not i\\nknow that your sister came to town with me on purpose\\nto buy wedding clothes  come come this wont do\\nbecause you are so sly about it yourself you think nobody\\nelse has any senses but it is no such thing i can tell you\\nfor it has been known all over town this ever so long\\ni tell every body of it and so does charlotte\\n\\nindeed maam said elinor very seriously\\nyou are mistaken  indeed you are doing a very unkind thing\\nin spreading the report and you will find that you have\\nthough you will not believe me now\\n\\nmrs jennings laughed again but elinor had not\\nspirits to say more and eager at all events to know\\nwhat willoughby had written hurried away to their room\\nwhere on opening the door she saw marianne stretched on\\nthe bed almost choked by grief one letter in her hand\\nand two or three others laying by her  elinor drew near\\nbut without saying a word and seating herself on the bed\\ntook her hand kissed her affectionately several times\\nand then gave way to a burst of tears which at first\\nwas scarcely less violent than mariannes the latter\\nthough unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness\\nof this behaviour and after some time thus spent in\\njoint affliction she put all the letters into elinors hands\\nand then covering her face with her handkerchief\\nalmost screamed with agony  elinor who knew that such grief\\nshocking as it was to witness it must have its course\\nwatched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat\\nspent itself and then turning eagerly to willoughbys letter\\nread as follows\\n\\n                              bond street january\\n     my dear madam\\n\\n     i have just had the honour of receiving your\\n     letter for which i beg to return my sincere\\n

esteem for your\\n     whole family is very sincere but if i have been so\\n     unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than\\n     i felt or meant to express i shall reproach myself\\n     for not having been more guarded in my professions\\n     of that esteem  that i should ever have meant more\\n     you will allow to be impossible when you understand\\n     that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere\\n     and it will not be many weeks i believe before\\n     this engagement is fulfilled  it is with great\\n     regret that i obey your commands in returning the\\n

aware\\nbefore she began it that it must bring a confession\\nof his inconstancy and confirm their separation for ever\\nshe was not aware that such language could be suffered\\nto announce it nor could she have supposed willoughby\\ncapable of departing so far from the appearance of every\\nhonourable and delicate feelingso far from the common\\ndecorum of a gentleman as to send a letter so impudently\\ncruel a letter which instead of bringing with his desire\\nof a release any professions of regret acknowledged no\\nbreach of faith denied all peculiar affection whatever\\na letter of which every line was an insult and which\\nproclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy\\n\\nshe paused over it for some time with indignant\\nastonishment then read it again and again but every\\nperusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man\\nand so bitter were her feelings against him that she\\ndared not trust herself to speak lest she might wound\\nmarianne still deeper by treating their disengagement\\nnot as a loss to her of any possible good but as an\\nescape from the worst and most irremediable of all\\nevils a connection for life with an unprincipled man\\nas a deliverance the most real a blessing the most important\\n\\nin her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter\\non the depravity of that mind which could dictate it\\nand probably on the very different mind of a very different\\nperson who had no other connection whatever with the affair\\nthan what her heart gave him with every thing that passed\\nelinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister\\nforgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread\\nand so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room\\nthat when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door\\nshe went to the window to see who could be coming so\\nunreasonably early she was all astonishment to perceive\\nmrs jenningss chariot which she knew had not been\\nordered till one  determined not to quit marianne\\nthough hopeless of contributing at present to her ease\\nshe hurried away to excuse herself from attending\\nmrs jennings on account of her sister being indisposed\\nmrs jennings with a thoroughly goodhumoured concern\\nfor its cause admitted the excuse most readily and elinor\\nafter seeing her safe off returned to marianne whom she\\nfound attempting to rise from the bed and whom she reached\\njust in time to prevent her from falling on the floor\\nfaint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food\\nfor it was many days since she had any appetite and many\\nnights since she had really slept and now when her\\nmind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense\\nthe consequence of all this was felt in an aching head\\na weakened stomach and a general nervous faintness\\na glass of wine which elinor procured for her directly\\nmade her more comfortable and she was at last able to express\\nsome sense of her kindness by saying\\n\\npoor elinor how unhappy i make you\\n\\ni only wish replied her sister there were\\nany thing i could do which might be of comfort to you\\n\\nthis as every thing else would have been\\nwas too much for marianne who could only

adieu\\n\\n                                             md\\n\\nher second note which had been written on the morning\\nafter the dance at the middletons was in these words\\n\\n     i cannot express my disappointment in having\\n     missed you the day before yesterday nor my astonishment\\n     at not having received any answer to a note which\\n     i sent you above a week ago  i have been expecting\\n     to hear from you and still more to see you every\\n     hour of the day  pray call again as soon as possible\\n     and explain the reason of my having expected this\\n     in vain  you had better come earlier another time\\n     because we are generally out by one  we were last\\n     night at lady middletons where there was a dance\\n     i have been told that you were asked to be of the\\n     party  but could it be so  you must be very much\\n     altered indeed since we parted if that could be\\n     the case and you not there  but i will not suppose\\n     this possible and i hope very soon to receive your\\n     personal assurance of its being otherwise\\n\\n                                            md\\n\\nthe contents of her last note to him were these\\n\\n     what am i to imagine willoughby by your\\n     behaviour last night  again i demand an explanation\\n     of it  i was prepared to meet you with the pleasure\\n     which our separation naturally produced with the\\n     familiarity which our intimacy at barton appeared\\n     to me to justify  i was repulsed indeed i have\\n     passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse\\n     a conduct which can scarcely be called less than\\n     insulting but though i have not yet been able to\\n     form any reasonable apology for your behaviour\\n     i am perfectly ready to hear your justification of\\n     it  you have perhaps been misinformed or purposely\\n     deceived in something concerning me which may have\\n     lowered me in your opinion  tell me what it is\\n     explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall\\n     be satisfied in being able to satisfy you  it\\n     would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill\\n     of you but if i am to do it if i am to learn that\\n     you are not what we have hitherto believed you that\\n     your regard for us all was insincere that your\\n     behaviour to me was intended only to deceive let\\n     it be told as soon as possible  my feelings are at\\n     present in a state of dreadful indecision i wish\\n     to acquit you but certainty on either side will be\\n     ease to what i now suffer  if your sentiments are\\n     no longer what they were you will return my notes\\n     and the lock of my hair which is in your possession\\n\\n                                             md\\n\\nthat such letters so full of affection and confidence\\ncould have been so answered elinor for willoughbys sake\\nwould have been unwilling to believe  but her condemnation\\nof him did not blind her to the impropriety of their\\nhaving been written at all and she was silently grieving\\nover the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited\\nproofs of tenderness not warranted by anything preceding\\nand most severely condemned by the event when marianne\\nperceiving that she had finished the letters observed to\\nher that they contained nothing but what any one would\\nhave written in the same situation\\n\\ni felt myself she added to be as solemnly\\nengaged to him as if the strictest legal covenant\\nhad bound us to each other\\n\\ni can believe it said elinor but unfortunately\\nhe did not feel the same\\n\\nhe did feel the same elinorfor weeks and weeks he\\nfelt it  i know he did  whatever may have changed him now and\\nnothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done\\nit i was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish\\nthis lock of hair which now he can so readily give up\\nwas begged of me with the most earnest supplication\\nhad you seen his look his manner had you heard his voice\\nat that moment  have you forgot the last evening of our\\nbeing together at barton  the morning that we parted\\ntoo  when he told me that it might be many weeks before\\nwe met againhis distresscan i ever forget his distress\\n\\nfor a moment or two she could say no more\\nbut when this emotion had passed away she added\\nin a firmer tone\\n\\nelinor i have been cruelly used but not by willoughby\\n\\ndearest marianne who but himself  by whom can he\\nhave been instigated\\n\\nby all the world rather than by his own heart\\ni could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance\\nleagued together to ruin me in his opinion than believe\\nhis nature capable of such cruelty  this woman of whom he\\nwriteswhoever she beor any one in short but your own\\ndear self mama and edward may have been so barbarous\\nto bely me  beyond you three is there a creature\\nin the world whom i would not rather suspect of evil\\nthan willoughby whose heart i know so well\\n\\nelinor would not contend and only replied\\nwhoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them\\nbe cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister\\nby seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own\\ninnocence and good intentions supports your spirits\\nit is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists\\nsuch malevolence\\n\\nno no

thoughtfully from the fire to the window\\nfrom the window to the fire without knowing that she\\nreceived warmth from one or discerning objects through\\nthe other and marianne seated at the foot of the bed\\nwith her head leaning against one of its posts\\nagain took up willoughbys letter and after shuddering\\nover every sentence exclaimed\\n\\nit is too much oh willoughby willoughby could this\\nbe yours  cruel cruelnothing can acquit you  elinor\\nnothing can  whatever he might have heard against me\\nought he not to have suspended his belief ought he not to\\nhave told me of it to

those words\\noh barbarously insolentelinor can he be justified\\n\\nno marianne in no possible way\\n\\nand yet this womanwho knows what her art may\\nhave beenhow long it may have been premeditated\\nand how deeply contrived by herwho is shewho can\\nshe bewhom did i ever hear him talk of as young and\\nattractive among his female acquaintanceoh no one\\nno onehe talked to me only

marianne\\n\\nyes why should i stay here i came only for\\nwilloughbys sakeand now who cares for me who regards me\\n\\nit would be impossible to go tomorrow we owe\\nmrs jennings much more than civility and civility of\\nthe commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that\\n\\nwell then another day or two perhaps but i cannot\\nstay here long i cannot stay to endure the questions\\nand remarks of all these people  the middletons and\\npalmershow am i to bear their pity  the pity of such\\na woman as lady middleton  oh what would he say to that\\n\\nelinor advised her to lie down again and for a\\nmoment she did so but no attitude could give her ease\\nand in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one\\nposture to another till growing more and more hysterical\\nher sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all\\nand for some time was fearful of being constrained to call\\nfor assistance  some lavender drops however which she\\nwas at length persuaded to take were of use and from\\nthat time till mrs jennings returned she continued\\non the bed quiet and motionless\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 30\\n\\n\\nmrs jennings came immediately to their room on her return\\nand without waiting to have her request of admittance answered\\nopened the door and walked in with a look of real concern\\n\\nhow do you do my dearsaid she in a voice of great\\ncompassion to marianne who turned away her face without\\nattempting to answer\\n\\nhow is she miss dashwoodpoor thing she looks very bad\\nno wonder  ay it is but too true  he is to be married\\nvery soona goodfornothing fellow  i have no patience\\nwith him  mrs taylor told me of it half an hour ago\\nand she was told it by a particular friend of miss\\ngrey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it\\nand i was almost ready to sink as it was  well said i\\nall i can say is that if this be true he has used\\na young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill and i\\nwish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out\\nand so i shall always say my dear you may depend on it\\ni have no notion of mens going on in this way and if ever\\ni meet him again i will give him such a dressing as he\\nhas not had this many a day  but there is one comfort\\nmy dear miss marianne he is not the only young man\\nin the world worth having and with your pretty face\\nyou will never want admirers  well poor thing  i wont\\ndisturb her any longer for she had better have her cry\\nout at once and have done with  the parrys and sandersons\\nluckily are coming tonight you know and that will amuse her\\n\\nshe then went away walking on tiptoe out of the room\\nas if she supposed her young friends affliction could\\nbe increased by noise\\n\\nmarianne to the surprise of her sister\\ndetermined on dining with them  elinor even advised\\nher against it  but no she would go down she could\\nbear it very well and the bustle about her would\\nbe less  elinor pleased to have her governed for a\\nmoment by such a motive though believing it hardly\\npossible that she could sit out the dinner said no more\\nand adjusting her dress for her as well as she could\\nwhile marianne still remained on the bed was ready\\nto assist her into the dining room as soon as they were\\nsummoned to it\\n\\nwhen there though looking most wretchedly\\nshe ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected\\nhad she tried to speak or had she been conscious of half\\nmrs jenningss wellmeant but illjudged attentions\\nto her this calmness could not have been maintained\\nbut not a syllable escaped her lips and the abstraction\\nof her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing\\nthat was passing before her\\n\\nelinor who did justice to mrs jenningss kindness\\nthough its effusions were often distressing and sometimes\\nalmost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments\\nand returned her those civilities which her sister could\\nnot make or return for herself  their good friend saw\\nthat marianne was unhappy and felt that every thing\\nwas due to her which might make her at all less so\\nshe treated her therefore with all the indulgent fondness\\nof a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of\\nits holidays  marianne was to have the best place by the fire\\nwas to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house\\nand to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day\\nhad not elinor in the sad countenance of her sister\\nseen a check to all mirth she could have been entertained\\nby mrs jenningss endeavours to cure a disappointment in love\\nby a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a good fire\\nas soon however as the consciousness of all this was\\nforced by continual repetition on marianne she could\\nstay no longer  with a hasty exclamation of misery\\nand a sign to her sister not to follow her she directly got\\nup and hurried out of the room\\n\\npoor soul cried mrs jennings as soon as she was gone\\nhow it grieves me to see her  and i declare if she is\\nnot gone away without finishing her wine  and the dried\\ncherries too  lord nothing seems to do her any good\\ni am sure if i knew of any thing she would like i would\\nsend all over the town for it  well it is the oddest\\nthing to me that a man should use such a pretty girl\\nso ill  but when there is plenty of money on one side\\nand next to none on the other lord bless you they care\\nno more about such things\\n\\nthe lady thenmiss grey i think you called her\\nis very rich\\n\\nfifty thousand pounds my dear  did you ever see\\nher a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome\\ni remember her aunt very well biddy henshawe she married\\na very wealthy man  but the family are all rich together\\nfifty thousand pounds and by all accounts it wont come\\nbefore its wanted for they say he is all to pieces\\nno wonder dashing about with his curricle and hunters\\nwell it dont signify talking but when a young man\\nbe who he will comes and makes love to a pretty girl\\nand promises marriage he has no business to fly off\\nfrom his word only because he grows poor and a richer\\ngirl is ready to have him  why dont he in such a case\\nsell his horses let his house turn off his servants\\nand make a thorough reform at once i warrant you\\nmiss marianne would have been ready to wait till matters\\ncame round  but that wont do nowadays nothing in the\\nway of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of\\nthis age\\n\\ndo you know what kind of a girl miss grey is\\nis she said to be amiable\\n\\ni never heard any harm of her indeed i hardly ever\\nheard her mentioned except that mrs taylor did say\\nthis morning that one day miss walker hinted to her\\nthat she believed mr and mrs ellison would not be sorry\\nto have miss grey married for she and mrs ellison could\\nnever agree\\n\\nand who are the ellisons\\n\\nher guardians my dear  but now she is of age\\nand may choose for herself and a pretty choice she has\\nmadewhat now after pausing a momentyour poor sister\\nis gone to her own room i suppose to moan by herself\\nis there nothing one can get to comfort her  poor dear\\nit seems quite cruel to let her be alone  well byandby we\\nshall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little\\nwhat shall we play at  she hates whist i know but is there\\nno round game she cares for\\n\\ndear maam this kindness is quite unnecessary\\nmarianne i dare say will not leave her room again\\nthis evening  i shall persuade her if i can to go\\nearly to bed for i am sure she wants rest\\n\\naye i believe that will be best for her  let her name\\nher own supper and go to bed  lord no wonder she has\\nbeen looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two\\nfor this matter i suppose has been hanging over her head as\\nlong as that  and so the letter that came today finished it\\npoor soul  i am sure if i had had a notion of it\\ni would not have joked her about it for all my money\\nbut then you know how should i guess such a thing  i made\\nsure of its being nothing but a common love letter and\\nyou know young people like to be laughed at about them  lord\\nhow concerned sir john and my daughters will be when they\\nhear it  if i had my senses about me i might have called\\nin conduit street in my way home and told them of it\\nbut i shall see them tomorrow\\n\\nit would be unnecessary i am sure for you to caution\\nmrs palmer and sir john against ever naming mr willoughby\\nor making the slightest allusion to what has passed\\nbefore my sister  their own goodnature must point out\\nto them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing\\nabout it when she is present and the less that may ever\\nbe said to myself on the subject the more my feelings\\nwill be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe\\n\\noh lord yes that i do indeed  it must be terrible\\nfor you to hear it talked of and as for your sister\\ni am sure i would not mention a word about it to her\\nfor the world  you saw i did not all dinner time\\nno more would sir john nor my daughters for they are\\nall very thoughtful and considerate especially if i\\ngive them a hint as i certainly will  for my part\\ni think the less that is said about such things the better\\nthe sooner tis blown over and forgot  and what does\\ntalking ever do you know\\n\\nin this affair it can only do harm more so\\nperhaps than in many cases of a similar kind for it\\nhas been attended by circumstances which for the sake\\nof every one concerned in it make it unfit to become\\nthe public conversation  i must do this justice to\\nmr willoughbyhe has broken no positive engagement\\nwith my sister\\n\\nlaw my dear  dont pretend to defend him\\nno positive engagement indeed after taking her all\\nover allenham house and fixing on the very rooms they\\nwere to live in hereafter\\n\\nelinor for her sisters sake could not press the\\nsubject farther and she hoped it was not required of her\\nfor willoughbys since though marianne might lose much\\nhe could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth\\nafter a short silence on both sides mrs jennings\\nwith all her natural hilarity burst forth again\\n\\nwell my dear tis a true saying about an illwind\\nfor it will be all the better for colonel brandon\\nhe will have her at last aye that he will  mind me\\nnow if they ant married by midsummer  lord how hell\\nchuckle over this news  i hope he will come tonight\\nit will be all to one a better match for your sister\\ntwo thousand a year without debt or drawbackexcept\\nthe little lovechild indeed aye i had forgot her\\nbut she may be prenticed out at a small cost and then\\nwhat does it signify  delaford is a nice place i can\\ntell you exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place\\nfull of comforts and conveniences quite shut in with great\\ngarden walls that are covered with the best fruittrees\\nin the country and such a mulberry tree in one corner\\nlord how charlotte and i did stuff the only time we\\nwere there  then there is a dovecote some delightful\\nstewponds and a very pretty canal and every thing\\nin short that one could wish for and moreover it is\\nclose to the church and only a quarter of a mile from\\nthe turnpikeroad so tis never dull for if you only\\ngo and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house\\nyou may see all the carriages that pass along\\noh tis a nice place  a butcher hard by in the village\\nand the parsonagehouse within a stones throw\\nto my fancy a thousand times prettier than barton park\\nwhere they are forced to send three miles for their meat\\nand have not a neighbour nearer than your mother\\nwell i shall spirit up the colonel as soon as i can\\none shoulder of mutton you know drives another down\\nif we can but put willoughby out of her head\\n\\nay if we can do that maam said elinor\\nwe shall do very well with or without colonel brandon\\nand then rising she went away to join marianne\\nwhom she found as she expected in her own room leaning\\nin silent misery over the small remains of a fire\\nwhich till elinors entrance had been her only light\\n\\nyou had better leave me was all the notice\\nthat her sister received from her\\n\\ni will leave you said elinor if you will go\\nto bed but this from the momentary perverseness\\nof impatient suffering she at first refused to do\\nher sisters earnest though gentle persuasion however\\nsoon softened her to compliance and elinor saw her\\nlay her aching head on the pillow and as she hoped\\nin a way to get some quiet rest before she left her\\n\\nin the drawingroom whither she then repaired\\nshe was soon joined by mrs jennings with a wineglass\\nfull of something in her hand\\n\\nmy dear said she entering i have just recollected\\nthat i have some of the finest old constantia wine in the\\nhouse that ever was tasted so i have brought a glass of it\\nfor your sister  my poor husband how fond he was of it\\nwhenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout he said\\nit did him more good than any thing else in the world\\ndo take it to your sister\\n\\ndear maam replied elinor smiling at the difference\\nof the complaints for which it was recommended how good\\nyou are  but i have just left marianne in bed and i hope\\nalmost asleep and as i think nothing will be of so much\\nservice to her as rest if you will give me leave\\ni will drink the wine myself\\n\\nmrs jennings though regretting that she had not been\\nfive minutes earlier was satisfied with the compromise\\nand elinor as she swallowed the chief of it reflected\\nthat though its effects on a colicky gout were at present\\nof little importance to her its healing powers\\non a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried\\non herself as on her sister\\n\\ncolonel brandon came in while the party were at tea\\nand by his manner of looking round the room for marianne\\nelinor immediately fancied that he neither expected\\nnor wished to see her there and in short that he\\nwas already aware of what occasioned her absence\\nmrs jennings was not struck by the same thought\\nfor soon after his entrance she walked across the room\\nto the teatable where elinor presided and whispered\\nthe colonel looks as grave as ever you see  he knows\\nnothing of it do tell him my dear\\n\\nhe shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers\\nand with a look which perfectly assured her of his\\ngood information inquired after her sister\\n\\nmarianne is not well said she  she has been\\nindisposed all day and we have persuaded her to go to bed\\n\\nperhaps then he hesitatingly replied what i\\nheard this morning may bethere may be more truth in it\\nthan i could believe possible at first\\n\\nwhat did you hear\\n\\nthat a gentleman whom i had reason to thinkin short\\nthat a man whom i knew to be engagedbut how shall i\\ntell you  if you know it already as surely you must\\ni may be spared\\n\\nyou mean answered elinor with forced calmness\\nmr willoughbys marriage with miss grey  yes we do\\nknow it all  this seems to have been a day of general\\nelucidation for this very morning first unfolded it to us\\nmr willoughby is unfathomable  where did you hear it\\n\\nin a stationers shop in pall mall where i\\nhad business  two ladies were waiting for their carriage\\nand one of them was giving the other an account of the\\nintended match in a voice so little attempting concealment\\nthat it was impossible for me not to hear all  the name\\nof willoughby john willoughby frequently repeated\\nfirst caught my attention and what followed was a positive\\nassertion that every thing was now finally settled\\nrespecting his marriage with miss greyit was no longer\\nto be a secretit would take place even within a few weeks\\nwith many particulars of preparations and other matters\\none thing especially i remember because it served\\nto identify the man still moreas soon as the ceremony\\nwas over they were to go to combe magna his seat\\nin somersetshire  my astonishmentbut it would be\\nimpossible to describe what i felt  the communicative\\nlady i learnt on inquiry for i stayed in the shop\\ntill they were gone was a mrs ellison and that as i\\nhave been since informed is the name of miss greys guardian\\n\\nit is  but have you likewise heard that miss grey\\nhas fifty thousand pounds  in that if in any thing\\nwe may find an explanation\\n\\nit may be so but willoughby is capableat least\\ni thinkhe stopped a moment then added in a voice\\nwhich seemed to distrust itself and your sister\\nhow did she\\n\\nher sufferings have been very severe  i have\\nonly to hope that they may be proportionately short\\nit has been it is a most cruel affliction  till yesterday\\ni believe she never doubted his regard and even now\\nperhapsbut i am almost convinced that he never was\\nreally attached to her  he has been very deceitful and\\nin some points there seems a hardness of heart about him\\n\\nah said colonel brandon there is indeed  but\\nyour sister does noti think you said soshe does\\nnot consider quite as you do\\n\\nyou know her disposition and may believe how eagerly\\nshe would still justify him if she could\\n\\nhe made no answer and soon afterwards by the removal\\nof the teathings and the arrangement of the card parties\\nthe subject was necessarily dropped  mrs jennings who had\\nwatched them with pleasure while they were talking and who\\nexpected to see the effect of miss dashwoods communication\\nin such an instantaneous gaiety on colonel brandons side\\nas might have become a man in the bloom of youth of hope\\nand happiness saw him with amazement remain the whole\\nevening more serious and thoughtful than usual\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 31\\n\\n\\nfrom a night of more sleep than she had expected\\nmarianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness\\nof misery in which she had closed her eyes\\n\\nelinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk\\nof what she felt and before breakfast was ready they had\\ngone through the subject again and again and with the same\\nsteady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinors side\\nthe same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on\\nmariannes as before  sometimes she could believe\\nwilloughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself\\nand at others lost every consolation in the impossibility\\nof acquitting him  at one moment she was absolutely\\nindifferent to the observation of all the world at another\\nshe would seclude herself from it for ever and at a third\\ncould resist it with energy  in one thing however\\nshe was uniform when it came to the point in avoiding\\nwhere it was possible the presence of mrs jennings\\nand in a determined silence when obliged to endure it\\nher heart was hardened against the belief of mrs jenningss\\nentering into her sorrows with any compassion\\n\\nno no no it cannot be she cried\\nshe cannot feel  her kindness is not sympathy\\nher goodnature is not tenderness  all that she wants\\nis gossip and she only likes me now because i supply it\\n\\nelinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice\\nto which her sister was often led in her opinion of others\\nby the irritable refinement of her own mind and the too\\ngreat importance placed by her on the delicacies of a\\nstrong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner\\nlike half the rest of the world if more than half there\\nbe that are clever and good marianne with excellent\\nabilities and an excellent disposition was neither\\nreasonable nor candid  she expected from other people\\nthe same opinions and feelings as her own and she judged\\nof their motives by the immediate effect of their actions\\non herself  thus a circumstance occurred while the\\nsisters were together in their own room after breakfast\\nwhich sunk the heart of mrs jennings still lower\\nin her estimation because through her own weakness\\nit chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself\\nthough mrs jennings was governed in it by an impulse\\nof the utmost goodwill\\n\\nwith a letter in her outstretched hand and countenance\\ngaily smiling from the persuasion of bringing comfort\\nshe entered their room saying\\n\\nnow my dear i bring you something that i am sure\\nwill do you good\\n\\nmarianne heard enough  in one moment her imagination\\nplaced before her a letter from willoughby full of tenderness\\nand contrition explanatory of all that had passed satisfactory\\nconvincing and instantly followed by willoughby himself\\nrushing eagerly into the room to inforce at her feet\\nby the eloquence of his eyes the assurances of his letter\\nthe work of one moment was destroyed by the next\\nthe hand writing of her mother never till then unwelcome\\nwas before her and in the acuteness of the disappointment\\nwhich followed such an ecstasy of more than hope\\nshe felt as if till that instant she had never suffered\\n\\nthe cruelty of mrs jennings no language within\\nher reach in her moments of happiest eloquence\\ncould have expressed and now she could reproach her\\nonly by the tears which streamed from her eyes with\\npassionate violencea reproach however so entirely\\nlost on its object that after many expressions of pity\\nshe withdrew still referring her to the letter of comfort\\nbut the letter when she was calm enough to read it\\nbrought little comfort  willoughby filled every page\\nher mother still confident of their engagement and relying\\nas warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused\\nby elinors application to intreat from marianne greater\\nopenness towards them both and this with such tenderness\\ntowards her such affection for willoughby and such\\na conviction of their future happiness in each other\\nthat she wept with agony through the whole of it\\n\\nall her impatience to be at home again now returned\\nher mother was dearer to her than ever dearer through\\nthe very excess of her mistaken confidence in willoughby\\nand she was wildly urgent to be gone  elinor unable herself\\nto determine whether it were better for marianne to be\\nin london or at barton offered no counsel of her own\\nexcept of patience till their mothers wishes could be known\\nand at length she obtained her sisters consent to wait\\nfor that knowledge\\n\\nmrs jennings left them earlier than usual for she\\ncould not be easy till the middletons and palmers were able\\nto grieve as much as herself and positively refusing\\nelinors offered attendance went out alone for the rest\\nof the morning  elinor with a very heavy heart aware of\\nthe pain she was going to communicate and perceiving\\nby mariannes letter how ill she had succeeded in laying\\nany foundation for it then sat down to write her mother\\nan account of what had passed and entreat her directions\\nfor the future while marianne who came into the drawingroom\\non mrs jenningss going away remained fixed at the table\\nwhere elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen\\ngrieving over her for the hardship of such a task\\nand grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother\\n\\nin this manner they had continued about a quarter\\nof an hour when marianne whose nerves could not then\\nbear any sudden noise was startled by a rap at the door\\n\\nwho can this be cried elinor  so early too i\\nthought we had been safe\\n\\nmarianne moved to the window\\n\\nit is colonel brandon said she with vexation\\nwe are never safe from him\\n\\nhe will not come in as mrs jennings is from home\\n\\ni will not trust to that retreating to her own room\\na man who has nothing to do with his own time has no\\nconscience in his intrusion on that of others\\n\\nthe event proved her conjecture right though it\\nwas founded on injustice and error for colonel brandon\\ndid come in and elinor who was convinced that\\nsolicitude for marianne brought him thither and who saw\\nthat solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look\\nand in his anxious though brief inquiry after her\\ncould not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly\\n\\ni met mrs jennings in bond street said he\\nafter the first salutation and she encouraged me\\nto come on and i was the more easily encouraged\\nbecause i thought it probable that i might find you alone\\nwhich i was very desirous of doing  my objectmy\\nwishmy sole wish in desiring iti hope i believe\\nit isis to be a means of giving comfortno i must\\nnot say comfortnot present comfortbut conviction\\nlasting conviction to your sisters mind  my regard for her\\nfor yourself for your motherwill you allow me to prove it\\nby

me a very awkward narrator\\nmiss dashwood i hardly know where to begin  a short\\naccount of myself i believe will be necessary and it\\nshall be a short one  on such a subject sighing heavily\\ncan i have little temptation to be diffuse\\n\\nhe stopt a moment for recollection and then\\nwith another sigh went on\\n\\nyou have probably entirely forgotten a conversation\\nit is not to be supposed that it could make any impression\\non youa conversation between us one evening at barton\\nparkit was the evening of a dancein which i alluded\\nto a lady i had once known as resembling in some measure\\nyour sister marianne\\n\\nindeed answered elinor i have not forgotten it\\nhe looked pleased by this remembrance and added\\n\\nif i am not deceived by the uncertainty the partiality\\nof tender recollection there is a very strong resemblance\\nbetween them as well in mind as person  the same warmth\\nof heart the same eagerness of fancy and spirits\\nthis lady was one of my nearest relations an orphan from\\nher infancy and under the guardianship of my father\\nour ages were nearly the same and from our earliest years\\nwe were playfellows and friends  i cannot remember the\\ntime when i did not love eliza and my affection for her\\nas we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my\\npresent forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me\\nincapable of having ever felt  hers for me was i believe\\nfervent as the attachment of your sister to mr willoughby\\nand it was though from a different cause no less unfortunate\\nat seventeen she was lost to me for ever  she was\\nmarriedmarried against her inclination to my brother\\nher fortune was large and our family estate much encumbered\\nand this i fear is all that can be said for the\\nconduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian\\nmy brother did not deserve her he did not even love her\\ni had hoped that her regard for me would support her\\nunder any difficulty and for some time it did but at\\nlast the misery of her situation for she experienced\\ngreat unkindness overcame all her resolution and though\\nshe had promised me that nothingbut how blindly i\\nrelate  i have never told you how this was brought on\\nwe were within a few hours of eloping together for scotland\\nthe treachery or the folly of my cousins maid betrayed us\\ni was banished to the house of a relation far distant\\nand she was allowed no liberty no society no amusement\\ntill my fathers point was gained  i had depended on her\\nfortitude too far and the blow was a severe one\\nbut had her marriage been happy so young as i then was\\na few months must have reconciled me to it or at least\\ni should not have now to lament it  this however\\nwas not the case  my brother had no regard for her\\nhis pleasures were not what they ought to have been\\nand from the first he treated her unkindly  the consequence\\nof this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced\\nas mrs brandons was but too natural  she resigned\\nherself at first to all the misery of her situation\\nand happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those\\nregrets which the remembrance of me occasioned  but can we\\nwonder that with such a husband to provoke inconstancy\\nand without a friend to advise or restrain her for\\nmy father lived only a few months after their marriage\\nand i was with my regiment in the east indies she\\nshould fall  had i remained in england perhapsbut i\\nmeant to promote the happiness of both by removing\\nfrom her for years and for that purpose had procured\\nmy exchange  the shock which her marriage had given me\\nhe continued in a voice of great agitation was of\\ntrifling weightwas nothing to what i felt when i heard\\nabout two years afterwards of her divorce  it was\\nthat which threw this gloomeven now the recollection\\nof what i suffered\\n\\nhe could say no more and rising hastily walked for a few\\nminutes about the room  elinor affected by his relation\\nand still more by his distress could not speak  he saw\\nher concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it\\nand kissed it with grateful respect  a few minutes more\\nof silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure\\n\\nit was nearly three years after this unhappy\\nperiod before i returned to england  my first care\\nwhen i did arrive was of course to seek for her\\nbut the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy\\ni could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there\\nwas every reason to fear that she had removed from him\\nonly to sink deeper in a life of sin  her legal allowance\\nwas not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her\\ncomfortable maintenance and i learnt from my brother that\\nthe power of receiving it had been made over some months\\nbefore to another person  he imagined and calmly could he\\nimagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress\\nhad obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief\\nat last however and after i had been six months in england\\ni did find her  regard for a former servant of my own\\nwho had since fallen into misfortune carried me to visit\\nhim in a spunginghouse where he was confined for debt\\nand there the same house under a similar confinement\\nwas my unfortunate sister  so alteredso fadedworn\\ndown by acute suffering of every kind hardly could i\\nbelieve the melancholy and sickly figure before me\\nto be the remains of the lovely blooming healthful girl\\non whom i had once doted  what i endured in so beholding\\nherbut i have no right to wound your feelings by attempting\\nto describe iti have pained you too much already\\nthat she was to all appearance in the last stage\\nof a consumption wasyes in such a situation it was\\nmy greatest comfort  life could do nothing for her\\nbeyond giving time for a better preparation for death\\nand that was given  i saw her placed in comfortable lodgings\\nand under proper attendants i visited her every day\\nduring the rest of her short life i was with her in her\\nlast moments\\n\\nagain he stopped to recover himself and elinor\\nspoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern\\nat the fate of his unfortunate friend\\n\\nyour sister i hope cannot be offended said he\\nby the resemblance i have fancied between her and my\\npoor disgraced relation  their fates their fortunes\\ncannot be the same and had the natural sweet\\ndisposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind\\nor a happier marriage she might have been all that you\\nwill live to see the other be  but to what does all this\\nlead  i seem to have been distressing you for nothing\\nah miss dashwooda subject such as thisuntouched\\nfor fourteen yearsit is dangerous to handle it at all\\ni will be more collectedmore concise  she left to my care\\nher only child a little girl the offspring of her first\\nguilty connection who was then about three years old\\nshe loved the child and had always kept it with her\\nit was a valued a precious trust to me and gladly\\nwould i have discharged it in the strictest sense\\nby watching over her education myself had the nature\\nof our situations allowed it but i had no family no home\\nand my little eliza was therefore placed at school\\ni saw her there whenever i could and after the death of my\\nbrother which happened about five years ago and which\\nleft to me the possession of the family property she\\nvisited me at delaford  i called her a distant relation\\nbut i am well aware that i have in general been suspected\\nof a much nearer connection with her  it is now three\\nyears ago she had just reached her fourteenth year\\nthat i removed her from school to place her under the care\\nof a very respectable woman residing in dorsetshire\\nwho had the charge of four or five other girls of about\\nthe same time of life and for two years i had every reason\\nto be pleased with her situation  but last february\\nalmost a twelvemonth back she suddenly disappeared\\ni had allowed her imprudently as it has since turned\\nout at her earnest desire to go to bath with one of\\nher young friends who was attending her father there\\nfor his health  i knew him to be a very good sort of man\\nand i thought well of his daughterbetter than she deserved\\nfor with a most obstinate and illjudged secrecy\\nshe would tell nothing would give no clue though she\\ncertainly knew all  he her father a wellmeaning\\nbut not a quicksighted man could really i believe\\ngive no information for he had been generally confined\\nto the house while the girls were ranging over the town\\nand making what acquaintance they chose and he tried\\nto convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself\\nof his daughters being entirely unconcerned in the business\\nin short i could learn nothing but that she was gone\\nall the rest for eight long months was left to conjecture\\nwhat i thought what i feared may be imagined and what i\\nsuffered too\\n\\ngood heavens cried elinor could it becould\\nwilloughby\\n\\nthe first news that reached me of her he continued\\ncame in a letter from herself last october\\nit was forwarded to me from delaford and i received it\\non the very morning of our intended party to whitwell\\nand this was the reason of my leaving barton so suddenly\\nwhich i am sure must at the time have appeared strange\\nto every body and which i believe gave offence to some\\nlittle did mr willoughby imagine i suppose when his\\nlooks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party\\nthat i was called away to the relief of one whom he\\nhad made poor and miserable but had he known it\\nwhat would it have availed  would he have been less\\ngay or less happy in the smiles of your sister  no\\nhe had already done that which no man who can feel\\nfor another would do  he had left the girl whose\\nyouth and innocence he had seduced in a situation of\\nthe utmost distress with no creditable home no

now before you expensive dissipated\\nand worse than both  knowing all this as i have now\\nknown it many weeks guess what i must have felt on seeing\\nyour sister as fond of him as ever and on being assured\\nthat she was to marry him guess what i must have felt\\nfor all your sakes  when i came to you last week and\\nfound you alone i came determined to know the truth\\nthough irresolute what to do when it was known\\nmy behaviour must have seemed strange to you then\\nbut now you will comprehend it  to suffer you all to be\\nso deceived to see your sisterbut what could i do\\ni had no hope of interfering with success and sometimes\\ni thought your sisters influence might yet reclaim him\\nbut now after such dishonorable usage who can tell what\\nwere his designs on her  whatever they may have been\\nhowever she may now and hereafter doubtless will\\nturn with gratitude towards her own condition when she\\ncompares it with that of my poor eliza when she considers\\nthe wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl\\nand pictures her to herself with an affection for him so strong\\nstill as strong as her own and with a mind tormented\\nby selfreproach which must attend her through life\\nsurely this comparison must have its use with her\\nshe will feel her own sufferings to be nothing  they\\nproceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace\\non the contrary every friend must be made still more\\nher friend by them  concern for her unhappiness\\nand respect for her fortitude under it must strengthen\\nevery attachment  use your own discretion however\\nin communicating to her what i have told you  you must\\nknow best what will be its effect but had i not seriously\\nand from my heart believed it might be of service\\nmight lessen her regrets i would not have suffered\\nmyself to trouble you with this account of my family\\nafflictions with a recital which may seem to have been\\nintended to raise myself at the expense of others\\n\\nelinors thanks followed this speech with grateful\\nearnestness attended too with the assurance of her\\nexpecting material advantage to marianne from the\\ncommunication of what had passed\\n\\ni have been more pained said she by her\\nendeavors to acquit him than by all the rest for it\\nirritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction\\nof his unworthiness can do  now though at first she\\nwill suffer much i am sure she will soon become easier\\nhave you she continued after a short silence\\never seen mr willoughby since you left him at barton\\n\\nyes he replied gravely once i have  one meeting\\nwas unavoidable\\n\\nelinor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously\\nsaying\\n\\nwhat have you met him to\\n\\ni could meet him no other way  eliza had confessed\\nto me though most reluctantly the name of her lover\\nand when he returned to town which was within a fortnight\\nafter myself we met by appointment he to defend\\ni to punish his conduct  we returned unwounded\\nand the meeting therefore never got abroad\\n\\nelinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this\\nbut to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it\\n\\nsuch said colonel brandon after a pause\\nhas been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother\\nand daughter and so imperfectly have i discharged my trust\\n\\nis she still in town\\n\\nno as soon as she recovered from her lyingin\\nfor i found her near her delivery i removed her and her\\nchild into the country and there she remains\\n\\nrecollecting soon afterwards that he was probably\\ndividing elinor from her sister he put an end to his visit\\nreceiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments\\nand leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 32\\n\\n\\nwhen the particulars of this conversation were repeated\\nby miss dashwood to her sister as they very soon were\\nthe effect on her was not entirely such as the former\\nhad hoped to see  not that marianne appeared to distrust\\nthe truth of any part of it for she listened to it all\\nwith the most steady and submissive attention made neither\\nobjection nor remark attempted no vindication of willoughby\\nand seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to\\nbe impossible  but though this behaviour assured elinor\\nthat the conviction of this guilt was carried home to\\nher mind though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it\\nin her no longer avoiding colonel brandon when he called\\nin her speaking to him even voluntarily speaking\\nwith a kind of compassionate respect and though she\\nsaw her spirits less violently irritated than before\\nshe did not see her less wretched  her mind did become\\nsettled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection\\nshe felt the loss of willoughbys character yet more heavily\\nthan she had felt the loss of his heart his seduction and\\ndesertion of miss williams the misery of that poor girl\\nand the doubt of what his designs might once have been\\non herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits\\nthat she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt\\neven to elinor and brooding over her sorrows in silence\\ngave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated\\nby the most open and most frequent confession of them\\n\\nto give the feelings or the language of mrs dashwood\\non receiving and answering elinors letter would be only\\nto give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt\\nand said of a disappointment hardly less painful than\\nmariannes and an indignation even greater than elinors\\nlong letters from her quickly succeeding each other\\narrived to tell all that she suffered and thought\\nto express her anxious solicitude for marianne and entreat\\nshe would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune\\nbad indeed must the nature of mariannes affliction be\\nwhen her mother could talk of fortitude mortifying\\nand humiliating must be the origin of those regrets\\nwhich she could wish her not to indulge\\n\\nagainst the interest of her own individual comfort\\nmrs dashwood had determined that it would be better for\\nmarianne to be any where at that time than at barton\\nwhere every thing within her view would be bringing back\\nthe past in the strongest and most afflicting manner\\nby constantly placing willoughby before her such as\\nshe had always seen him there  she recommended it to\\nher daughters therefore by all means not to shorten their\\nvisit to mrs jennings the length of which though never\\nexactly fixed had been expected by all to comprise at least\\nfive or six weeks  a variety of occupations of objects\\nand of company which could not be procured at barton\\nwould be inevitable there and might yet she hoped\\ncheat marianne at times into some interest beyond herself\\nand even into some amusement much as the ideas of both\\nmight now be spurned by her\\n\\nfrom all danger of seeing willoughby again\\nher mother considered her to be at least equally safe\\nin town as in the country since his acquaintance must\\nnow be dropped by all who called themselves her friends\\ndesign could never bring them in each others way\\nnegligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise\\nand chance had less in its favour in the crowd of london\\nthan even in the retirement of barton where it might\\nforce him before her while paying that visit at allenham\\non his marriage which mrs dashwood from foreseeing at\\nfirst as a probable event had brought herself to expect\\nas a certain one\\n\\nshe had yet another reason for wishing her children\\nto remain where they were a letter from her soninlaw\\nhad told her that he and his wife were to be in town\\nbefore the middle of february and she judged it right\\nthat they should sometimes see their brother\\n\\nmarianne had promised to be guided by her mothers opinion\\nand she submitted to it therefore without opposition\\nthough it proved perfectly different from what she wished\\nand expected though she felt it to be entirely wrong\\nformed on mistaken grounds and that by requiring her\\nlonger continuance in london it deprived her of the only\\npossible alleviation of her wretchedness the personal\\nsympathy of her mother and doomed her to such society and\\nsuch scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moments rest\\n\\nbut it was a matter of great consolation to her\\nthat what brought evil to herself would bring good to\\nher sister and elinor on the other hand suspecting that\\nit would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely\\ncomforted herself by thinking that though their longer\\nstay would therefore militate against her own happiness\\nit would be better for marianne than an immediate return\\ninto devonshire\\n\\nher carefulness in guarding her sister from ever\\nhearing willoughbys name mentioned was not thrown away\\nmarianne though without knowing it herself reaped all\\nits advantage for neither mrs jennings nor sir john\\nnor even mrs palmer herself ever spoke of him before her\\nelinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended\\ntowards herself but that was impossible and she was\\nobliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all\\n\\nsir john could not have thought it possible\\na man of whom he had always had such reason to think well\\nsuch a goodnatured fellow  he did not believe there was a\\nbolder rider in england  it was an unaccountable business\\nhe wished him at the devil with all his heart  he would\\nnot speak another word to him meet him where he might\\nfor all the world  no not if it were to be by the side\\nof barton covert and they were kept watching for two\\nhours together  such a scoundrel of a fellow such\\na deceitful dog  it was only the last time they met\\nthat he had offered him one of follys puppies and this\\nwas the end of it\\n\\nmrs palmer in her way was equally angry\\nshe was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately\\nand she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted\\nwith him at all  she wished with all her heart combe\\nmagna was not so near cleveland but it did not signify\\nfor it was a great deal too far off to visit she hated\\nhim so much that she was resolved never to mention\\nhis name again and she should tell everybody she saw\\nhow goodfornothing he was\\n\\nthe rest of mrs palmers sympathy was shewn in procuring\\nall the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage\\nand communicating them to elinor  she could soon tell\\nat what coachmakers the new carriage was building\\nby what painter mr willoughbys portrait was drawn\\nand at what warehouse miss greys clothes might be seen\\n\\nthe calm and polite unconcern of lady middleton\\non the occasion was a happy relief to elinors spirits\\noppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness\\nof the others  it was a great comfort to her to be sure\\nof exciting no interest in one person at least among their\\ncircle of friends a great comfort to know that there\\nwas one who would meet her without feeling any curiosity\\nafter particulars or any anxiety for her sisters health\\n\\nevery qualification is raised at times by the\\ncircumstances of the moment to more than its real value\\nand she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence\\nto rate goodbreeding as more indispensable to comfort\\nthan goodnature\\n\\nlady middleton expressed her sense of the affair\\nabout once every day or twice if the subject occurred\\nvery often by saying it is very shocking indeed\\nand by the means of this continual though gentle vent\\nwas able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the\\nfirst without the smallest emotion but very soon\\nto see them without recollecting a word of the matter\\nand having thus supported the dignity of her own sex\\nand spoken her decided censure of what was wrong\\nin the other she thought herself at liberty to attend\\nto the interest of her own assemblies and therefore\\ndetermined though rather against the opinion of sir john\\nthat as mrs willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance\\nand fortune to leave her card with her as soon as she married\\n\\ncolonel brandons delicate unobtrusive enquiries\\nwere never unwelcome to miss dashwood  he had abundantly\\nearned the privilege of intimate discussion of her\\nsisters disappointment by the friendly zeal with\\nwhich he had endeavoured to soften it and they always\\nconversed with confidence  his chief reward for the\\npainful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present\\nhumiliations was given in the pitying eye with which\\nmarianne sometimes observed him and the gentleness\\nof her voice whenever though it did not often happen\\nshe was obliged or could oblige herself to speak to him\\nthese assured him that his exertion had produced an\\nincrease of goodwill towards himself and these gave\\nelinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter\\nbut mrs jennings who knew nothing of all this who knew\\nonly that the colonel continued as grave as ever and that\\nshe could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself\\nnor commission her to make it for him began at the\\nend of two days to think that instead of midsummer\\nthey would not be married till michaelmas and by the\\nend of a week that it would not be a match at all\\nthe good understanding between the colonel and miss\\ndashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours\\nof the mulberrytree the canal and the yew arbour\\nwould all be made over to her and mrs jennings had\\nfor some time ceased to think at all of mrs ferrars\\n\\nearly in february within a fortnight from the\\nreceipt of willoughbys letter elinor had the painful\\noffice of informing her sister that he was married\\nshe had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed\\nto herself as soon as it was known that the ceremony\\nwas over as she was desirous that marianne should not\\nreceive the first notice of it from the public papers\\nwhich she saw her eagerly examining every morning\\n\\nshe received the news with resolute composure\\nmade no observation on it and at first shed no tears\\nbut after a short time they would burst out and for the\\nrest of the day she was in a state hardly less pitiable\\nthan when she first learnt to expect the event\\n\\nthe willoughbys left town as soon as they were married\\nand elinor now hoped as there could be no danger\\nof her seeing either of them to prevail on her sister\\nwho had never yet left the house since the blow first fell\\nto go out again by degrees as she had done before\\n\\nabout this time the two miss steeles lately arrived\\nat their cousins house in bartletts buildings\\nholburn presented themselves again before their more\\ngrand relations in conduit and berkeley streets\\nand were welcomed by them all with great cordiality\\n\\nelinor only was sorry to see them  their presence\\nalways gave her pain and she hardly knew how to make\\na very gracious return to the overpowering delight of lucy\\nin finding her still in town\\n\\ni should have been quite disappointed if i had not\\nfound you here still said she repeatedly with a strong\\nemphasis on the word  but i always thought i should\\ni was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile\\nthough you told me you know at barton that you should\\nnot stay above a month  but i thought at the time\\nthat you would most likely change your mind when it came\\nto the point  it would have been such a great pity\\nto have went away before your brother and sister came\\nand now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone\\ni am amazingly glad you did not keep to your word\\n\\nelinor perfectly understood her and was forced\\nto use all her selfcommand to make it appear that she\\ndid not\\n\\nwell my dear said mrs jennings and how did\\nyou travel\\n\\nnot in the stage i assure you replied miss steele\\nwith quick exultation we came post all the way and had\\na very smart beau to attend us  dr davies was coming\\nto town and so we thought wed join him in a postchaise\\nand he behaved very genteelly and paid ten or twelve\\nshillings more than we did\\n\\noh oh cried mrs jennings very pretty\\nindeed and the doctor is a single man i warrant you\\n\\nthere now said miss steele affectedly simpering\\neverybody laughs at me so about the doctor and i\\ncannot think why  my cousins say they are sure i have\\nmade a conquest but for my part i declare i never think\\nabout him from one hours end to another  lord here\\ncomes your beau nancy my cousin said tother day\\nwhen she saw him crossing the street to the house\\nmy beau indeed said ii cannot think who you mean\\nthe doctor is no beau of mine\\n\\naye aye that is very pretty talkingbut it wont do\\nthe doctor is the man i see\\n\\nno indeed replied her cousin with affected earnestness\\nand i beg you will contradict it if you ever hear it talked\\nof\\n\\nmrs jennings directly gave her the gratifying\\nassurance that she certainly would not and miss steele\\nwas made completely happy\\n\\ni suppose you will go and stay with your brother\\nand sister miss dashwood when they come to town\\nsaid lucy returning after a cessation of hostile hints\\nto the charge\\n\\nno i do not think we shall\\n\\noh yes i dare say you will\\n\\nelinor would not humour her by farther opposition\\n\\nwhat a charming thing it is that mrs dashwood can\\nspare you both for so long a time together\\n\\nlong a time indeed interposed mrs jennings\\nwhy their visit is but just begun\\n\\nlucy was silenced\\n\\ni am sorry we cannot see your sister miss dashwood\\nsaid miss steele  i am sorry she is not well\\nfor marianne had left the room on their arrival\\n\\nyou are very good  my sister will be equally\\nsorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has\\nbeen very much plagued lately with nervous headaches\\nwhich make her unfit for company or conversation\\n\\noh dear that is a great pity but such old\\nfriends as lucy and mei think she might see us\\nand i am sure we would not speak a word\\n\\nelinor with great civility declined the proposal\\nher sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her\\ndressing gown and therefore not able to come to them\\n\\noh if thats all cried miss steele we can\\njust as well go and see her\\n\\nelinor began to find this impertinence too much for\\nher temper but she was saved the trouble of checking it\\nby lucys sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions\\nthough it did not give much sweetness to the manners\\nof one sister was of advantage in governing those of\\nthe other\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 33\\n\\n\\nafter some opposition marianne yielded to her\\nsisters entreaties and consented to go out with her\\nand mrs jennings one morning for half an hour she\\nexpressly conditioned however for paying no visits\\nand would do no more than accompany them to grays in\\nsackville street where elinor was carrying on a negotiation\\nfor the exchange of a few oldfashioned jewels of her mother\\n\\nwhen they stopped at the door mrs jennings recollected\\nthat there was a lady at the other end of the street\\non whom she ought to call and as she had no business\\nat grays it was resolved that while her young friends\\ntransacted theirs she should pay her visit and\\nreturn for them\\n\\non ascending the stairs the miss dashwoods found\\nso many people before them in the room that there was\\nnot a person at liberty to tend to their orders and they\\nwere obliged to wait  all that could be done was to sit\\ndown at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the\\nquickest succession one gentleman only was standing there\\nand it is probable that elinor was not without hope\\nof exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch\\nbut the correctness of his eye and the delicacy\\nof his taste proved to be beyond his politeness\\nhe was giving orders for a toothpickcase for himself\\nand till its size shape and ornaments were determined\\nall of which after examining and debating for a quarter\\nof an hour over every toothpickcase in the shop\\nwere finally arranged by his own inventive fancy he had\\nno leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies\\nthan what was comprised in three or four very broad stares\\na kind of notice which served to imprint on elinor\\nthe remembrance of a person and face of strong\\nnatural sterling insignificance though adorned in\\nthe first style of fashion\\n\\nmarianne was spared from the troublesome feelings\\nof contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination\\nof their features and on the puppyism of his manner\\nin deciding on all the different horrors of the different\\ntoothpickcases presented to his inspection by remaining\\nunconscious of it all for she was as well able to collect\\nher thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was\\npassing around her in mr grays shop as in her own bedroom\\n\\nat last the affair was decided  the ivory\\nthe gold and the pearls all received their appointment\\nand the gentleman having named the last day on which his\\nexistence could be continued without the possession of the\\ntoothpickcase drew on his gloves with leisurely care\\nand bestowing another glance on the miss dashwoods but such\\na one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration\\nwalked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected\\nindifference\\n\\nelinor lost no time in bringing her business forward\\nwas on the point of concluding it when another gentleman\\npresented himself at her side  she turned her eyes towards\\nhis face and found him with some surprise to be her brother\\n\\ntheir affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough\\nto make a very creditable appearance in mr grays shop\\njohn dashwood was really far from being sorry to see\\nhis sisters again it rather gave them satisfaction\\nand his inquiries after their mother were respectful\\nand attentive\\n\\nelinor found that he and fanny had been in town\\ntwo days\\n\\ni wished very much to call upon you yesterday\\nsaid he but it was impossible for we were obliged\\nto take harry to see the wild beasts at exeter exchange\\nand we spent the rest of the day with mrs ferrars\\nharry was vastly pleased  this morning i had fully intended\\nto call on you if i could possibly find a spare half hour\\nbut one has always so much to do on first coming to town\\ni am come here to bespeak fanny a seal  but tomorrow i\\nthink i shall certainly be able to call in berkeley street\\nand be introduced to your friend

they are excellent neighbours to you in\\nthe country i understand\\n\\nexcellent indeed  their attention to our comfort\\ntheir friendliness in every particular is more than i\\ncan express\\n\\ni am extremely glad to hear it upon my word\\nextremely glad indeed  but so it ought to be they are\\npeople of large fortune they are related to you and\\nevery civility and accommodation that can serve to make\\nyour situation pleasant might be reasonably expected\\nand so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage\\nand want for nothing  edward brought us a most charming\\naccount of the place the most complete thing of its kind\\nhe said that ever was and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond\\nany thing  it was a great satisfaction to us to hear it\\ni assure you\\n\\nelinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother\\nand was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him\\nby the arrival of mrs jenningss servant who came to tell\\nher that his mistress waited for them at the door\\n\\nmr dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced\\nto mrs jennings at the door of her carriage and repeating\\nhis hope of being able to call on them the next day\\ntook leave\\n\\nhis visit was duly paid  he came with a pretence at\\nan apology from their sisterinlaw for not coming too\\nbut she was so much engaged with her mother that really\\nshe had no leisure for going any where  mrs jennings\\nhowever assured him directly that she should not stand\\nupon ceremony for they were all cousins or something\\nlike it and she should certainly wait on mrs john\\ndashwood very soon and bring her sisters to see her\\nhis manners to them though calm were perfectly kind\\nto mrs jennings most attentively civil and on colonel\\nbrandons coming in soon after himself he eyed him with a\\ncuriosity which seemed to say that he only wanted to know\\nhim to be rich to be equally civil to him\\n\\nafter staying with them half an hour he asked\\nelinor to walk with him to conduit street and introduce\\nhim to sir john and lady middleton  the weather was\\nremarkably fine and she readily consented  as soon\\nas they were out of the house his enquiries began\\n\\nwho is colonel brandon  is he a man of fortune\\n\\nyes he has very good property in dorsetshire\\n\\ni am glad of it  he seems a most gentlemanlike man\\nand i think elinor i may congratulate you on the prospect\\nof a very respectable establishment in life\\n\\nme brother what do you mean\\n\\nhe likes you  i observed him narrowly and am\\nconvinced of it  what is the amount of his fortune\\n\\ni believe about two thousand a year\\n\\ntwo thousand ayear and then working himself\\nup to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added\\nelinor i wish with all my heart it were twice as much\\nfor your sake\\n\\nindeed i believe you replied elinor but i am\\nvery sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish\\nof marrying me\\n\\nyou are mistaken elinor you are very much mistaken\\na very little trouble on your side secures him\\nperhaps just at present he may be undecided the smallness\\nof your fortune may make him hang back his friends\\nmay all advise him against it  but some of those little\\nattentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily\\ngive will fix him in spite of himself  and there can be\\nno reason why you should not try for him  it is not to be\\nsupposed that any prior attachment on your sidein short\\nyou know as to an attachment of that kind it is quite\\nout of the question the objections are insurmountable\\nyou have too much sense not to see all that  colonel brandon\\nmust be the man and no civility shall be wanting on\\nmy part to make him pleased with you and your family\\nit is a match that must give universal satisfaction\\nin short it is a kind of thing thatlowering his voice\\nto an important whisperwill be exceedingly welcome\\nto all parties recollecting himself however he added\\nthat is i mean to sayyour friends are all truly\\nanxious to see you well settled fanny particularly\\nfor she has your interest very much at heart i assure you\\nand her mother too mrs ferrars a very goodnatured woman\\ni am sure it would give her great pleasure she said as much\\nthe other day\\n\\nelinor would not vouchsafe any answer\\n\\nit would be something remarkable now he continued\\nsomething droll if fanny should have a brother and i\\na sister settling at the same time  and yet it is not\\nvery unlikely\\n\\nis mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution\\ngoing to be married\\n\\nit is not actually settled but there is such\\na thing in agitation  he has a most excellent mother\\nmrs ferrars with the utmost liberality will come forward\\nand settle on him a thousand a year if the match\\ntakes place  the lady is the hon miss morton only daughter\\nof the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds\\na very desirable connection on both sides and i have not\\na doubt of its taking place in time  a thousand ayear\\nis a great deal for a mother to give away to make over\\nfor ever but mrs ferrars has a noble spirit  to give\\nyou another instance of her liberalitythe other day\\nas soon as we came to town aware that money could\\nnot be very plenty with us just now she put banknotes\\ninto fannys hands to the amount of two hundred pounds\\nand extremely acceptable it is for we must live at a great\\nexpense while we are here\\n\\nhe paused for her assent and compassion and she\\nforced herself to say\\n\\nyour expenses both in town and country must certainly\\nbe considerable but your income is a large one\\n\\nnot so large i dare say as many people suppose\\ni do not mean to complain however it is undoubtedly\\na comfortable one and i hope will in time be better\\nthe enclosure of norland common now carrying on\\nis a most serious drain  and then i have made a little\\npurchase within this half year east kingham farm\\nyou must remember the place where old gibson used to live\\nthe land was so very desirable for me in every respect\\nso immediately adjoining my own property that i felt it\\nmy duty to buy it  i could not have answered it to my\\nconscience to let it fall into any other hands  a man must\\npay for his convenience and it has cost me a vast deal\\nof money\\n\\nmore than you think it really and intrinsically worth\\n\\nwhy i hope not that  i might have sold it again\\nthe next day for more than i gave but with regard to the\\npurchasemoney i might have been very unfortunate indeed\\nfor the stocks were at that time so low that if i had not\\nhappened to have the necessary sum in my bankers hands\\ni must have sold out to very great loss\\n\\nelinor could only smile\\n\\nother great and inevitable expenses too we have\\nhad on first coming to norland  our respected father\\nas you well know bequeathed all the stanhill effects\\nthat remained at norland and very valuable they were\\nto your mother  far be it from me to repine at his\\ndoing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his\\nown property as he chose but in consequence of it\\nwe have been obliged to make large purchases of linen\\nchina c to supply the place of what was taken away\\nyou may guess after all these expenses how very far we\\nmust be from being rich and how acceptable mrs ferrarss\\nkindness is\\n\\ncertainly said elinor and assisted by her liberality\\ni hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances\\n\\nanother year or two may do much towards it\\nhe gravely replied but however there is still a great\\ndeal to be done  there is not a stone laid of fannys\\ngreenhouse and nothing but the plan of the flowergarden\\nmarked out\\n\\nwhere is the greenhouse to be\\n\\nupon the knoll behind the house  the old\\nwalnut trees are all come down to make room for it\\nit will be a very fine object from many parts of the park\\nand the flowergarden will slope down just before it\\nand be exceedingly pretty  we have cleared away all the old\\nthorns that grew in patches over the brow\\n\\nelinor kept her concern and her censure to herself\\nand was very thankful that marianne was not present\\nto share the provocation\\n\\nhaving now said enough to make his poverty clear\\nand to do away the necessity of buying a pair of earrings\\nfor each of his sisters in his next visit at grays\\nhis thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to\\ncongratulate elinor on having such a friend as mrs jennings\\n\\nshe seems a most valuable woman indeedher house\\nher style of living all bespeak an exceeding good income\\nand it is an acquaintance that has not only been\\nof great use to you hitherto but in the end may prove\\nmaterially advantageousher inviting you to town is\\ncertainly a vast thing in your favour and indeed it\\nspeaks altogether so great a regard for you that in all\\nprobability when she dies you will not be forgotten\\nshe must have a great deal to leave\\n\\nnothing at all i should rather suppose for she has\\nonly her jointure which will descend to her children\\n\\nbut it is not to be imagined that she lives up to\\nher income  few people of common prudence will do that\\nand whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of\\n\\nand do you not think it more likely that she\\nshould leave it to her daughters than to us\\n\\nher daughters are both exceedingly well married\\nand therefore i cannot perceive the necessity of her\\nremembering them farther  whereas in my opinion by her\\ntaking so much notice of you and treating you in this\\nkind of way she has given you a sort of claim on her\\nfuture consideration which a conscientious woman would\\nnot disregard  nothing can be kinder than her behaviour\\nand she can hardly do all this without being aware\\nof the expectation it raises\\n\\nbut she raises none in those most concerned\\nindeed brother your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity\\ncarries you too far\\n\\nwhy to be sure said he seeming to recollect himself\\npeople have little have very little in their power\\nbut my dear elinor what is the matter with marianne\\nshe looks very unwell has lost her colour and is grown\\nquite thin  is she ill\\n\\nshe is not well she has had a nervous complaint\\non her for several weeks\\n\\ni am sorry for that  at her time of life\\nany thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever\\nhers has been a very short one  she was as handsome a girl\\nlast september as i ever saw and as likely to attract\\nthe man  there was something in her style of beauty\\nto please them particularly  i remember fanny used to say\\nthat she would marry sooner and better than you did\\nnot but what she is exceedingly fond of you but so it\\nhappened to strike her  she will be mistaken however\\ni question whether marianne now will marry a man worth\\nmore than five or six hundred ayear at the utmost\\nand i am very much deceived if you do not do better\\ndorsetshire  i know very little of dorsetshire but my dear\\nelinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it\\nand i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself\\namong the earliest and best pleased of your visitors\\n\\nelinor tried very seriously to convince him that\\nthere was no likelihood of her marrying colonel brandon\\nbut it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself\\nto be relinquished and he was really resolved on seeking\\nan intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage\\nby every possible attention  he had just compunction\\nenough for having done nothing for his sisters himself\\nto be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should\\ndo a great deal and an offer from colonel brandon\\nor a legacy from mrs jennings was the easiest means\\nof atoning for his own neglect\\n\\nthey were lucky enough to find lady middleton\\nat home and sir john came in before their visit ended\\nabundance of civilities passed on all sides  sir john\\nwas ready to like anybody and though mr dashwood did\\nnot seem to know much about horses he soon set him\\ndown as a very goodnatured fellow while lady middleton\\nsaw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his\\nacquaintance worth having and mr dashwood went away\\ndelighted with both\\n\\ni shall have a charming account to carry\\nto fanny said he as he walked back with his sister\\nlady middleton is really a most elegant woman  such\\na woman as i am sure fanny will be glad to know\\nand mrs jennings too an exceedingly wellbehaved woman\\nthough not so elegant as her daughter  your sister need\\nnot have any scruple even of visiting her which to say\\nthe truth has been a little the case and very naturally\\nfor we only knew that mrs jennings was the widow of a man\\nwho had got all his money in a low way and fanny and\\nmrs ferrars were both strongly prepossessed that neither\\nshe nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny\\nwould like to associate with  but now i can carry her\\na most satisfactory account of both\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 34\\n\\n\\nmrs john dashwood had so much confidence in her\\nhusbands judgment that she waited the very next day\\nboth on mrs jennings and her daughter and her\\nconfidence was rewarded by finding even the former\\neven the woman with whom her sisters were staying\\nby no means unworthy her notice and as for lady middleton\\nshe found her one of the most charming women in the world\\n\\nlady middleton was equally pleased with mrs dashwood\\nthere was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides\\nwhich mutually attracted them and they sympathised\\nwith each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor\\nand a general want of understanding\\n\\nthe same manners however which recommended mrs john\\ndashwood to the good opinion of lady middleton did not suit\\nthe fancy of mrs jennings and to her she appeared nothing\\nmore than a little proudlooking woman of uncordial address\\nwho met her husbands sisters without any affection\\nand almost without having anything to say to them\\nfor of the quarter of an hour bestowed on berkeley street\\nshe sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence\\n\\nelinor wanted very much to know though she did\\nnot chuse to ask whether edward was then in town\\nbut nothing would have induced fanny voluntarily\\nto mention his name before her till able to tell her\\nthat his marriage with miss morton was resolved on\\nor till her husbands expectations on colonel brandon\\nwere answered because she believed them still so very\\nmuch attached to each other that they could not be too\\nsedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion\\nthe intelligence however which she would not give\\nsoon flowed from another quarter  lucy came very shortly\\nto claim elinors compassion on being unable to see edward\\nthough he had arrived in town with mr and mrs dashwood\\nhe dared not come to bartletts buildings for fear\\nof detection and though their mutual impatience to meet\\nwas not to be told they could do nothing at present\\nbut write\\n\\nedward assured them himself of his being in town\\nwithin a very short time by twice calling in berkeley street\\ntwice was his card found on the table when they returned\\nfrom their mornings engagements  elinor was pleased\\nthat he had called and still more pleased that she had\\nmissed him\\n\\nthe dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted\\nwith the middletons that though not much in the habit\\nof giving anything they determined to give them\\na dinner and soon after their acquaintance began\\ninvited them to dine in harley street where they had\\ntaken a very good house for three months  their sisters\\nand mrs jennings were invited likewise and john dashwood\\nwas careful to secure colonel brandon who always glad\\nto be where the miss dashwoods were received his eager\\ncivilities with some surprise but much more pleasure\\nthey were to meet mrs ferrars but elinor could not learn\\nwhether her sons were to be of the party  the expectation\\nof seeing her however was enough to make her interested\\nin the engagement for though she could now meet edwards\\nmother without that strong anxiety which had once promised\\nto attend such an introduction though she could now see\\nher with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself\\nher desire of being in company with mrs ferrars\\nher curiosity to know what she was like was as lively as ever\\n\\nthe interest with which she thus anticipated the\\nparty was soon afterwards increased more powerfully\\nthan pleasantly by her hearing that the miss steeles\\nwere also to be at it\\n\\nso well had they recommended themselves to lady middleton\\nso agreeable had their assiduities made them to her\\nthat though lucy was certainly not so elegant and her\\nsister not even genteel she was as ready as sir john\\nto ask them to spend a week or two in conduit street\\nand it happened to be particularly convenient to the miss\\nsteeles as soon as the dashwoods invitation was known\\nthat their visit should begin a few days before the party\\ntook place\\n\\ntheir claims to the notice of mrs john dashwood\\nas the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had\\nhad the care of her brother might not have done much\\nhowever towards procuring them seats at her table\\nbut as lady middletons guests they must be welcome and lucy\\nwho had long wanted to be personally known to the family\\nto have a nearer view of their characters and her own\\ndifficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring\\nto please them had seldom been happier in her life\\nthan she was on receiving mrs john dashwoods card\\n\\non elinor its effect was very different  she began\\nimmediately to determine that edward who lived with\\nhis mother must be asked as his mother was to a party\\ngiven by his sister and to see him for the first time\\nafter all that passed in the company of lucyshe hardly\\nknew how she could bear it\\n\\nthese apprehensions perhaps were not founded\\nentirely on reason and certainly not at all on truth\\nthey were relieved however not by her own recollection\\nbut by the good will of lucy who believed herself to be\\ninflicting a severe disappointment when she told her\\nthat edward certainly would not be in harley street on tuesday\\nand even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther\\nby persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme\\naffection for herself which he could not conceal when they\\nwere together\\n\\nthe important tuesday came that was to introduce\\nthe two young ladies to this formidable motherinlaw\\n\\npity me dear miss dashwood said lucy as they\\nwalked up the stairs togetherfor the middletons arrived\\nso directly after mrs jennings that they all followed\\nthe servant at the same timethere is nobody here but\\nyou that can feel for mei declare i can hardly stand\\ngood graciousin a moment i shall see the person that all\\nmy happiness depends onthat is to be my mother\\n\\nelinor could have given her immediate relief\\nby suggesting the possibility of its being miss mortons mother\\nrather than her own whom they were about to behold\\nbut instead of doing that she assured her and with\\ngreat sincerity that she did pity herto the utter\\namazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable herself\\nhoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor\\n\\nmrs ferrars was a little thin woman upright\\neven to formality in her figure and serious\\neven to sourness in her aspect  her complexion was sallow\\nand her features small without beauty and naturally\\nwithout expression but a lucky contraction of the brow\\nhad rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity\\nby giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature\\nshe was not a woman of many words for unlike people\\nin general she proportioned them to the number of\\nher ideas and of the few syllables that did escape her\\nnot one fell to the share of miss dashwood whom she eyed\\nwith the spirited determination of disliking her at all events\\n\\nelinor could not now be made unhappy by this behaviour\\na few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly but it\\nwas not in mrs ferrars power to distress her by it now\\nand the difference of her manners to the miss steeles\\na difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more\\nonly amused her  she could not but smile to see the graciousness\\nof both mother and daughter towards the very person\\nfor lucy was particularly distinguishedwhom of all others\\nhad they known as much as she did they would have been most\\nanxious to mortify while she herself who had comparatively\\nno power to wound them sat pointedly slighted by both\\nbut while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied\\nshe could not reflect on the meanspirited folly from\\nwhich it sprung nor observe the studied attentions\\nwith which the miss steeles courted its continuance\\nwithout thoroughly despising them all four\\n\\nlucy was all exultation on being so honorably\\ndistinguished and miss steele wanted only to be teazed\\nabout dr davies to be perfectly happy\\n\\nthe dinner was a grand one the servants were numerous\\nand every thing bespoke the mistresss inclination\\nfor show and the masters ability to support it\\nin spite of the improvements and additions which were\\nmaking to the norland estate and in spite of its owner\\nhaving once been within some thousand pounds of being\\nobliged to sell out at a loss nothing gave any symptom\\nof that indigence which he had tried to infer from it\\nno poverty of any kind except of conversation appeared\\nbut there the deficiency was considerable  john dashwood\\nhad not much to say for himself that was worth hearing\\nand his wife had still less  but there was no peculiar\\ndisgrace in this for it was very much the case with\\nthe chief of their visitors who almost all laboured\\nunder one or other of these disqualifications for being\\nagreeablewant of sense either natural or improvedwant\\nof elegancewant of spiritsor want of temper\\n\\nwhen the ladies withdrew to the drawingroom\\nafter dinner this poverty was particularly evident\\nfor the gentlemen had supplied the discourse with some\\nvarietythe variety of politics inclosing land\\nand breaking horsesbut then it was all over and one\\nsubject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in\\nwhich was the comparative heights of harry dashwood\\nand lady middletons second son william who were nearly\\nof the same age\\n\\nhad both the children been there the affair might\\nhave been determined too easily by measuring them at once\\nbut as harry only was present it was all conjectural\\nassertion on both sides and every body had a right to\\nbe equally positive in their opinion and to repeat it\\nover and over again as often as they liked\\n\\nthe parties stood thus\\n\\nthe two mothers though each really convinced that\\nher own son was the tallest politely decided in favour\\nof the other\\n\\nthe two grandmothers with not less partiality\\nbut more sincerity were equally earnest in support\\nof their own descendant\\n\\nlucy who was hardly less anxious to please one parent\\nthan the other thought the boys were both remarkably tall\\nfor their age and could not conceive that there could\\nbe the smallest difference in the world between them\\nand miss steele with yet greater address gave it\\nas fast as she could in favour of each\\n\\nelinor having once delivered her opinion on\\nwilliams side by which she offended mrs ferrars and\\nfanny still more did not see the necessity of enforcing\\nit by any farther assertion and marianne when called\\non for hers offended them all by declaring that she\\nhad no opinion to give as she had never thought about it\\n\\nbefore her removing from norland elinor had painted\\na very pretty pair of screens for her sisterinlaw\\nwhich being now just mounted and brought home\\nornamented her present drawing room and these screens\\ncatching the eye of john dashwood on his following\\nthe other gentlemen into the room were officiously\\nhanded by him to colonel brandon for his admiration\\n\\nthese are done by my eldest sister said he and you\\nas a man of taste will i dare say be pleased with them\\ni do not know whether you have ever happened to see any\\nof her performances before but she is in general reckoned\\nto draw extremely well\\n\\nthe colonel though disclaiming all pretensions\\nto connoisseurship warmly admired the screens as he\\nwould have done any thing painted by miss dashwood\\nand on the curiosity of the others being of course excited\\nthey were handed round for general inspection\\nmrs ferrars not aware of their being elinors work\\nparticularly requested to look at them and after they had\\nreceived gratifying testimony of lady middletonss approbation\\nfanny presented them to her mother considerately informing\\nher at the same time that they were done by miss dashwood\\n\\nhumsaid mrs ferrarsvery prettyand without\\nregarding them at all returned them to her daughter\\n\\nperhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother\\nhad been quite rude enoughfor colouring a little\\nshe immediately said\\n\\nthey are very pretty maamant they but then again\\nthe dread of having been too civil too encouraging herself\\nprobably came over her for she presently added\\n\\ndo you not think they are something in miss\\nmortons style of painting maamshe does paint most\\ndelightfullyhow beautifully her last landscape is done\\n\\nbeautifully indeed  but she does every thing well\\n\\nmarianne could not bear thisshe was already\\ngreatly displeased with mrs ferrars and such illtimed\\npraise of another at elinors expense though she\\nhad not any notion of what was principally meant by it\\nprovoked her immediately to say with warmth\\n\\nthis is admiration of a very particular kind\\nwhat is miss morton to uswho knows or who cares\\nfor herit is elinor of whom we think and speak\\n\\nand so saying she took the screens out of her\\nsisterinlaws hands to admire them herself as they\\nought to be admired\\n\\nmrs ferrars looked exceedingly angry and drawing\\nherself up more stiffly than ever pronounced in retort\\nthis bitter philippic miss morton is lord mortons daughter\\n\\nfanny looked very angry too and her husband was\\nall in a fright at his sisters audacity  elinor was\\nmuch more hurt by mariannes warmth than she had been\\nby what produced it but colonel brandons eyes as they\\nwere fixed on marianne declared that he noticed only\\nwhat was amiable in it the affectionate heart which could\\nnot bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point\\n\\nmariannes feelings did not stop here  the cold\\ninsolence of mrs ferrarss general behaviour to her sister\\nseemed to her to foretell such difficulties and distresses\\nto elinor as her own wounded heart taught her to think\\nof with horror and urged by a strong impulse of\\naffectionate sensibility she moved after a moment\\nto her sisters chair and putting one arm round her neck\\nand one cheek close to hers said in a low but eager\\nvoice\\n\\ndear dear elinor dont mind them  dont let them\\nmake you unhappy\\n\\nshe could say no more her spirits were quite overcome\\nand hiding her face on elinors shoulder she burst\\ninto tears  every bodys attention was called and almost\\nevery body was concernedcolonel brandon rose up and went\\nto them without knowing what he didmrs jennings\\nwith a very intelligent ah poor dear immediately gave\\nher her salts and sir john felt so desperately enraged\\nagainst the author of this nervous distress that he\\ninstantly changed his seat to one close by lucy steele\\nand gave her in a whisper a brief account of the whole\\nshocking affair\\n\\nin a few minutes however marianne was recovered\\nenough to put an end to the bustle and sit down among\\nthe rest though her spirits retained the impression\\nof what had passed the whole evening\\n\\npoor marianne said her brother to colonel brandon\\nin a low voice as soon as he could secure his attention\\nshe has not such good health as her sistershe is very\\nnervousshe has not elinors constitutionand one must\\nallow that there is something very trying to a young woman\\nwho has been a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions\\nyou would not think it perhaps but marianne was remarkably\\nhandsome a few months ago quite as handsome as elinor\\nnow you see it is all gone\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 35\\n\\n\\nelinors curiosity to see mrs ferrars was satisfied\\nshe had found in her every thing that could tend to make\\na farther connection between the families undesirable\\nshe had seen enough of her pride her meanness and her\\ndetermined prejudice against herself to comprehend all\\nthe difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement\\nand retarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been\\notherwise freeand she had seen almost enough to be thankful\\nfor her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her\\nfrom suffering under any other of mrs ferrarss creation\\npreserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or any\\nsolicitude for her good opinion  or at least if she did not\\nbring herself quite to rejoice in edwards being fettered\\nto lucy she determined that had lucy been more amiable\\nshe ought to have rejoiced\\n\\nshe wondered that lucys spirits could be so very much\\nelevated by the civility of mrs ferrarsthat her interest\\nand her vanity should so very much blind her as to make\\nthe attention which seemed only paid her because she was\\nnot elinor appear a compliment to herselfor to allow\\nher to derive encouragement from a preference only given her\\nbecause her real situation was unknown  but that it was so\\nhad not only been declared by lucys eyes at the time\\nbut was declared over again the next morning more openly\\nfor at her particular desire lady middleton set her down\\nin berkeley street on the chance of seeing elinor alone\\nto tell her how happy she was\\n\\nthe chance proved a lucky one for a message from\\nmrs palmer soon after she arrived carried mrs jennings away\\n\\nmy dear friend cried lucy as soon as they were\\nby themselves i come to talk to you of my happiness\\ncould anything be so flattering as mrs ferrarss way\\nof treating me yesterday  so exceeding affable as she\\nwasyou know how i dreaded the thoughts of seeing her\\nbut the very moment i was introduced there was such an\\naffability in her behaviour as really should seem to say\\nshe had quite took a fancy to me  now was not it so\\nyou saw it all and was not you quite struck with it\\n\\nshe was certainly very civil to you\\n\\ncivildid you see nothing but only civility\\ni saw a vast deal more  such kindness as fell to the share\\nof nobody but meno pride no hauteur and your sister\\njust the sameall sweetness and affability\\n\\nelinor wished to talk of something else but lucy still\\npressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness\\nand elinor was obliged to go on\\n\\nundoubtedly if they had known your engagement\\nsaid she nothing could be more flattering than their\\ntreatment of youbut as that was not the case\\n\\ni guessed you would say soreplied lucy\\nquicklybut there was no reason in the world why\\nmrs ferrars should seem to like me if she did not\\nand her liking me is every thing  you shant talk me\\nout of my satisfaction  i am sure it will all end well\\nand there will be no difficulties at all to what i\\nused to think  mrs ferrars is a charming woman\\nand so is your sister  they are both delightful women\\nindeedi wonder i should never hear you say how agreeable\\nmrs dashwood was\\n\\nto this elinor had no answer to make and did not\\nattempt any\\n\\nare you ill miss dashwoodyou seem lowyou\\ndont speaksure you ant well\\n\\ni never was in better health\\n\\ni am glad of it with all my heart but really you did\\nnot look it  i should be sorry to have you ill you that have\\nbeen the greatest comfort to me in the worldheaven\\nknows what i should have done without your friendship\\n\\nelinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting\\nher own success  but it seemed to satisfy lucy for she\\ndirectly replied\\n\\nindeed i am perfectly convinced of your regard\\nfor me and next to edwards love it is the greatest\\ncomfort i havepoor edwardbut now there is one\\ngood thing we shall be able to meet and meet pretty often\\nfor lady middletons delighted with mrs dashwood\\nso we shall be a good deal in harley street i dare say\\nand edward spends half his time with his sisterbesides\\nlady middleton and mrs ferrars will visit now\\nand mrs ferrars and your sister were both so good to say\\nmore than once they should always be glad to see me\\nthey are such charming womeni am sure if ever you\\ntell your sister what i think of her you cannot speak\\ntoo high\\n\\nbut elinor would not give her any encouragement\\nto hope that she should tell her sister  lucy continued\\n\\ni am sure i should have seen it in a moment\\nif mrs ferrars had took a dislike to me  if she had only\\nmade me a formal courtesy for instance without saying\\na word and never after had took any notice of me\\nand never looked at me in a pleasant wayyou know\\nwhat i meanif i had been treated in that forbidding\\nsort of way i should have gave it all up in despair\\ni could not have stood it  for where she does dislike\\ni know it is most violent\\n\\nelinor was prevented from making any reply to this\\ncivil triumph by the doors being thrown open the servants\\nannouncing mr ferrars and edwards immediately walking in\\n\\nit was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each\\nshewed that it was so  they all looked exceedingly foolish\\nand edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk\\nout of the room again as to advance farther into it\\nthe very circumstance in its unpleasantest form\\nwhich they would each have been most anxious to avoid\\nhad fallen on themthey were not only all three together\\nbut were together without the relief of any other person\\nthe ladies recovered themselves first  it was not lucys\\nbusiness to put herself forward and the appearance of\\nsecrecy must still be kept up  she could therefore only\\nlook her tenderness and after slightly addressing him\\nsaid no more\\n\\nbut elinor had more to do and so anxious was she\\nfor his sake and her own to do it well that she\\nforced herself after a moments recollection\\nto welcome him with a look and manner that were almost easy\\nand almost open and another struggle another effort still\\nimproved them  she would not allow the presence of lucy\\nnor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself\\nto deter her from saying that she was happy to see him\\nand that she had very much regretted being from home\\nwhen he called before in berkeley street  she would\\nnot be frightened from paying him those attentions which\\nas a friend and almost a relation were his due by the\\nobservant eyes of lucy though she soon perceived them\\nto be narrowly watching her\\n\\nher manners gave some reassurance to edward and he\\nhad courage enough to sit down but his embarrassment still\\nexceeded that of the ladies in a proportion which the case\\nrendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare\\nfor his heart had not the indifference of lucys nor\\ncould his conscience have quite the ease of elinors\\n\\nlucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined\\nto make no contribution to the comfort of the others\\nand would not say a word and almost every thing that was\\nsaid proceeded from elinor who was obliged to volunteer\\nall the information about her mothers health their coming\\nto town c which edward ought to have inquired about\\nbut never did\\n\\nher exertions did not stop here for she soon\\nafterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as\\nto determine under pretence of fetching marianne\\nto leave the others by themselves and she really did it\\nand that in the handsomest manner for she loitered away\\nseveral minutes on the landingplace with the most\\nhighminded fortitude before she went to her sister\\nwhen that was once done however it was time for the raptures\\nof edward to cease for mariannes joy hurried her into\\nthe drawingroom immediately  her pleasure in seeing him\\nwas like every other of her feelings strong in itself\\nand strongly spoken  she met him with a hand that would\\nbe taken and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister\\n\\ndear edward she cried this is a moment of great\\nhappinessthis would almost make amends for every thing\\n\\nedward tried to return her kindness as it deserved\\nbut before such witnesses he dared not say half what he\\nreally felt  again they all sat down and for a moment\\nor two all were silent while marianne was looking with the\\nmost speaking tenderness sometimes at edward and sometimes\\nat elinor regretting only that their delight in each\\nother should be checked by lucys unwelcome presence\\nedward was the first to speak and it was to notice\\nmariannes altered looks and express his fear of her\\nnot finding london agree with her\\n\\noh dont think of me she replied with spirited\\nearnestness though her eyes were filled with tears\\nas she spoke dont think of my health  elinor is well\\nyou see  that must be enough for us both\\n\\nthis remark was not calculated to make edward or\\nelinor more easy nor to conciliate the good will of lucy\\nwho looked up at marianne with no very benignant expression\\n\\ndo you like london said edward willing to say\\nany thing that might introduce another subject\\n\\nnot at all  i expected much pleasure in it\\nbut i have found none  the sight of you edward is the\\nonly comfort it has afforded and thank heaven you\\nare what you always were\\n\\nshe pausedno one spoke\\n\\ni think elinor she presently added we must\\nemploy edward to take care of us in our return to barton\\nin a week or two i suppose we shall be going and i trust\\nedward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge\\n\\npoor edward muttered something but what it was\\nnobody knew not even himself  but marianne who saw\\nhis agitation and could easily trace it to whatever\\ncause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied\\nand soon talked of something else\\n\\nwe spent such a day edward in harley street\\nyesterday  so dull so wretchedly dullbut i have much\\nto say to you on that head which cannot be said now\\n\\nand with this admirable discretion did she defer\\nthe assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more\\ndisagreeable than ever and of her being particularly\\ndisgusted with his mother till they were more in private\\n\\nbut why were you not there edwardwhy did you\\nnot come\\n\\ni was engaged elsewhere\\n\\nengaged  but what was that when such friends\\nwere to be met\\n\\nperhaps miss marianne cried lucy eager to take\\nsome revenge on her you think young men never stand\\nupon engagements if they have no mind to keep them\\nlittle as well as great\\n\\nelinor was very angry but marianne seemed entirely\\ninsensible of the sting for she calmly replied\\n\\nnot so indeed for seriously speaking i am very\\nsure that conscience only kept edward from harley street\\nand i really believe he has the most delicate conscience\\nin the world the most scrupulous in performing\\nevery engagement however minute and however it\\nmay make against his interest or pleasure  he is the\\nmost fearful of giving pain of wounding expectation\\nand the most incapable of being selfish of any body\\ni ever saw  edward it is so and i will say it\\nwhat are you never to hear yourself praisedthen you\\nmust be no friend of mine for those who will accept\\nof my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation\\n\\nthe nature of her commendation in the present case\\nhowever happened to be particularly illsuited to the\\nfeelings of two thirds of her auditors and was so very\\nunexhilarating to edward that he very soon got up to go away\\n\\ngoing so soon said marianne my dear edward\\nthis must not be\\n\\nand drawing him a little aside she whispered\\nher persuasion that lucy could not stay much longer\\nbut even this encouragement failed for he would go\\nand lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted\\ntwo hours soon afterwards went away\\n\\nwhat can bring her here so often said marianne\\non her leaving them  could not she see that we wanted\\nher gonehow teazing to edward\\n\\nwhy sowe were all his friends and lucy has been\\nthe longest known to him of any  it is but natural\\nthat he should like to see her as well as ourselves\\n\\nmarianne looked at her steadily and said you know\\nelinor that this is a kind of talking which i cannot bear\\nif you only hope to have your assertion contradicted\\nas i must suppose to be the case you ought to recollect\\nthat i am the last person in the world to do it\\ni cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances that are\\nnot really wanted\\n\\nshe then left the room and elinor dared not follow\\nher to say more for bound as she was by her promise\\nof secrecy to lucy she could give no information that\\nwould convince marianne and painful as the consequences\\nof her still continuing in an error might be she was\\nobliged to submit to it  all that she could hope was\\nthat edward would not often expose her or himself to the\\ndistress of hearing mariannes mistaken warmth nor to the\\nrepetition of any other part of the pain that had attended\\ntheir recent meetingand this she had every reason to expect\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 36\\n\\n\\nwithin a few days after this meeting the newspapers\\nannounced to the world that the lady of thomas palmer\\nesq was safely delivered of a son and heir a very\\ninteresting and satisfactory paragraph at least to all\\nthose intimate connections who knew it before\\n\\nthis event highly important to mrs jenningss happiness\\nproduced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time\\nand influenced in a like degree the engagements\\nof her young friends for as she wished to be as much\\nas possible with charlotte she went thither every morning\\nas soon as she was dressed and did not return till late\\nin the evening and the miss dashwoods at the particular\\nrequest of the middletons spent the whole of every day\\nin every day in conduit street  for their own comfort\\nthey would much rather have remained at least all\\nthe morning in mrs jenningss house but it was not\\na thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody\\ntheir hours were therefore made over to lady middleton\\nand the two miss steeles by whom their company in fact\\nwas as little valued as it was professedly sought\\n\\nthey had too much sense to be desirable companions\\nto the former and by the latter they were considered with\\na jealous eye as intruding on their ground and sharing\\nthe kindness which they wanted to monopolize  though nothing\\ncould be more polite than lady middletons behaviour to\\nelinor and marianne she did not really like them at all\\nbecause they neither flattered herself nor her children\\nshe could not believe them goodnatured and because they\\nwere fond of reading she fancied them satirical perhaps\\nwithout exactly knowing what it was to be satirical\\nbut that did not signify  it was censure in common use\\nand easily given\\n\\ntheir presence was a restraint both on her and on lucy\\nit checked the idleness of one and the business of the other\\nlady middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them\\nand the flattery which lucy was proud to think of\\nand administer at other times she feared they would despise\\nher for offering  miss steele was the least discomposed\\nof the three by their presence and it was in their power\\nto reconcile her to it entirely  would either of them\\nonly have given her a full and minute account of the whole\\naffair between marianne and mr willoughby she would\\nhave thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice\\nof the best place by the fire after dinner which their\\narrival occasioned  but this conciliation was not granted\\nfor though she often threw out expressions of pity for her\\nsister to elinor and more than once dropt a reflection\\non the inconstancy of beaux before marianne no effect\\nwas produced but a look of indifference from the former\\nor of disgust in the latter  an effort even yet lighter\\nmight have made her their friend  would they only have\\nlaughed at her about the doctor  but so little were they\\nanymore than the others inclined to oblige her\\nthat if sir john dined from home she might spend a whole\\nday without hearing any other raillery on the subject\\nthan what she was kind enough to bestow on herself\\n\\nall these jealousies and discontents however were so\\ntotally unsuspected by mrs jennings that she thought\\nit a delightful thing for the girls to be together\\nand generally congratulated her young friends every night\\non having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long\\nshe joined them sometimes at sir johns sometimes\\nat her own house but wherever it was she always came\\nin excellent spirits full of delight and importance\\nattributing charlottes well doing to her own care and ready\\nto give so exact so minute a detail of her situation\\nas only miss steele had curiosity enough to desire\\none thing did disturb her and of that she made her\\ndaily complaint  mr palmer maintained the common\\nbut unfatherly opinion among his sex of all infants being alike\\nand though she could plainly perceive at different times\\nthe most striking resemblance between this baby and every\\none of his relations on both sides there was no convincing\\nhis father of it no persuading him to believe that it\\nwas not exactly like every other baby of the same age\\nnor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple\\nproposition of its being the finest child in the world\\n\\ni come now to the relation of a misfortune\\nwhich about this time befell mrs john dashwood\\nit so happened that while her two sisters with\\nmrs jennings were first calling on her in harley street\\nanother of her acquaintance had dropt ina circumstance\\nin itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her\\nbut while the imaginations of other people will carry\\nthem away to form wrong judgments of our conduct\\nand to decide on it by slight appearances ones happiness\\nmust in some measure be always at the mercy of chance\\nin the present instance this lastarrived lady allowed\\nher fancy to so far outrun truth and probability\\nthat on merely hearing the name of the miss dashwoods\\nand understanding them to be mr dashwoods sisters\\nshe immediately concluded them to be staying in harley street\\nand this misconstruction produced within a day\\nor two afterwards cards of invitation for them\\nas well as for their brother and sister to a small\\nmusical party at her house  the consequence of which was\\nthat mrs john dashwood was obliged to submit not only\\nto the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her\\ncarriage for the miss dashwoods but what was still worse\\nmust be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing\\nto treat them with attention and who could tell that they\\nmight not expect to go out with her a second time  the power\\nof disappointing them it was true must always be hers\\nbut that was not enough for when people are determined\\non a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel\\ninjured by the expectation of any thing better from them\\n\\nmarianne had now been brought by degrees so much\\ninto the habit of going out every day that it was become\\na matter of indifference to her whether she went or not\\nand she prepared quietly and mechanically for every\\nevenings engagement though without expecting the smallest\\namusement from any and very often without knowing\\ntill the last moment where it was to take her\\n\\nto her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly\\nindifferent as not to bestow half the consideration on it\\nduring the whole of her toilet which it received from\\nmiss steele in the first five minutes of their being\\ntogether when it was finished  nothing escaped her minute\\nobservation and general curiosity she saw every thing\\nand asked every thing was never easy till she knew the price\\nof every part of mariannes dress could have guessed the\\nnumber of her gowns altogether with better judgment than\\nmarianne herself and was not without hopes of finding out\\nbefore they parted how much her washing cost per week\\nand how much she had every year to spend upon herself\\nthe impertinence of these kind of scrutinies moreover\\nwas generally concluded with a compliment which\\nthough meant as its douceur was considered by marianne\\nas the greatest impertinence of all for after undergoing\\nan examination into the value and make of her gown\\nthe colour of her shoes and the arrangement of her hair\\nshe was almost sure of being told that upon her word\\nshe looked vastly smart and she dared to say she would\\nmake a great many conquests\\n\\nwith such encouragement as this was she dismissed\\non the present occasion to her brothers carriage\\nwhich they were ready to enter five minutes after it\\nstopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable\\nto their sisterinlaw who had preceded them to the house\\nof her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay\\non their part that might inconvenience either herself\\nor her coachman\\n\\nthe events of this evening were not very remarkable\\nthe party like other musical parties comprehended a\\ngreat many people who had real taste for the performance\\nand a great many more who had none at all and the performers\\nthemselves were as usual in their own estimation\\nand that of their immediate friends the first private\\nperformers in england\\n\\nas elinor was neither musical nor affecting to be so\\nshe made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand\\npianoforte whenever it suited her and unrestrained even\\nby the presence of a harp and violoncello would fix\\nthem at pleasure on any other object in the room  in one\\nof these excursive glances she perceived among a group\\nof young men the very he who had given them a lecture\\non toothpickcases at grays  she perceived him soon\\nafterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly\\nto her brother and had just determined to find out his\\nname from the latter when they both came towards her\\nand mr dashwood introduced him to her as mr robert ferrars\\n\\nhe addressed her with easy civility and twisted\\nhis head into a bow which assured her as plainly as\\nwords could have done that he was exactly the coxcomb\\nshe had heard him described to be by lucy  happy had\\nit been for her if her regard for edward had depended\\nless on his own merit than on the merit of his nearest\\nrelations  for then his brothers bow must have given\\nthe finishing stroke to what the illhumour of his mother\\nand sister would have begun  but while she wondered\\nat the difference of the two young men she did not find\\nthat the emptiness of conceit of the one put her out\\nof all charity with the modesty and worth of the other\\nwhy they were different robert exclaimed to her himself\\nin the course of a quarter of an hours conversation\\nfor talking of his brother and lamenting the extreme\\ngaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing\\nin proper society he candidly and generously attributed it\\nmuch less to any natural deficiency than to the misfortune\\nof a private education while he himself though probably\\nwithout any particular any material superiority\\nby nature merely from the advantage of a public school\\nwas as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man\\n\\nupon my soul he added i believe it is nothing more\\nand so i often tell my mother when she is grieving\\nabout it  my dear madam i always say to her you must\\nmake yourself easy  the evil is now irremediable\\nand it has been entirely your own doing  why would\\nyou be persuaded by my uncle sir robert against your\\nown judgment to place edward under private tuition\\nat the most critical time of his life  if you had only sent\\nhim to westminster as well as myself instead of sending\\nhim to mr pratts all this would have been prevented\\nthis is the way in which i always consider the matter\\nand my mother is perfectly convinced of her error\\n\\nelinor would not oppose his opinion because\\nwhatever might be her general estimation of the advantage\\nof a public school she could not think of edwards\\nabode in mr pratts family with any satisfaction\\n\\nyou reside in devonshire i thinkwas his\\nnext observation in a cottage near dawlish\\n\\nelinor set him right as to its situation\\nand it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody\\ncould live in devonshire without living near dawlish\\nhe bestowed his hearty approbation however on their\\nspecies of house\\n\\nfor my own part said he i am excessively fond\\nof a cottage there is always so much comfort so much\\nelegance about them  and i protest if i had any money\\nto spare i should buy a little land and build one myself\\nwithin a short distance of london where i might drive\\nmyself down at any time and collect a few friends\\nabout me and be happy  i advise every body who is going\\nto build to build a cottage  my friend lord courtland\\ncame to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice\\nand laid before me three different plans of bonomis\\ni was to decide on the best of them  my dear courtland\\nsaid i immediately throwing them all into the fire do not\\nadopt either of them but by all means build a cottage\\nand that i fancy will be the end of it\\n\\nsome people imagine that there can be no accommodations\\nno space in a cottage but this is all a mistake\\ni was last month at my friend elliotts near dartford\\nlady elliott wished to give a dance  but how can it\\nbe done said she my dear ferrars do tell me how it\\nis to be managed  there is not a room in this cottage\\nthat will hold ten couple and where can the supper be\\ni immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it\\nso i said my dear lady elliott do not be uneasy\\nthe dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease\\ncardtables may be placed in the drawingroom the library\\nmay be open for tea and other refreshments and let the\\nsupper be set out in the saloon  lady elliott was delighted\\nwith the thought  we measured the diningroom and found\\nit would hold exactly eighteen couple and the affair\\nwas arranged precisely after my plan  so that in fact\\nyou see if people do but know how to set about it\\nevery comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage\\nas in the most spacious dwelling\\n\\nelinor agreed to it all for she did not think\\nhe deserved the compliment of rational opposition\\n\\nas john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his\\neldest sister his mind was equally at liberty to fix on\\nany thing else and a thought struck him during the evening\\nwhich he communicated to his wife for her approbation\\nwhen they got home  the consideration of mrs dennisons\\nmistake\\nin supposing his sisters their guests had suggested the\\npropriety of their being really invited to become such\\nwhile mrs jennings engagements kept her from home\\nthe expense would be nothing the inconvenience not more\\nand it was altogether an attention which the delicacy\\nof his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its\\ncomplete enfranchisement from his promise to his father\\nfanny was startled at the proposal\\n\\ni do not see how it can be done said she\\nwithout affronting lady middleton for they spend every day\\nwith her otherwise i should be exceedingly glad to do it\\nyou know i am always ready to pay them any attention\\nin my power as my taking them out this evening shews\\nbut they are lady middletons visitors  how can i ask them\\naway from her\\n\\nher husband but with great humility did not see\\nthe force of her objection  they had already spent a week\\nin this manner in conduit street and lady middleton\\ncould not be displeased at their giving the same number\\nof days to such near relations\\n\\nfanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said\\n\\nmy love i would ask them with all my heart if it\\nwas in my power  but i had just settled within myself\\nto ask the miss steeles to spend a few days with us\\nthey are very well behaved good kind of girls and i think\\nthe attention is due to them as their uncle did so very\\nwell by edward  we can ask your sisters some other year\\nyou know but the miss steeles may not be in town any more\\ni am sure you will like them indeed you do like them\\nyou know very much already and so does my mother and they\\nare such favourites with harry\\n\\nmr dashwood was convinced  he saw the necessity\\nof inviting the miss steeles immediately and his conscience\\nwas pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters\\nanother year at the same time however slyly suspecting\\nthat another year would make the invitation needless\\nby bringing elinor to town as colonel brandons wife\\nand marianne as their visitor\\n\\nfanny rejoicing in her escape and proud of the ready\\nwit that had procured it wrote the next morning to lucy\\nto request her company and her sisters for some days\\nin harley street as soon as lady middleton could spare them\\nthis was enough to make lucy really and reasonably happy\\nmrs dashwood seemed actually working for her herself\\ncherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views\\nsuch an opportunity of being with edward and his family was\\nabove all things the most material to her interest\\nand such an invitation the most gratifying to her\\nfeelings  it was an advantage that could not be too\\ngratefully acknowledged nor too speedily made use of\\nand the visit to lady middleton which had not before had\\nany precise limits was instantly discovered to have been\\nalways meant to end in two days time\\n\\nwhen the note was shown to elinor as it was within ten\\nminutes after its arrival it gave her for the first time\\nsome share in the expectations of lucy for such a mark\\nof uncommon kindness vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance\\nseemed to declare that the goodwill towards her arose\\nfrom something more than merely malice against herself\\nand might be brought by time and address to do\\nevery thing that lucy wished  her flattery had already\\nsubdued the pride of lady middleton and made an entry\\ninto the close heart of mrs john dashwood and these\\nwere effects that laid open the probability of greater\\n\\nthe miss steeles removed to harley street and all\\nthat reached elinor of their influence there strengthened\\nher expectation of the event  sir john who called on\\nthem more than once brought home such accounts of the\\nfavour they were in as must be universally striking\\nmrs dashwood had never been so much pleased with any\\nyoung women in her life as she was with them had given\\neach of them a needle book made by some emigrant\\ncalled lucy by her christian name and did not know\\nwhether she should ever be able to part with them\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nat this point in the first and second edtions volume ii ended\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 37\\n\\n\\nmrs palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight\\nthat her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up\\nthe whole of her time to her and contenting herself with\\nvisiting her once or twice a day returned from that period\\nto her own home and her own habits in which she found\\nthe miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share\\n\\nabout the third or fourth morning after their\\nbeing thus resettled in berkeley street mrs jennings\\non returning from her ordinary visit to mrs palmer\\nentered the drawingroom where elinor was sitting\\nby herself with an air of such hurrying importance\\nas prepared her to hear something wonderful and giving her\\ntime only to form that idea began directly to justify it\\nby saying\\n\\nlord my dear miss dashwood have you heard the news\\n\\nno maam  what is it\\n\\nsomething so strange  but you shall hear it all\\nwhen i got to mr palmers i found charlotte quite\\nin a fuss about the child  she was sure it was very\\nillit cried and fretted and was all over pimples\\nso i looked at it directly and lord my dear\\nsays i it is nothing in the world but the red gum\\nand nurse said just the same  but charlotte she would\\nnot be satisfied so mr donavan was sent for and luckily\\nhe happened to just come in from harley street so he\\nstepped over directly and as soon as ever he saw the child\\nbe said just as we did that it was nothing in the world\\nbut the red gum and then charlotte was easy  and so\\njust as he was going away again it came into my head\\ni am sure i do not know how i happened to think of it\\nbut it came into my head to ask him if there was any news\\nso upon that he smirked and simpered and looked grave\\nand seemed to know something or other and at last he\\nsaid in a whisper for fear any unpleasant report\\nshould reach the young ladies under your care as to their\\nsisters indisposition i think it advisable to say\\nthat i believe there is no great reason for alarm i hope\\nmrs dashwood will do very well\\n\\nwhat is fanny ill\\n\\nthat is exactly what i said my dear  lord says i\\nis mrs dashwood ill so then it all came out and the\\nlong and the short of the matter by all i can learn\\nseems to be this  mr edward ferrars the very young\\nman i used to joke with you about but however as it\\nturns out i am monstrous glad there was never any thing\\nin it mr edward ferrars it seems has been engaged\\nabove this twelvemonth to my cousin lucytheres for you\\nmy dearand not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter\\nexcept nancycould you have believed such a thing possible\\nthere is no great wonder in their liking one another\\nbut that matters should be brought so forward between them\\nand nobody suspect itthat is strangei never happened\\nto see them together or i am sure i should have found it\\nout directly  well and so this was kept a great secret\\nfor fear of mrs ferrars and neither she nor your\\nbrother or sister suspected a word of the matter\\ntill this very morning poor nancy who you know is a\\nwellmeaning creature but no conjurer popt it all out\\nlord thinks she to herself they are all so fond\\nof lucy to be sure they will make no difficulty about it\\nand so away she went to your sister who was sitting all\\nalone at her carpetwork little suspecting what was to\\ncomefor she had just been saying to your brother only five\\nminutes before that she thought to make a match between\\nedward and some lords daughter or other i forget who\\nso you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity\\nand pride  she fell into violent hysterics immediately\\nwith such screams as reached your brothers ears\\nas he was sitting in his own dressingroom down stairs\\nthinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country\\nso up he flew directly and a terrible scene took place\\nfor lucy was come to them by that time little dreaming\\nwhat was going on  poor soul  i pity her  and i must say\\ni think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded\\nlike any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit\\nnancy she fell upon her knees and cried bitterly\\nand your brother he walked about the room and said\\nhe did not know what to do  mrs dashwood declared\\nthey should not stay a minute longer in the house\\nand your brother was forced to go down upon his knees too\\nto persuade her to let them stay till they had packed\\nup their clothes  then she fell into hysterics again\\nand he was so frightened that he would send for mr donavan\\nand mr donavan found the house in all this uproar\\nthe carriage was at the door ready to take my poor\\ncousins away and they were just stepping in as he\\ncame off poor lucy in such a condition he says\\nshe could hardly walk and nancy she was almost as bad\\ni declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope\\nwith all my heart it will be a match in spite of her\\nlord what a taking poor mr edward will be in when he\\nhears of it  to have his love used so scornfully for\\nthey say he is monstrous fond of her as well he may\\ni should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest\\npassionand mr donavan thinks just the same  he and i\\nhad a great deal of talk about it and the best of all is\\nthat he is gone back again to harley street that he may\\nbe within call when mrs ferrars is told of it for she\\nwas sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house\\nfor your sister was sure she would be in hysterics too\\nand so she may for what i care  i have no pity for\\neither of them  i have no notion of peoples making\\nsuch a todo about money and greatness  there is no\\nreason on earth why mr edward and lucy should not marry\\nfor i am sure mrs ferrars may afford to do very well\\nby her son and though lucy has next to nothing herself\\nshe knows better than any body how to make the most\\nof every thing i dare say if mrs ferrars would only\\nallow him five hundred ayear she would make as good\\nan appearance with it as any body else would with eight\\nlord how snug they might live in such another cottage\\nas yoursor a little biggerwith two maids and two men\\nand i believe i could help them to a housemaid for my\\nbetty has a sister out of place that would fit them\\nexactly\\n\\nhere mrs jennings ceased and as elinor had had\\ntime enough to collect her thoughts she was able\\nto give such an answer and make such observations\\nas the subject might naturally be supposed to produce\\nhappy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary\\ninterest in it that mrs jennings as she had of late\\noften hoped might be the case had ceased to imagine her\\nat all attached to edward and happy above all the rest\\nin the absence of marianne she felt very well able\\nto speak of the affair without embarrassment and to\\ngive her judgment as she believed with impartiality\\non the conduct of every one concerned in it\\n\\nshe could hardly determine what her own expectation\\nof its event really was though she earnestly tried\\nto drive away the notion of its being possible to end\\notherwise at last than in the marriage of edward and lucy\\nwhat mrs ferrars would say and do though there could\\nnot be a doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear\\nand still more anxious to know how edward would\\nconduct himself  for him she felt much compassion\\nfor lucy very littleand it cost her some pains to procure\\nthat littlefor the rest of the party none at all\\n\\nas mrs jennings could talk on no other subject\\nelinor soon saw the necessity of preparing marianne for\\nits discussion  no time was to be lost in undeceiving her\\nin making her acquainted with the real truth and in\\nendeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others\\nwithout betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister\\nor any resentment against edward\\n\\nelinors office was a painful oneshe was going\\nto remove what she really believed to be her sisters\\nchief consolationto give such particulars of edward as she\\nfeared would ruin him for ever in her good opinionand\\nto make marianne by a resemblance in their situations\\nwhich to her fancy would seem strong feel all her own\\ndisappointment over again  but unwelcome as such a task\\nmust be it was necessary to be done and elinor therefore\\nhastened to perform it\\n\\nshe was very far from wishing to dwell on her own\\nfeelings or to represent herself as suffering much\\nany otherwise than as the selfcommand she had practised\\nsince her first knowledge of edwards engagement might\\nsuggest a hint of what was practicable to marianne\\nher narration was clear and simple and though it could\\nnot be given without emotion it was not accompanied\\nby violent agitation nor impetuous griefthat belonged\\nrather to the hearer for marianne listened with horror\\nand cried excessively  elinor was to be the comforter\\nof others in her own distresses no less than in theirs\\nand all the comfort that could be given by assurances\\nof her own composure of mind and a very earnest\\nvindication of edward from every charge but of imprudence\\nwas readily offered\\n\\nbut marianne for some time would give credit to neither\\nedward seemed a second willoughby and acknowledging\\nas elinor did that she had loved him most sincerely\\ncould she feel less than herself  as for lucy steele\\nshe considered her so totally unamiable so absolutely\\nincapable of attaching a sensible man that she could\\nnot be persuaded at first to believe and afterwards\\nto pardon any former affection of edward for her\\nshe would not even admit it to have been natural\\nand elinor left her to be convinced that it was so\\nby that which only could convince her a better knowledge\\nof mankind\\n\\nher first communication had reached no farther than\\nto state the fact of the engagement and the length of time\\nit had existedmariannes feelings had then broken in\\nand put an end to all regularity of detail and for some\\ntime all that could be done was to soothe her distress\\nlessen her alarms and combat her resentment  the first\\nquestion on her side which led to farther particulars\\nwas\\n\\nhow long has this been known to you elinor has\\nhe written to you\\n\\ni have known it these four months  when lucy\\nfirst came to barton park last november she told me\\nin confidence of her engagement\\n\\nat these words mariannes eyes expressed the astonishment\\nwhich her lips could not utter  after a pause of wonder\\nshe exclaimed\\n\\nfour monthshave you known of this four months\\n\\nelinor confirmed it\\n\\nwhatwhile attending me in all my misery has this\\nbeen on your heartand i have reproached you for being\\nhappy\\n\\nit was not fit that you should then know how much\\ni was the reverse\\n\\nfour monthscried marianne againso calm\\nso cheerfulhow have you been supported\\n\\nby feeling that i was doing my dutymy promise to\\nlucy obliged me to be secret  i owed it to her therefore\\nto avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my\\nfamily and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me\\nwhich it could not be in my power to satisfy\\n\\nmarianne seemed much struck\\n\\ni have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my\\nmother added elinor and once or twice i have attempted it\\nbut without betraying my trust i never could have convinced\\nyou\\n\\nfour monthsand yet you loved him\\n\\nyes but i did not love only himand while the comfort\\nof others was dear to me i was glad to spare them from knowing\\nhow much i felt  now i can think and speak of it with\\nlittle emotion  i would not have you suffer on my account\\nfor i assure you i no longer suffer materially myself\\ni have many things to support me  i am not conscious of having\\nprovoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own\\ni have borne it as much as possible without spreading\\nit farther  i acquit edward of essential misconduct\\ni wish him very happy and i am so sure of his always\\ndoing his duty that though now he may harbour some regret\\nin the end he must become so  lucy does not want sense\\nand that is the foundation on which every thing good may\\nbe builtand after all marianne after all that is\\nbewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment\\nand all that can be said of ones happiness depending\\nentirely on any particular person it is not meantit\\nis not fitit is not possible that it should be so\\nedward will marry lucy he will marry a woman superior\\nin person and understanding to half her sex and time\\nand habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought\\nanother superior to her\\n\\nif such is your way of thinking said marianne\\nif the loss of what is most valued is so easily\\nto be made up by something else your resolution\\nyour selfcommand are perhaps a little less to be\\nwondered atthey are brought more within my comprehension\\n\\ni understand youyou do not suppose that i have ever\\nfelt muchfor four months marianne i have had all this\\nhanging on my mind without being at liberty to speak\\nof it to a single creature knowing that it would make\\nyou and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained\\nto you yet unable to prepare you for it in the least\\nit was told meit was in a manner forced on me by the\\nvery person herself whose prior engagement ruined all\\nmy prospects and told me as i thought with triumph\\nthis persons suspicions therefore i have had to oppose\\nby endeavouring to appear indifferent where i have been most\\ndeeply interestedand it has not been only oncei have\\nhad her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again\\ni have known myself to be divided from edward for ever\\nwithout hearing one circumstance that could make me less\\ndesire the connectionnothing has proved him unworthy\\nnor has anything declared him indifferent to me\\ni have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister\\nand the insolence of his mother and have suffered the\\npunishment of an attachment without enjoying its advantages\\nand all this has been going on at a time when as you\\nknow too well it has not been my only unhappiness\\nif you can think me capable of ever feelingsurely you\\nmay suppose that i have suffered now  the composure\\nof mind with which i have brought myself at present\\nto consider the matter the consolation that i have been\\nwilling to admit have been the effect of constant and\\npainful exertionthey did not spring up of themselves\\nthey did not occur to relieve my spirits at first\\nno mariannethen if i had not been bound to silence\\nperhaps nothing could have kept me entirelynot even what i\\nowed to my dearest friendsfrom openly shewing that i was\\nvery unhappy\\n\\nmarianne was quite subdued\\n\\noh elinor she cried you have made me hate\\nmyself for everhow barbarous have i been to you\\nyou who have been my only comfort who have borne with me\\nin all my misery who have seemed to be only suffering\\nfor meis this my gratitudeis this the only return i\\ncan make youbecause your merit cries out upon myself\\ni have been trying to do it away\\n\\nthe tenderest caresses followed this confession\\nin such a frame of mind as she was now in elinor had\\nno difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise\\nshe required and at her request marianne engaged\\nnever to speak of the affair to any one with the least\\nappearance of bitternessto meet lucy without betraying\\nthe smallest increase of dislike to herand even to see\\nedward himself if chance should bring them together\\nwithout any diminution of her usual cordiality\\nthese were great concessionsbut where marianne felt\\nthat she had injured no reparation could be too much\\nfor her to make\\n\\nshe performed her promise of being discreet\\nto admirationshe attended to all that mrs jennings\\nhad to say upon the subject with an unchanging complexion\\ndissented from her in nothing and was heard three\\ntimes to say yes maamshe listened to her praise\\nof lucy with only moving from one chair to another\\nand when mrs jennings talked of edwards affection\\nit cost her only a spasm in her throatsuch advances\\ntowards heroism in her sister made elinor feel equal\\nto any thing herself\\n\\nthe next morning brought a farther trial of it\\nin a visit from their brother who came with a most serious\\naspect to talk over the dreadful affair and bring them\\nnews of his wife\\n\\nyou have heard i suppose said he with great solemnity\\nas soon as he was seated of the very shocking discovery\\nthat took place under our roof yesterday\\n\\nthey all looked their assent it seemed too awful\\na moment for speech\\n\\nyour sister he continued has suffered dreadfully\\nmrs ferrars tooin short it has been a scene of such\\ncomplicated distressbut i will hope that the storm may\\nbe weathered without our being any of us quite overcome\\npoor fanny she was in hysterics all yesterday\\nbut i would not alarm you too much  donavan says there\\nis nothing materially to be apprehended her constitution\\nis a good one and her resolution equal to any thing\\nshe has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel\\nshe says she never shall think well of anybody again\\nand one cannot wonder at it after being so deceived\\nmeeting with such ingratitude where so much kindness\\nhad been shewn so much confidence had been placed  it\\nwas quite out of the benevolence of her heart that she\\nhad asked these young women to her house merely because\\nshe thought they deserved some attention were harmless\\nwellbehaved girls and would be pleasant companions\\nfor otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you\\nand marianne to be with us while your kind friend there\\nwas attending her daughter  and now to be so rewarded\\ni wish with all my heart says poor fanny in her\\naffectionate way that we had asked your sisters instead\\nof them\\n\\nhere he stopped to be thanked which being done\\nhe went on\\n\\nwhat poor mrs ferrars suffered when first fanny\\nbroke it to her is not to be described  while she with\\nthe truest affection had been planning a most eligible\\nconnection for him was it to be supposed that he could\\nbe all the time secretly engaged to another personsuch\\na suspicion could never have entered her head  if she\\nsuspected any prepossession elsewhere it could not be\\nin that quarter  there to be sure said she i might\\nhave thought myself safe she was quite in an agony\\nwe consulted together however as to what should be done\\nand at last she determined to send for edward\\nhe came  but i am sorry to relate what ensued\\nall that mrs ferrars could say to make him put an end\\nto the engagement assisted too as you may well suppose\\nby my arguments and fannys entreaties was of\\nno avail  duty affection every thing was disregarded\\ni never thought edward so stubborn so unfeeling before\\nhis mother explained to him her liberal designs in case\\nof his marrying miss morton told him she would settle on\\nhim the norfolk estate which clear of landtax brings\\nin a good thousand ayear offered even when matters\\ngrew desperate to make it twelve hundred and in opposition\\nto this if he still persisted in this low connection\\nrepresented to him the certain penury that must attend\\nthe match  his own two thousand pounds she protested\\nshould be his all she would never see him again and so far\\nwould she be from affording him the smallest assistance\\nthat if he were to enter into any profession with a view\\nof better support she would do all in her power to prevent\\nhim advancing in it\\n\\nhere marianne in an ecstasy of indignation\\nclapped her hands together and cried gracious god\\ncan this be possible\\n\\nwell may you wonder marianne replied her brother\\nat the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these\\nyour exclamation is very natural\\n\\nmarianne was going to retort but she remembered\\nher promises and forbore\\n\\nall this however he continued was urged in vain\\nedward said very little but what he did say was in\\nthe most determined manner  nothing should prevail on\\nhim to give up his engagement  he would stand to it\\ncost him what it might\\n\\nthen cried mrs jennings with blunt sincerity\\nno longer able to be silent he has acted like an honest\\nman i beg your pardon mr dashwood but if he had\\ndone otherwise i should have thought him a rascal\\ni have some little concern in the business as well\\nas yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe\\nthere is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one\\nwho more deserves a good husband\\n\\njohn dashwood was greatly astonished but his nature\\nwas calm not open to provocation and he never wished\\nto offend anybody especially anybody of good fortune\\nhe therefore replied without any resentment\\n\\ni would by no means speak disrespectfully of any\\nrelation of yours madam  miss lucy steele is i dare say\\na very deserving young woman but in the present case\\nyou know the connection must be impossible\\nand to have entered into a secret engagement with a\\nyoung man under her uncles care the son of a woman\\nespecially of such very large fortune as mrs ferrars\\nis perhaps altogether a little extraordinary in short\\ni do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person\\nwhom you have a regard for mrs jennings  we all wish\\nher extremely happy and mrs ferrarss conduct throughout\\nthe whole has been such as every conscientious good mother\\nin like circumstances would adopt  it has been dignified\\nand liberal  edward has drawn his own lot and i fear\\nit will be a bad one\\n\\nmarianne sighed out her similar apprehension\\nand elinors heart wrung for the feelings of edward\\nwhile braving his mothers threats for a woman who could\\nnot reward him\\n\\nwell sir said mrs jennings and how did it end\\n\\ni am sorry to say maam in a most unhappy rupture\\nedward is dismissed for ever from his mothers notice\\nhe left her house yesterday but where he is gone or whether\\nhe is still in town i do not know for we of course can\\nmake no inquiry\\n\\npoor young manand what is to become of him\\n\\nwhat indeed maam  it is a melancholy consideration\\nborn to the prospect of such affluence  i cannot conceive\\na situation more deplorable  the interest of two thousand\\npoundshow can a man live on itand when to that is added\\nthe recollection that he might but for his own folly\\nwithin three months have been in the receipt of two\\nthousand five hundred ayear for miss morton has\\nthirty thousand pounds i cannot picture to myself\\na more wretched condition  we must all feel for him\\nand the more so because it is totally out of our power\\nto assist him\\n\\npoor young man cried mrs jennings i am sure\\nhe should be very welcome to bed and board at my house\\nand so i would tell him if i could see him  it is not fit\\nthat he should be living about at his own charge now\\nat lodgings and taverns\\n\\nelinors heart thanked her for such kindness towards edward\\nthough she could not forbear smiling at the form of it\\n\\nif he would only have done as well by himself\\nsaid john dashwood as all his friends were disposed to do\\nby him he might now have been in his proper situation\\nand would have wanted for nothing  but as it is it must\\nbe out of anybodys power to assist him  and there is one\\nthing more preparing against him which must be worse than\\nallhis mother has determined with a very natural kind\\nof spirit to settle that estate upon robert immediately\\nwhich might have been edwards on proper conditions\\ni left her this morning with her lawyer talking over\\nthe business\\n\\nwell said mrs jennings that is her revenge\\neverybody has a way of their own  but i dont think mine\\nwould be to make one son independent because another had\\nplagued me\\n\\nmarianne got up and walked about the room\\n\\ncan anything be more galling to the spirit of a man\\ncontinued john than to see his younger brother in\\npossession of an estate which might have been his own\\npoor edward  i feel for him sincerely\\n\\na few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion\\nconcluded his visit and with repeated assurances to his\\nsisters that he really believed there was no material\\ndanger in fannys indisposition and that they need\\nnot therefore be very uneasy about it he went away\\nleaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments\\non the present occasion as far at least as it regarded\\nmrs ferrarss conduct the dashwoods and edwards\\n\\nmariannes indignation burst forth as soon as he\\nquitted the room and as her vehemence made reserve\\nimpossible in elinor and unnecessary in mrs jennings\\nthey all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 38\\n\\n\\nmrs jennings was very warm in her praise of edwards\\nconduct but only elinor and marianne understood its\\ntrue merit  they only knew how little he had had to tempt\\nhim to be disobedient and how small was the consolation\\nbeyond the consciousness of doing right that could\\nremain to him in the loss of friends and fortune\\nelinor gloried in his integrity and marianne forgave all\\nhis offences in compassion for his punishment  but though\\nconfidence between them was by this public discovery\\nrestored to its proper state it was not a subject on\\nwhich either of them were fond of dwelling when alone\\nelinor avoided it upon principle as tending to fix still\\nmore upon her thoughts by the too warm too positive\\nassurances of marianne that belief of edwards continued\\naffection for herself which she rather wished to do away\\nand mariannes courage soon failed her in trying\\nto converse upon a topic which always left her more\\ndissatisfied with herself than ever by the comparison\\nit necessarily produced between elinors conduct and her own\\n\\nshe felt all the force of that comparison but not\\nas her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now\\nshe felt it with all the pain of continual selfreproach\\nregretted most bitterly that she had never exerted\\nherself before but it brought only the torture of penitence\\nwithout the hope of amendment  her mind was so much weakened\\nthat she still fancied present exertion impossible\\nand therefore it only dispirited her more\\n\\nnothing new was heard by them for a day or two afterwards\\nof affairs in harley street or bartletts buildings\\nbut though so much of the matter was known to them already\\nthat mrs jennings might have had enough to do in spreading\\nthat knowledge farther without seeking after more\\nshe had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort\\nand inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could\\nand nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual\\nhad prevented her going to them within that time\\n\\nthe third day succeeding their knowledge of the\\nparticulars was so fine so beautiful a sunday as to draw\\nmany to kensington gardens though it was only the second\\nweek in march  mrs jennings and elinor were of the number\\nbut marianne who knew that the willoughbys were again\\nin town and had a constant dread of meeting them\\nchose rather to stay at home than venture into so public\\na place\\n\\nan intimate acquaintance of mrs jennings joined\\nthem soon after they entered the gardens and elinor was\\nnot sorry that by her continuing with them and engaging\\nall mrs jenningss conversation she was herself left\\nto quiet reflection  she saw nothing of the willoughbys\\nnothing of edward and for some time nothing of anybody\\nwho could by any chance whether grave or gay be interesting\\nto her  but at last she found herself with some surprise\\naccosted by miss steele who though looking rather shy\\nexpressed great satisfaction in meeting them and on receiving\\nencouragement from the particular kindness of mrs jennings\\nleft her own party for a short time to join theirs\\nmrs jennings immediately whispered to elinor\\n\\nget it all out of her my dear  she will tell you\\nany thing if you ask  you see i cannot leave mrs clarke\\n\\nit was lucky however for mrs jenningss curiosity\\nand elinors too that she would tell any thing without\\nbeing asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt\\n\\ni am so glad to meet you said miss steele\\ntaking her familiarly by the armfor i wanted to see you\\nof all things in the world  and then lowering her voice\\ni suppose mrs jennings has heard all about it\\nis she angry\\n\\nnot at all i believe with you\\n\\nthat is a good thing  and lady middleton is she angry\\n\\ni cannot suppose it possible that she should\\n\\ni am monstrous glad of it  good gracious  i have\\nhad such a time of it  i never saw lucy in such a rage\\nin my life  she vowed at first she would never trim me\\nup a new bonnet nor do any thing else for me again\\nso long as she lived but now she is quite come to\\nand we are as good friends as ever  look she made me\\nthis bow to my hat and put in the feather last night\\nthere now you are going to laugh at me too  but why\\nshould not i wear pink ribbons  i do not care if it is\\nthe doctors favourite colour  i am sure for my part\\ni should never have known he did like it better than\\nany other colour if he had not happened to say so\\nmy cousins have been so plaguing me  i declare sometimes\\ni do not know which way to look before them\\n\\nshe had wandered away to a subject on which elinor\\nhad nothing to say and therefore soon judged it expedient\\nto find her way back again to the first\\n\\nwell but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly\\npeople may say what they chuse about mr ferrarss\\ndeclaring he would not have lucy for it is no such thing\\ni can tell you and it is quite a shame for such illnatured\\nreports to be spread abroad  whatever lucy might think\\nabout it herself you know it was no business of other\\npeople to set it down for certain\\n\\ni never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before\\ni assure you said elinor\\n\\noh did not you  but it was said i know very well\\nand by more than one for miss godby told miss sparks\\nthat nobody in their senses could expect mr ferrars\\nto give up a woman like miss morton with thirty thousand\\npounds to her fortune for lucy steele that had\\nnothing at all and i had it from miss sparks myself\\nand besides that my cousin richard said himself\\nthat when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars\\nwould be off and when edward did not come near us\\nfor three days i could not tell what to think myself\\nand i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost\\nfor we came away from your brothers wednesday\\nand we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday\\nand saturday and did not know what was become of him\\nonce lucy thought to write to him but then her spirits\\nrose against that  however this morning he came just\\nas we came home from church and then it all came out\\nhow he had been sent for wednesday to harley street\\nand been talked to by his mother and all of them\\nand how he had declared before them all that he loved\\nnobody but lucy and nobody but lucy would he have\\nand how he had been so worried by what passed\\nthat as soon as he had went away from his mothers house\\nhe had got upon his horse and rid into the country\\nsome where or other and how he had stayed about at an inn\\nall thursday and friday on purpose to get the better\\nof it  and after thinking it all over and over again\\nhe said it seemed to him as if now he had no fortune\\nand no nothing at all it would be quite unkind to keep\\nher on to the engagement because it must be for her loss\\nfor he had nothing but two thousand pounds and no hope\\nof any thing else and if he was to go into orders\\nas he had some thoughts he could get nothing but a curacy\\nand how was they to live upon thathe could not bear\\nto think of her doing no better and so he begged\\nif she had the least mind for it to put an end to the\\nmatter directly and leave him shift for himself\\ni heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be\\nand it was entirely for her sake and upon her account\\nthat he said a word about being off and not upon his own\\ni will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being\\ntired of her or of wishing to marry miss morton or any\\nthing like it  but to be sure lucy would not give\\near to such kind of talking so she told him directly\\nwith a great deal about sweet and love you know\\nand all thatoh la one cant repeat such kind of things\\nyou knowshe told him directly she had not the least\\nmind in the world to be off for she could live with him\\nupon a trifle and how little so ever he might have\\nshe should be very glad to have it all you know\\nor something of the kind  so then he was monstrous happy\\nand talked on some time about what they should do\\nand they agreed he should take orders directly\\nand they must wait to be married till he got a living\\nand just then i could not hear any more for my cousin\\ncalled from below to tell me mrs richardson was come in\\nher coach and would take one of us to kensington gardens\\nso i was forced to go into the room and interrupt them\\nto ask lucy if she would like to go but she did not\\ncare to leave edward so i just run up stairs and put\\non a pair of silk stockings and came off with the richardsons\\n\\ni do not understand what you mean by interrupting them\\nsaid elinor you were all in the same room together\\nwere not you\\n\\nno indeed not us  la miss dashwood do you\\nthink people make love when any body else is by  oh\\nfor shameto be sure you must know better than that\\nlaughing affectedlyno no they were shut up in the\\ndrawingroom together and all i heard was only by listening\\nat the door\\n\\nhow cried elinor have you been repeating to me\\nwhat you only learnt yourself by listening at the door\\ni am sorry i did not know it before for i certainly\\nwould not have suffered you to give me particulars of a\\nconversation which you ought not to have known yourself\\nhow could you behave so unfairly by your sister\\n\\noh la there is nothing in that  i only stood at\\nthe door and heard what i could  and i am sure lucy would\\nhave done just the same by me for a year or two back\\nwhen martha sharpe and i had so many secrets together\\nshe never made any bones of hiding in a closet or behind\\na chimneyboard on purpose to hear what we said\\n\\nelinor tried to talk of something else but miss\\nsteele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes\\nfrom what was uppermost in her mind\\n\\nedward talks of going to oxford soon said she\\nbut now he is lodging at no  pall mall  what an\\nillnatured woman his mother is ant she and your\\nbrother and sister were not very kind however\\ni shant say anything against them to you and to be sure\\nthey did send us home in their own chariot which\\nwas more than i looked for  and for my part i was all\\nin a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the\\nhuswifes she had gave us a day or two before but however\\nnothing was said about them and i took care to keep mine\\nout of sight  edward have got some business at oxford\\nhe says so he must go there for a time and after that\\nas soon as he can light upon a bishop he will be ordained\\ni wonder what curacy he will getgood gracious\\ngiggling as she spoke id lay my life i know what\\nmy cousins will say when they hear of it  they will\\ntell me i should write to the doctor to get edward\\nthe curacy of his new living  i know they will but i am\\nsure i would not do such a thing for all the world\\nla i shall say directly i wonder how you could think\\nof such a thing  i write to the doctor indeed\\n\\nwell said elinor it is a comfort to be prepared\\nagainst the worst  you have got your answer ready\\n\\nmiss steele was going to reply on the same subject\\nbut the approach of her own party made another more necessary\\n\\noh la here come the richardsons  i had a vast deal\\nmore to say to you but i must not stay away from them not\\nany longer  i assure you they are very genteel people\\nhe makes a monstrous deal of money and they keep their\\nown coach  i have not time to speak to mrs jennings about\\nit myself but pray tell her i am quite happy to hear she\\nis not in anger against us and lady middleton the same\\nand if anything should happen to take you and your\\nsister away and mrs jennings should want company\\ni am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her\\nfor as long a time as she likes  i suppose lady middleton\\nwont ask us any more this bout  goodby i am sorry\\nmiss marianne was not here  remember me kindly to her\\nla if you have not got your spotted muslin oni wonder\\nyou was not afraid of its being torn\\n\\nsuch was her parting concern for after this she had\\ntime only to pay her farewell compliments to mrs jennings\\nbefore her company was claimed by mrs richardson\\nand elinor was left in possession of knowledge which\\nmight feed her powers of reflection some time though she\\nhad learnt very little more than what had been already\\nforeseen and foreplanned in her own mind  edwards marriage\\nwith lucy was as firmly determined on and the time\\nof its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain\\nas she had concluded it would beevery thing depended\\nexactly after her expectation on his getting that preferment\\nof which at present there seemed not the smallest chance\\n\\nas soon as they returned to the carriage\\nmrs jennings was eager for information but as elinor\\nwished to spread as little as possible intelligence\\nthat had in the first place been so unfairly obtained\\nshe confined herself to the brief repetition of such\\nsimple particulars as she felt assured that lucy\\nfor the sake of her own consequence would choose\\nto have known  the continuance of their engagement\\nand the means that were able to be taken for promoting\\nits end was all her communication and this produced\\nfrom mrs jennings the following natural remark\\n\\nwait for his having a livingay we all know how\\nthat will endthey will wait a twelvemonth and finding\\nno good comes of it will set down upon a curacy of fifty\\npounds ayear with the interest of his two thousand pounds\\nand what little matter mr steele and mr pratt can\\ngive herthen they will have a child every year and\\nlord help em how poor they

dear miss dashwood will excuse the\\n     liberty i take of writing to her but i know your\\n     friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such\\n     a good account of myself and my dear edward after\\n     all the troubles we have went through lately\\n     therefore will make no more apologies but proceed\\n     to say that thank god though we have suffered\\n     dreadfully we are both quite well now and as happy\\n     as we must always be in one anothers love  we have\\n     had great trials and great persecutions but\\n     however at the same time gratefully acknowledge\\n

required urge him to it for prudence sake\\n     and would have parted for ever on the spot would\\n     he consent to it but he said it should never be\\n     he did not regard his mothers anger while he could\\n     have my affections our prospects are not very\\n     bright to be sure but we must wait and hope for\\n     the best he will be ordained shortly and should\\n     it ever be in your power to recommend him to any\\n     body that has a living to bestow am very sure you\\n     will not forget us and dear mrs jennings too\\n     trust she will speak a good word for us to sir

for the air the liberty\\nthe quiet of the country and fancied that if any place\\ncould give her ease barton must do it  elinor was hardly\\nless anxious than herself for their removal and only so much\\nless bent on its being effected immediately as that she\\nwas conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey\\nwhich marianne could not be brought to acknowledge\\nshe began however seriously to turn her thoughts towards\\nits accomplishment and had already mentioned their wishes\\nto their kind hostess who resisted them with all the\\neloquence of her goodwill when a plan was suggested\\nwhich though detaining them from home yet a few weeks\\nlonger appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible\\nthan any other the palmers were to remove to cleveland\\nabout the end of march for the easter holidays\\nand mrs jennings with both her friends received a very\\nwarm invitation from charlotte to go with them  this would\\nnot in itself have been sufficient for the delicacy of\\nmiss dashwoodbut it was inforced with so much real\\npoliteness by mr palmer himself as joined to the very\\ngreat amendment of his manners towards them since her\\nsister had been known to be unhappy induced her to accept\\nit with pleasure\\n\\nwhen she told marianne what she had done however\\nher first reply was not very auspicious\\n\\nclevelandshe cried with great agitation\\nno i cannot go to cleveland\\n\\nyou forget said elinor gently that its situation\\nis notthat it is not in the neighbourhood of\\n\\nbut it is in somersetshirei cannot go\\ninto somersetshirethere where i looked forward\\nto goingno elinor you cannot expect me to go there\\n\\nelinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming\\nsuch feelingsshe only endeavoured to counteract them by\\nworking on othersrepresented it therefore as a measure\\nwhich would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother\\nwhom she so much wished to see in a more eligible\\nmore comfortable manner than any other plan could do\\nand perhaps without any greater delay  from cleveland\\nwhich was within a few miles of bristol the distance to\\nbarton was not beyond one day though a long days journey\\nand their mothers servant might easily come there to attend\\nthem down and as there could be no occasion of their\\nstaying above a week at cleveland they might now be at\\nhome in little more than three weeks time  as mariannes\\naffection for her mother was sincere it must triumph\\nwith little difficulty over the imaginary evils she had started\\n\\nmrs jennings was so far from being weary of her guest\\nthat she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again\\nfrom cleveland  elinor was grateful for the attention\\nbut it could not alter her design and their mothers\\nconcurrence being readily gained every thing relative\\nto their return was arranged as far as it could be\\nand marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement\\nof the hours that were yet to divide her from barton\\n\\nah colonel i do not know what you and i shall\\ndo without the miss dashwoodswas mrs jenningss\\naddress to him when he first called on her after their\\nleaving her was settledfor they are quite resolved\\nupon going home from the palmersand how forlorn we\\nshall be when i come backlord we shall sit and gape\\nat one another as dull as two cats\\n\\nperhaps mrs jennings was in hopes by this vigorous\\nsketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make\\nthat offer which might give himself an escape from it\\nand if so she had soon afterwards good reason to think\\nher object gained for on elinors moving to the window\\nto take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print\\nwhich she was going to copy for her friend he followed\\nher to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed\\nwith her there for several minutes  the effect of his\\ndiscourse on the lady too could not escape her observation\\nfor though she was too honorable to listen and had even\\nchanged her seat on purpose that she might not hear\\nto one close by the piano forte on which marianne\\nwas playing she could not keep herself from seeing\\nthat elinor changed colour attended with agitation\\nand was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment\\nstill farther in confirmation of her hopes in the interval\\nof mariannes turning from one lesson to another\\nsome words of the colonels inevitably reached her ear\\nin which he seemed to be apologising for the badness\\nof his house  this set the matter beyond a doubt\\nshe wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary\\nto do so but supposed it to be the proper etiquette\\nwhat elinor said in reply she could not distinguish\\nbut judged from the motion of her lips that she did\\nnot think that any material objectionand mrs jennings\\ncommended her in her heart for being so honest\\nthey then talked on for a few minutes longer without her\\ncatching a syllable when another lucky stop in mariannes\\nperformance brought her these words in the colonels calm voice\\n\\ni am afraid it cannot take place very soon\\n\\nastonished and shocked at so unloverlike a speech\\nshe was almost ready to cry out lord what should\\nhinder itbut checking her desire confined herself\\nto this silent ejaculation\\n\\nthis is very strangesure he need not wait to be older\\n\\nthis delay on the colonels side however did not\\nseem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least\\nfor on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards\\nand moving different ways mrs jennings very plainly heard\\nelinor say and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said\\n\\ni shall always think myself very much obliged to you\\n\\nmrs jennings was delighted with her gratitude\\nand only wondered that after hearing such a sentence\\nthe colonel should be able to take leave of them as he\\nimmediately did with the utmost sangfroid and go away\\nwithout making her any replyshe had not thought her old\\nfriend could have made so indifferent a suitor\\n\\nwhat had really passed between them was to this effect\\n\\ni have heard said he with great compassion\\nof the injustice your friend mr ferrars has suffered\\nfrom his family for if i understand the matter right\\nhe has been entirely cast off by them for persevering\\nin his engagement with a very deserving young woman\\nhave i been rightly informedis it so\\n\\nelinor told him that it was\\n\\nthe cruelty the impolitic crueltyhe replied\\nwith great feelingof dividing or attempting to divide\\ntwo young people long attached to each other is terrible\\nmrs ferrars does not know what she may be doingwhat\\nshe may drive her son to  i have seen mr ferrars two\\nor three times in harley street and am much pleased\\nwith him  he is not a young man with whom one can\\nbe intimately acquainted in a short time but i have\\nseen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake\\nand as a friend of yours i wish it still more\\ni understand that he intends to take orders  will you\\nbe so good as to tell him that the living of delaford\\nnow just vacant as i am informed by this days post\\nis his if he think it worth his acceptancebut that\\nperhaps so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now\\nit may be  nonsense to appear to doubt i only wish it\\nwere more  valuable it is a rectory but a small one\\nthe late incumbent i believe did not make more than\\n200 l per annum and though it is certainly capable\\nof improvement i fear not to such an amount as\\nto afford him a very comfortable income  such as it is\\nhowever my pleasure in presenting him to it\\nwill be very great  pray assure him of it\\n\\nelinors astonishment at this commission could\\nhardly have been greater had the colonel been really\\nmaking her an offer of his hand  the preferment\\nwhich only two days before she had considered as hopeless\\nfor edward was already provided to enable him to marry\\nand she of all people in the world was fixed on to\\nbestow ither emotion was such as mrs jennings had\\nattributed to a very different causebut whatever minor\\nfeelings less pure less pleasing might have a share\\nin that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence\\nand her gratitude for the particular friendship\\nwhich together prompted colonel brandon to this act\\nwere strongly felt and warmly expressed  she thanked him\\nfor it with all her heart spoke of edwards principles and\\ndisposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve\\nand promised to undertake the commission with pleasure\\nif it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office\\nto another  but at the same time she could not help\\nthinking that no one could so well perform it as himself\\nit was an office in short from which unwilling to give\\nedward the pain of receiving an obligation from her\\nshe would have been very glad to be spared herself\\nbut colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy\\ndeclining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being\\ngiven through her means that she would not on any account\\nmake farther opposition  edward she believed was still in\\ntown\\nand fortunately she had heard his address from miss steele\\nshe could undertake therefore to inform him of it\\nin the course of the day  after this had been settled\\ncolonel brandon began to talk of his own advantage\\nin securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour\\nand then it was that he mentioned with regret that the\\nhouse was small and indifferentan evil which elinor\\nas mrs jennings had supposed her to do made very light of\\nat least as far as regarded its size\\n\\nthe smallness of the house said she\\ni cannot imagine any inconvenience to them\\nfor it will be in proportion to their family and income\\n\\nby which the colonel was surprised to find that she\\nwas considering mr ferrarss marriage as the certain\\nconsequence of the presentation for he did not suppose it\\npossible that delaford living could supply such an income\\nas anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on\\nand he said so\\n\\nthis little rectory can do no more than make mr ferrars\\ncomfortable as a bachelor it cannot enable him to marry\\ni am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this\\nand my interest is hardly more extensive  if however\\nby an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve\\nhim farther i must think very differently of him\\nfrom what i now do if i am not as ready to be useful\\nto him then as i sincerely wish i could be at present\\nwhat i am now doing indeed seems nothing at all\\nsince it can advance him so little towards what must\\nbe his principal his only object of happiness\\nhis marriage must still be a distant goodat least\\ni am afraid it cannot take place very soon\\n\\nsuch was the sentence which when misunderstood\\nso justly offended the delicate feelings of mrs jennings\\nbut after this narration of what really passed between\\ncolonel brandon and elinor while they stood at the window\\nthe gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may\\nperhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited\\nnor less properly worded than if it had arisen from\\nan offer of marriage\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 40\\n\\n\\nwell miss dashwood said mrs jennings\\nsagaciously smiling as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn\\ni do not ask you what the colonel has been saying to you\\nfor though upon my honour i tried to keep out of hearing\\ni could not help catching enough to understand his business\\nand i assure you i never was better pleased in my life\\nand i wish you joy of it with all my heart\\n\\nthank you maam said elinor  it is a matter\\nof great joy to me and i feel the goodness of colonel\\nbrandon most sensibly  there are not many men who would\\nact as he has done  few people who have so compassionate\\na heart  i never was more astonished in my life\\n\\nlord my dear you are very modest  i ant the least\\nastonished at it in the world for i have often thought\\nof late there was nothing more likely to happen\\n\\nyou judged from your knowledge of the colonels\\ngeneral benevolence but at least you could not foresee\\nthat the opportunity would so very soon occur\\n\\nopportunity repeated mrs jenningsoh as to that\\nwhen a man has once made up his mind to such a thing\\nsomehow or other he will soon find an opportunity\\nwell my dear i wish you joy of it again and again\\nand if ever there was a happy couple in the world i think\\ni shall soon know where to look for them\\n\\nyou mean to go to delaford after them i suppose\\nsaid elinor with a faint smile\\n\\naye my dear that i do indeed  and as to the house\\nbeing a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at\\nfor it is as good a one as ever i saw\\n\\nhe spoke of its being out of repair\\n\\nwell and whose fault is that why dont he repair it\\nwho should do it but himself\\n\\nthey were interrupted by the servants coming in to\\nannounce the carriage being at the door and mrs jennings\\nimmediately preparing to go said\\n\\nwell my dear i must be gone before i have had half\\nmy talk out  but however we may have it all over in\\nthe evening for we shall be quite alone  i do not ask\\nyou to go with me for i dare say your mind is too full\\nof the matter to care for company and besides you must\\nlong to tell your sister all about it\\n\\nmarianne had left the room before the conversation began\\n\\ncertainly maam i shall tell marianne of it\\nbut i shall not mention it at present to any body else\\n\\noh very well said mrs jennings rather disappointed\\nthen you would not have me tell it to lucy for i think\\nof going as far as holborn today\\n\\nno maam not even lucy if you please\\none days delay will not be very material and till i\\nhave written to mr ferrars i think it ought not to be\\nmentioned to any body else  i shall do that directly\\nit is of importance that no time should be lost with him\\nfor he will of course have much to do relative to\\nhis ordination\\n\\nthis speech at first puzzled mrs jennings exceedingly\\nwhy mr ferrars was to have been written to about it\\nin such a hurry she could not immediately comprehend\\na few moments reflection however produced a very happy idea\\nand she exclaimed\\n\\noh hoi understand you  mr ferrars is to be\\nthe man  well so much the better for him  ay to be sure\\nhe must be ordained in readiness and i am very glad\\nto find things are so forward between you  but my dear\\nis not this rather out of character  should not the colonel\\nwrite himselfsure he is the proper person\\n\\nelinor did not quite understand the beginning of\\nmrs jenningss speech neither did she think it worth\\ninquiring into and therefore only replied to its conclusion\\n\\ncolonel brandon is so delicate a man that he rather\\nwished any one to announce his intentions to mr ferrars\\nthan himself\\n\\nand so you are forced to do it  well that is an odd\\nkind of delicacy  however i will not disturb you seeing\\nher preparing to write  you know your own concerns best\\nso goodby my dear  i have not heard of any thing to\\nplease me so well since charlotte was brought to bed\\n\\nand away she went but returning again in a moment\\n\\ni have just been thinking of bettys sister my dear\\ni should be very glad to get her so good a mistress\\nbut whether she would do for a ladys maid i am sure i\\ncant tell  she is an excellent housemaid and works\\nvery well at her needle  however you will think of all\\nthat at your leisure\\n\\ncertainly maam replied elinor not hearing\\nmuch of what she said and more anxious to be alone\\nthan to be mistress of the subject\\n\\nhow she should beginhow she should express\\nherself in her note to edward was now all her concern\\nthe particular circumstances between them made\\na difficulty of that which to any other person would\\nhave been the easiest thing in the world but she\\nequally feared to say too much or too little and sat\\ndeliberating over her paper with the pen in her band\\ntill broken in on by the entrance of edward himself\\n\\nhe had met mrs jennings at the door in her way to\\nthe carriage as he came to leave his farewell card and she\\nafter apologising for not returning herself had obliged\\nhim to enter by saying that miss dashwood was above\\nand wanted to speak with him on very particular business\\n\\nelinor had just been congratulating herself\\nin the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it\\nmight be to express herself properly by letter it was\\nat least preferable to giving the information by word\\nof mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this\\ngreatest exertion of all  her astonishment and confusion\\nwere very great on his so sudden appearance  she had\\nnot seen him before since his engagement became public\\nand therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted\\nwith it which with the consciousness of what she\\nhad been thinking of and what she had to tell him\\nmade her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes\\nhe too was much distressed and they sat down together\\nin a most promising state of embarrassmentwhether he\\nhad asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming\\ninto the room he could not recollect but determining\\nto be on the safe side he made his apology in form\\nas soon as he could say any thing after taking a chair\\n\\nmrs jennings told me said he that you wished\\nto speak with me at least i understood her soor i\\ncertainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner\\nthough at the same time i should have been extremely\\nsorry to leave london without seeing you and your sister\\nespecially as it will most likely be some timeit\\nis not probable that i should soon have the pleasure\\nof meeting you again  i go to oxford tomorrow\\n\\nyou would not have gone however said elinor\\nrecovering herself and determined to get over what she\\nso much dreaded as soon as possible without receiving\\nour good wishes even if we had not been able to give them\\nin person  mrs jennings was quite right in what she said\\ni have something of consequence to inform you of\\nwhich i was on the point of communicating by paper\\ni am charged with a most agreeable office breathing\\nrather faster than usual as she spoke  colonel brandon\\nwho was here only ten minutes ago has desired me to say\\nthat understanding you mean to take orders he has\\ngreat pleasure in offering you the living of delaford\\nnow just vacant and only wishes it were more valuable\\nallow me to congratulate you on having so respectable\\nand welljudging a friend and to join in his wish that\\nthe livingit is about two hundred ayearwere much\\nmore considerable and such as might better enable you\\ntoas might be more than a temporary accommodation to\\nyourselfsuch in short as might establish all your views\\nof happiness\\n\\nwhat edward felt as he could not say it himself\\nit cannot be expected that any one else should say for him\\nhe looked all the astonishment which such unexpected\\nsuch unthoughtof information could not fail of exciting\\nbut he said only these two words\\n\\ncolonel brandon\\n\\nyes continued elinor gathering more resolution\\nas some of the worst was over colonel brandon means\\nit as a testimony of his concern for what has lately\\npassedfor the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable\\nconduct of your family has placed youa concern\\nwhich i am sure marianne myself and all your friends\\nmust share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem\\nfor your general character and his particular approbation\\nof your behaviour on the present occasion\\n\\ncolonel brandon give me a livingcan it be possible\\n\\nthe unkindness of your own relations has made you\\nastonished to find friendship any where\\n\\nno replied be with sudden consciousness not to\\nfind it in you for i cannot be ignorant that to you\\nto your goodness i owe it alli feel iti would express\\nit if i couldbut as you well know i am no orator\\n\\nyou are very much mistaken  i do assure you\\nthat you owe it entirely at least almost entirely\\nto your own merit and colonel brandons discernment\\nof it  i have had no hand in it  i did not even know\\ntill i understood his design that the living was vacant\\nnor had it ever occurred to me that he might have\\nhad such a living in his gift  as a friend of mine\\nof my family he may perhapsindeed i know he has\\nstill greater pleasure in bestowing it but upon my word\\nyou owe nothing to my solicitation\\n\\ntruth obliged her to acknowledge some small share\\nin the action but she was at the same time so unwilling\\nto appear as the benefactress of edward that she acknowledged\\nit with hesitation which probably contributed to fix\\nthat suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it\\nfor a short time he sat deep in thought after elinor had ceased\\nto speakat last and as if it were rather an effort he said\\n\\ncolonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability\\ni have always heard him spoken of as such and your brother\\ni know esteems him highly  he is undoubtedly a sensible man\\nand in his manners perfectly the gentleman\\n\\nindeed replied elinor i believe that you will find him\\non farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be\\nand as you will be such very near neighbours for i understand\\nthe parsonage is almost close to the mansionhouse\\nit is particularly important that he should be all this\\n\\nedward made no answer but when she had turned\\naway her head gave her a look so serious so earnest\\nso uncheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter wish\\nthe distance between the parsonage and the mansionhouse\\nmuch greater\\n\\ncolonel brandon i think lodges in st james street\\nsaid he soon afterwards rising from his chair\\n\\nelinor told him the number of the house\\n\\ni must hurry away then to give him those thanks\\nwhich you will not allow me to give you to assure him\\nthat he has made me a veryan exceedingly happy man\\n\\nelinor did not offer to detain him and they parted\\nwith a very earnest assurance on her side of her unceasing\\ngood wishes for his happiness in every change of situation\\nthat might befall him on his with rather an attempt to\\nreturn the same good will than the power of expressing it\\n\\nwhen i see him again said elinor to herself\\nas the door shut him out i shall see him the husband\\nof lucy\\n\\nand with this pleasing anticipation she sat down\\nto reconsider the past recall the words and endeavour\\nto comprehend all the feelings of edward and of course\\nto reflect on her own with discontent\\n\\nwhen mrs jennings came home though she returned\\nfrom seeing people whom she had never seen before\\nand of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say\\nher mind was so much more occupied by the important secret\\nin her possession than by anything else that she\\nreverted to it again as soon as elinor appeared\\n\\nwell my dear she cried i sent you up to the\\nyoung man  did not i do rightand i suppose you had\\nno great difficultyyou did not find him very unwilling\\nto accept your proposal\\n\\nno maam that was not very likely\\n\\nwell and how soon will he be readyfor it seems\\nall to depend upon that\\n\\nreally said elinor i know so little of these kind\\nof forms that i can hardly even conjecture as to the time\\nor the preparation necessary but i suppose two or three\\nmonths will complete his ordination\\n\\ntwo or three months cried mrs jennings lord my dear\\nhow calmly you talk of it and can the colonel wait two\\nor three months lord bless mei am sure it would put me\\nquite out of patienceand though one would be very glad\\nto do a kindness by poor mr ferrars i do think it is\\nnot worth while to wait two or three months for him\\nsure somebody else might be found that would do as well\\nsomebody that is in orders already\\n\\nmy dear maam said elinor what can you be thinking of\\nwhy colonel brandons only object is to be of use to mr ferrars\\n\\nlord bless you my dearsure you do not mean to persuade\\nme that the colonel only marries you for the sake of giving\\nten guineas to mr ferrars\\n\\nthe deception could not continue after this\\nand an explanation immediately took place by which both\\ngained considerable amusement for the moment without any\\nmaterial loss of happiness to either for mrs jennings\\nonly exchanged one form of delight for another and still\\nwithout forfeiting her expectation of the first\\n\\naye aye the parsonage is but a small one said she\\nafter the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction\\nwas over and very likely may be out of repair but to hear\\na man apologising as i thought for a house that to my\\nknowledge has five sitting rooms on the groundfloor and i\\nthink the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds\\nand to you too that had been used to live in barton cottage\\nit seems quite ridiculous  but my dear we must\\ntouch up the colonel to do some thing to the parsonage\\nand make it comfortable for them before lucy goes to it\\n\\nbut colonel brandon does not seem to have any idea\\nof the livings being enough to allow them to marry\\n\\nthe colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two\\nthousand ayear himself he thinks that nobody else can marry\\non less  take my word for it that if i am alive i shall\\nbe paying a visit at delaford parsonage before michaelmas\\nand i am sure i shant go if lucy ant there\\n\\nelinor was quite of her opinion as to the probability\\nof their not waiting for any thing more\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 41\\n\\n\\nedward having carried his thanks to colonel brandon\\nproceeded with his happiness to lucy and such was the\\nexcess of it by the time he reached bartletts buildings\\nthat she was able to assure mrs jennings who called\\non her again the next day with her congratulations\\nthat she had never seen him in such spirits before\\nin her life\\n\\nher own happiness and her own spirits were at\\nleast very certain and she joined mrs jennings most\\nheartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably\\ntogether in delaford parsonage before michaelmas\\nso far was she at the same time from any backwardness\\nto give elinor that credit which edward would give her\\nthat she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most\\ngrateful warmth was ready to own all their obligation\\nto her and openly declared that no exertion for their\\ngood on miss dashwoods part either present or future\\nwould ever surprise her for she believed her capable of\\ndoing any thing in the world for those she really valued\\nas for colonel brandon she was not only ready to worship\\nhim as a saint but was moreover truly anxious that\\nhe should be treated as one in all worldly concerns\\nanxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost\\nand scarcely resolved to avail herself at delaford\\nas far as she possibly could of his servants his carriage\\nhis cows and his poultry\\n\\nit was now above a week since john dashwood had\\ncalled in berkeley street and as since that time no notice\\nhad been taken by them of his wifes indisposition\\nbeyond one verbal enquiry elinor began to feel it\\nnecessary to pay her a visitthis was an obligation\\nhowever which not only opposed her own inclination\\nbut which had not the assistance of any encouragement\\nfrom her companions  marianne not contented with\\nabsolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent\\nto prevent her sisters going at all and mrs jennings\\nthough her carriage was always at elinors service\\nso very much disliked mrs john dashwood that not even her\\ncuriosity to see how she looked after the late discovery\\nnor her strong desire to affront her by taking edwards part\\ncould overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again\\nthe consequence was that elinor set out by herself\\nto pay a visit for which no one could really have\\nless inclination and to run the risk of a teteatete\\nwith a woman whom neither of the others had so much\\nreason to dislike\\n\\nmrs dashwood was denied but before the carriage could\\nturn from the house her husband accidentally came out\\nhe expressed great pleasure in meeting elinor told her\\nthat he had been just going to call in berkeley street\\nand assuring her that fanny would be very glad to see her\\ninvited her to come in\\n\\nthey walked up stairs in to the drawingroomnobody was there\\n\\nfanny is in her own room i suppose said hei\\nwill go to her presently for i am sure she will not\\nhave the least objection in the world to seeing you\\nvery far from it indeed  now especially there\\ncannot bebut however you and marianne were always\\ngreat favouriteswhy would not marianne come\\n\\nelinor made what excuse she could for her\\n\\ni am not sorry to see you alone he replied\\nfor i have a good deal to say to you  this living\\nof colonel brandonscan it be truehas he really given\\nit to edwardi heard it yesterday by chance and was\\ncoming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it\\n\\nit is perfectly truecolonel brandon has given\\nthe living of delaford to edward\\n\\nreallywell this is very astonishingno\\nrelationshipno connection between themand now\\nthat livings fetch such a pricewhat was the value of this\\n\\nabout two hundred a year\\n\\nvery welland for the next presentation to a living\\nof that valuesupposing the late incumbent to have\\nbeen old and sickly and likely to vacate it soonhe\\nmight have got i dare sayfourteen hundred pounds\\nand how came he not to have settled that matter before this\\npersons deathnow indeed it would be too late to sell it\\nbut a man of colonel brandons sensei wonder he should\\nbe so improvident in a point of such common such natural\\nconcernwell i am convinced that there is a vast deal\\nof inconsistency in almost every human character  i suppose\\nhoweveron recollectionthat the case may probably be this\\nedward is only to hold the living till the person to whom\\nthe colonel has really sold the presentation is old enough\\nto take itaye aye that is the fact depend upon it\\n\\nelinor contradicted it however very positively\\nand by relating that she had herself been employed\\nin conveying the offer from colonel brandon to edward\\nand therefore must understand the terms on which it\\nwas given obliged him to submit to her authority\\n\\nit is truly astonishinghe cried after hearing\\nwhat she saidwhat could be the colonels motive\\n\\na very simple oneto be of use to mr ferrars\\n\\nwell well whatever colonel brandon may be\\nedward is a very lucky manyou will not mention the matter\\nto fanny however for though i have broke it to her\\nand she bears it vastly wellshe will not like to hear\\nit much talked of\\n\\nelinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing\\nthat she thought fanny might have borne with composure\\nan acquisition of wealth to her brother by which neither\\nshe nor her child could be possibly impoverished\\n\\nmrs ferrars added he lowering his voice to the\\ntone becoming so important a subject knows nothing\\nabout it at present and i believe it will be best to\\nkeep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be\\nwhen the marriage takes place i fear she must hear\\nof it all\\n\\nbut why should such precaution be usedthough\\nit is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have\\nthe smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has\\nmoney enough to live uponfor that must be quite\\nout of the question yet why upon her late behaviour\\nis she supposed to feel at allshe has done with her\\nson she cast him off for ever and has made all those\\nover whom she had any influence cast him off likewise\\nsurely after doing so she cannot be imagined liable\\nto any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account\\nshe cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him\\nshe would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort\\nof a child and yet retain the anxiety of a parent\\n\\nah elinor said john your reasoning is very good\\nbut it is founded on ignorance of human nature\\nwhen edwards unhappy match takes place depend upon it\\nhis mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him\\nand therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that\\ndreadful event must be concealed from her as much as possible\\nmrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son\\n\\nyou surprise me i should think it must nearly\\nhave escaped her memory by this time\\n\\nyou wrong her exceedingly  mrs ferrars is one\\nof the most affectionate mothers in the world\\n\\nelinor was silent\\n\\nwe think nowsaid mr dashwood after a short pause\\nof roberts marrying miss morton\\n\\nelinor smiling at the grave and decisive importance\\nof her brothers tone calmly replied\\n\\nthe lady i suppose has no choice in the affair\\n\\nchoicehow do you mean\\n\\ni only mean that i suppose from your manner\\nof speaking it must be the same to miss morton whether\\nshe marry edward or robert\\n\\ncertainly there can be no difference for robert\\nwill now to all intents and purposes be considered\\nas the eldest sonand as to any thing else they are\\nboth very agreeable young men i do not know that one\\nis superior to the other\\n\\nelinor said no more and john was also for a short\\ntime silenthis reflections ended thus\\n\\nof one thing my dear sister kindly taking her hand\\nand speaking in an awful whisperi may assure you\\nand i will do it because i know it must gratify you\\ni have good reason to thinkindeed i have it from the\\nbest authority or i should not repeat it for otherwise\\nit would be very wrong to say any thing about itbut\\ni have it from the very best authoritynot that i ever\\nprecisely heard mrs ferrars say it herselfbut her\\ndaughter did and i have it from herthat in short\\nwhatever objections there might be against a certaina\\ncertain connectionyou understand meit would have been\\nfar preferable to her it would not have given her half\\nthe vexation that this does  i was exceedingly pleased\\nto hear that mrs ferrars considered it in that light\\na very gratifying circumstance you know to us all\\nit would have been beyond comparison she said the

in quest of her and elinor was left\\nto improve her acquaintance with robert who by the\\ngay unconcern the happy selfcomplacency of his manner\\nwhile enjoying so unfair a division of his mothers love\\nand liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother\\nearned only by his own dissipated course of life and that\\nbrothers integrity was confirming her most unfavourable\\nopinion of his head and heart\\n\\nthey had scarcely been two minutes by themselves\\nbefore he began to speak of edward for he too had heard\\nof the living and was very inquisitive on the subject\\nelinor repeated the particulars of it as she had given them\\nto john and their effect on robert though very different\\nwas not less striking than it had been on him  he laughed\\nmost immoderately  the idea of edwards being a clergyman\\nand living in a small parsonagehouse diverted him\\nbeyond measureand when to that was added the fanciful\\nimagery of edward reading prayers in a white surplice\\nand publishing the banns of marriage between john smith and\\nmary brown he could conceive nothing more ridiculous\\n\\nelinor while she waited in silence and immovable\\ngravity the conclusion of such folly could not restrain\\nher eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke\\nall the contempt it excited  it was a look however\\nvery well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings and gave\\nno intelligence to him  he was recalled from wit to wisdom\\nnot by any reproof of hers but by his own sensibility\\n\\nwe may treat it as a joke said he at last\\nrecovering from the affected laugh which had considerably\\nlengthened out the genuine gaiety of the momentbut upon\\nmy soul it is a most serious business  poor edward\\nhe is ruined for ever  i am extremely sorry for it\\nfor i know him to be a very goodhearted creature as\\nwellmeaning a fellow perhaps as any in the world\\nyou must not judge of him miss dashwood from your\\nslight acquaintancepoor edwardhis manners are certainly\\nnot the happiest in naturebut we are not all born\\nyou know with the same powersthe same address\\npoor fellowto see him in a circle of strangers\\nto be sure it was pitiable enoughbut upon my soul\\ni believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom\\nand i declare and protest to you i never was so shocked in my\\nlife as when it all burst forth  i could not believe it\\nmy mother was the first person who told me of it\\nand i feeling myself called on to act with resolution\\nimmediately said to her my dear madam i do not know\\nwhat you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself\\ni must say that if edward does marry this young woman\\ni never will see him again that was what i said immediately\\ni was most uncommonly shocked indeedpoor edwardhe has\\ndone for himself completelyshut himself out for ever from\\nall decent societybut as i directly said to my mother\\ni am not in the least surprised at it from his style\\nof education it was always to be expected  my poor mother\\nwas half frantic\\n\\nhave you ever seen the lady\\n\\nyes once while she was staying in this house\\ni happened to drop in for ten minutes and i saw\\nquite enough of her  the merest awkward country girl\\nwithout style or elegance and almost without beauty\\ni remember her perfectly  just the kind of girl i\\nshould suppose likely to captivate poor edward\\ni offered immediately as soon as my mother related\\nthe affair to me to talk to him myself and dissuade\\nhim from the match but it was too late then i found\\nto do any thing for unluckily i was not in the way\\nat first and knew nothing of it till after the breach\\nhad taken place when it was not for me you know\\nto interfere  but had i been informed of it a few\\nhours earlieri think it is most probablethat something\\nmight have been hit on  i certainly should have represented\\nit to edward in a very strong light  my dear fellow\\ni should have said consider what you are doing\\nyou are making a most disgraceful connection and such a one\\nas your family are unanimous in disapproving i cannot\\nhelp thinking in short that means might have been found\\nbut now it is all too late  he must be starved you know\\nthat is certain absolutely starved\\n\\nhe had just settled this point with great composure\\nwhen the entrance of mrs john dashwood put an end to the\\nsubject\\nbut though she never spoke of it out of her own family\\nelinor could see its influence on her mind in the something\\nlike confusion of countenance with which she entered\\nand an attempt at cordiality in her

days would restore\\nher sister to health yet by pronouncing her disorder\\nto have a putrid tendency and allowing the word infection\\nto pass his lips gave instant alarm to mrs palmer\\non her babys account  mrs jennings who had been inclined\\nfrom the first to think mariannes complaint more serious\\nthan elinor now looked very grave on mr harriss report\\nand confirming charlottes fears and caution urged the\\nnecessity of her immediate removal with her infant\\nand mr palmer though treating their apprehensions as idle\\nfound the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great\\nto be withstood  her departure therefore was fixed on\\nand within an hour after mr harriss arrival she set off\\nwith her little boy and his nurse for the house of a\\nnear relation of mr palmers who lived a few miles\\non the other side of bath whither her husband promised\\nat her earnest entreaty to join her in a day or two\\nand whither she was almost equally urgent with her\\nmother to accompany her  mrs jennings however with a\\nkindness of heart which made elinor really love her\\ndeclared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland\\nas long as marianne remained ill and of endeavouring\\nby her own attentive care to supply to her the place\\nof the mother she had taken her from and elinor found her\\non every occasion a most willing and active helpmate\\ndesirous to

no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered\\nand the idea of what tomorrow would have produced\\nbut for this unlucky illness made every ailment severe\\nfor on that day they were to have begun their journey home\\nand attended the whole way by a servant of mrs jennings\\nwere to have taken their mother by surprise on the\\nfollowing forenoon  the little she said was all in\\nlamentation of this inevitable delay though elinor tried\\nto raise her spirits and make her believe as she then\\nreally believed herself that it would be a very short one\\n\\nthe next day produced little or no alteration in the\\nstate of the patient she certainly was not better and\\nexcept that there was no amendment did not appear worse\\ntheir party was now farther reduced for mr

therefore telling him at once\\nthat his stay at cleveland was necessary to herself\\nthat she should want him to play at piquet of an evening\\nwhile miss dashwood was above with her sister c she\\nurged him so strongly to remain that he who was gratifying\\nthe first wish of his own heart by a compliance could not\\nlong even affect to demur especially as mrs jenningss\\nentreaty was warmly seconded by mr palmer who seemed\\nto feel a relief to himself in leaving behind him a person\\nso well able to assist or advise miss dashwood in any emergence\\n\\nmarianne was of course kept in ignorance of all\\nthese arrangements  she knew not that she had been\\nthe means of sending the owners of cleveland away\\nin about seven days from the time of their arrival\\nit gave her no

continued with little variation\\nthe same  mr harris who attended her every day\\nstill talked boldly of a speedy recovery and miss dashwood\\nwas equally sanguine but the expectation of the others\\nwas by no means so cheerful  mrs jennings had determined\\nvery early in the seizure that marianne would never\\nget over it and colonel brandon who was chiefly\\nof use in listening to mrs jenningss forebodings\\nwas not in a state of mind to resist their influence\\nhe tried to reason himself out of fears which the different\\njudgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd\\nbut the many hours of each day in which he was left\\nentirely alone were but too favourable for the admission\\nof every melancholy idea and he could not expel from\\nhis mind the persuasion that he should see marianne no more\\n\\non the morning of the third day however the gloomy\\nanticipations of both were almost done away for when\\nmr harris arrived he declared his patient materially better\\nher pulse was much stronger and every symptom more favourable\\nthan on the preceding visit  elinor confirmed in every\\npleasant hope was all cheerfulness rejoicing that\\nin her letters to her mother she had pursued her own\\njudgment rather than her friends in making very light\\nof the indisposition which delayed them at cleveland\\nand almost fixing on the time when marianne would be\\nable to travel\\n\\nbut the day did not close so auspiciously as it began\\ntowards the evening marianne became ill again growing\\nmore heavy restless and uncomfortable than before\\nher sister however still sanguine was willing to\\nattribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue\\nof having sat up to have her bed made and carefully\\nadministering the cordials prescribed saw her with\\nsatisfaction sink at last into a slumber from which\\nshe expected the most beneficial effects  her sleep\\nthough not so quiet as elinor wished to see it\\nlasted a considerable time and anxious to observe\\nthe result of it herself she resolved to sit with her\\nduring the whole of it  mrs jennings knowing nothing\\nof any change in the patient went unusually early to bed\\nher maid who was one of the principal nurses was recreating\\nherself in the housekeepers room and elinor remained\\nalone with marianne\\n\\nthe repose of the latter became more and more disturbed\\nand her sister who watched with unremitting attention\\nher continual change of posture and heard the frequent\\nbut inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips\\nwas almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber\\nwhen marianne suddenly awakened by some accidental noise\\nin the house started hastily up and with feverish wildness\\ncried out\\n\\nis mama coming\\n\\nnot yet cried the

by london cried marianne\\nin the same hurried manner  i shall never see her\\nif she goes by london\\n\\nelinor perceived with alarm that she was not\\nquite herself and while attempting to soothe her\\neagerly felt her pulse  it was lower and quicker than ever\\nand marianne still talking wildly of mama her alarm\\nincreased so rapidly as to determine her on sending\\ninstantly for mr harris and despatching a messenger\\nto barton for her mother  to consult with colonel brandon\\non the best means of effecting the latter was a thought\\nwhich immediately followed the resolution of its performance\\nand as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place\\nby her sister she hastened down to the drawingroom\\nwhere she knew he was generally to be found at a much\\nlater hour than the

for all\\nher former security and the servant who sat up with her\\nfor she would not allow mrs jennings to be called\\nonly tortured her more by hints of what her mistress\\nhad always thought\\n\\nmariannes ideas were still at intervals\\nfixed incoherently on her mother and whenever she\\nmentioned her name it gave a pang to the heart of\\npoor elinor who reproaching herself for having trifled\\nwith so many days of illness and wretched for some\\nimmediate relief fancied that all relief might soon\\nbe in vain that every thing had been delayed too long\\nand pictured to

advice\\nwhen the formerbut not till after five oclockarrived\\nhis opinion however made some little amends for his delay\\nfor though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant\\nalteration in his patient he would not allow the danger\\nto be material and talked of the relief which a fresh\\nmode of treatment must procure with a confidence which\\nin a lesser degree was communicated to elinor  he promised\\nto call again in the course of three or four hours\\nand left both the patient and her anxious attendant more\\ncomposed than he had found them\\n\\nwith strong concern and with many reproaches for not\\nbeing called to their aid did mrs jennings hear in the\\nmorning of what had passed  her former apprehensions\\nnow with greater reason restored left her no doubt of\\nthe

application\\nof whose success he was as confident as the last and his\\nvisit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached\\nthe ear but could not enter the heart of miss dashwood\\nshe was calm except when she thought of her mother\\nbut she was almost hopeless and in this state she continued\\ntill noon scarcely stirring from her sisters bed\\nher thoughts wandering from one image of

not know said he after a pause of expectation\\non her side and thoughtfulness on his ownhow you\\nmay have accounted for my behaviour to your sister\\nor what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me\\nperhaps you will hardly think the better of meit is\\nworth the trial however and you shall hear every thing\\nwhen i first became intimate in your family i had no\\nother intention no other view in the acquaintance\\nthan to pass my time pleasantly while i was obliged to remain\\nin devonshire more pleasantly than i had ever done before\\nyour sisters lovely person and interesting manners\\ncould not but please me and her behaviour to me almost\\nfrom the first was of a kindit is astonishing\\nwhen i reflect on what it was and what she was that my\\nheart should have been so insensible  but at first\\ni must confess my vanity only was elevated by it\\ncareless of her happiness thinking only of my own amusement\\ngiving way to feelings which i had always been too much\\nin the habit of indulging i endeavoured by every means\\nin my power to make myself pleasing to her without any\\ndesign of returning her affection\\n\\nmiss dashwood at this point turning her eyes on him\\nwith the most angry contempt stopped him by saying\\n\\nit is hardly worth while mr willoughby\\nfor you to relate or for me to listen any longer\\nsuch a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing\\ndo not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on\\nthe subject\\n\\ni insist on you hearing the whole of it he replied\\nmy fortune was never large and i had always been expensive\\nalways in the habit of associating with people of better\\nincome than myself  every year since my coming of age\\nor even before i believe had added to my debts and though\\nthe death of my old cousin mrs smith was to set me free\\nyet that event being uncertain and possibly far distant\\nit had been for some time my intention to reestablish my\\ncircumstances by marrying a woman of fortune  to attach\\nmyself to your sister therefore was not a thing to be\\nthought ofand with a meanness selfishness cruelty\\nwhich no indignant no contemptuous look even of yours\\nmiss dashwood can ever reprobate too muchi was acting\\nin this manner trying to engage her regard without a\\nthought of returning itbut one thing may be said\\nfor me even in that horrid state of selfish vanity\\ni did not know the extent of the injury i meditated\\nbecause i did not then know what it was to love\\nbut have i ever known itwell may it be doubted for had i\\nreally loved could i have sacrificed my feelings to vanity\\nto avariceor what is more could i have sacrificed hers\\nbut i have done it  to avoid a comparative poverty\\nwhich her affection and her society would have deprived\\nof all its horrors i have by raising myself to affluence\\nlost every thing that could make it a blessing\\n\\nyou did then said elinor a little softened\\nbelieve yourself at one time attached to her\\n\\nto have resisted such attractions to have withstood\\nsuch tendernessis there a man on earth who could have\\ndone ityes i found myself by insensible degrees\\nsincerely fond of her and the happiest hours of my life\\nwere what i spent with her when i felt my intentions\\nwere strictly honourable and my feelings blameless\\neven then however when fully determined on paying\\nmy addresses to her i allowed myself most improperly\\nto put off from day to day the moment of doing it\\nfrom an unwillingness to enter into an engagement\\nwhile my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed\\ni will not reason herenor will i stop for you to expatiate\\non the absurdity and the worse than absurdity of scrupling\\nto engage my faith where my honour was already bound\\nthe event has proved that i was a cunning fool\\nproviding with great circumspection for a possible\\nopportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched\\nfor ever  at last however my resolution was taken\\nand i had determined as soon as i could engage her alone\\nto justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her\\nand openly assure her of an affection which i had already\\ntaken such pains to display  but in the interimin the\\ninterim of the very few hours that were to pass before i\\ncould have an opportunity of speaking with her in private\\na circumstance occurredan unlucky circumstance to ruin\\nall my resolution and with it all my comfort  a discovery\\ntook placehere he hesitated and looked downmrs smith\\nhad somehow or other been informed i

whom you received\\nthe account  could it be an impartial one  i acknowledge\\nthat her situation and her character ought to have been\\nrespected by me  i do not mean to justify myself but at\\nthe same time cannot leave you to suppose that i have nothing\\nto urgethat because she was injured she was irreproachable\\nand because i was a libertine she must be a saint\\nif the violence of her passions the weakness of her\\nunderstandingi do not mean however to defend myself\\nher affection for me deserved better treatment and i often\\nwith great selfreproach recall the tenderness which\\nfor a very short time had the power of creating any return\\ni wishi heartily wish it had never been  but i have injured\\nmore than herself and i have injured one whose affection\\nfor memay i say it was scarcely less warm than hers\\nand whose mindoh how infinitely superior\\n\\nyour indifference however towards that unfortunate\\ngirli must say it unpleasant to me as the discussion\\nof such a subject may well beyour indifference is no\\napology for your cruel neglect of her  do not think yourself\\nexcused by any weakness any natural defect of understanding\\non her side in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours\\nyou must have known that while you were enjoying yourself\\nin devonshire pursuing fresh schemes always gay\\nalways happy she was reduced to the extremest indigence\\n\\nbut upon my soul i did not know it he warmly\\nreplied i did not recollect that i had omitted to give\\nher my direction and common sense might have told her\\nhow to find it out\\n\\nwell sir and what said mrs smith\\n\\nshe taxed me with the offence at once and my confusion\\nmay be guessed  the purity of her life the formality\\nof her notions her ignorance of the worldevery thing\\nwas against me  the matter itself i could not deny\\nand vain was every endeavour to soften it  she was\\npreviously disposed i believe to doubt the morality of my\\nconduct in general and was moreover discontented with\\nthe very little attention the very little portion of my\\ntime that i had bestowed on her in my present visit\\nin short it ended in a total breach  by one measure i\\nmight have saved myself  in the height of her morality\\ngood woman she offered to forgive the past if i would\\nmarry eliza  that could not beand i was formally\\ndismissed from her favour and her house  the night\\nfollowing this affairi was to go the next morning\\nwas spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct\\nshould be  the struggle was greatbut it ended too soon\\nmy affection for marianne my thorough conviction of her\\nattachment to meit was all insufficient to outweigh\\nthat dread of poverty or get the better of those false\\nideas of the necessity of riches which i was naturally\\ninclined to feel and expensive society had increased\\ni had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife\\nif i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think\\nthat nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do\\na heavy scene however awaited me before i could leave\\ndevonshirei was engaged to dine with you on that very day\\nsome apology was therefore necessary for my breaking\\nthis engagement  but whether i should write this apology\\nor deliver it in person was a point of long debate\\nto see marianne i felt would be dreadful and i even doubted\\nwhether i could see her again and keep to my resolution\\nin that point however i undervalued my own magnanimity\\nas the event declared for i went i saw her and saw\\nher miserable and left her miserableand left her hoping\\nnever to see her again\\n\\nwhy did you call mr willoughby said elinor\\nreproachfully a note would have answered every purpose\\nwhy was it necessary to call\\n\\nit was necessary to my own pride  i could not bear\\nto leave the country in a manner that might lead you\\nor the rest of the neighbourhood to suspect any part\\nof what had really passed between mrs smith and myself\\nand i resolved therefore on calling at the cottage\\nin my way to honiton  the sight of your dear sister\\nhowever was really dreadful and to heighten the matter\\ni found her alone  you were all gone i do not know where\\ni had left her only the evening before so fully\\nso firmly resolved within my self on doing right\\na few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever\\nand i remember how happy how gay were my spirits as i\\nwalked from the cottage to allenham satisfied with myself\\ndelighted with every body  but in this our last interview\\nof friendship i approached her with a sense of guilt\\nthat almost took from me the power of dissembling\\nher sorrow her disappointment her deep regret when i told\\nher that i was obliged to leave devonshire so

miserable\\nmiss dashwood you cannot have an idea of the comfort it\\ngives me to look back on my own misery  i owe such a grudge\\nto myself for the stupid rascally folly of my own heart\\nthat all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and\\nexultation to me now  well i went left all that i loved\\nand went to those to whom at best i was only indifferent\\nmy journey to towntravelling

separated she was as constant\\nin her own feelings and as full of faith in the constancy\\nof mine as ever awakened all my remorse  i say awakened\\nbecause time and london business and dissipation\\nhad in some measure quieted it and i had been growing\\na fine hardened villain fancying myself indifferent to her\\nand chusing to fancy that she too must have become\\nindifferent to me talking to myself of our past attachment\\nas a mere idle trifling business shrugging up my shoulders\\nin proof of its being so and silencing every reproach\\novercoming every scruple by secretly saying now and then\\ni shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married\\nbut this note made me know myself better  i felt that\\nshe was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman\\nin the world and that i was using her infamously\\nbut every thing was then just settled between miss grey\\nand me  to retreat was impossible  all that i had to do\\nwas to avoid you both  i sent no answer to marianne\\nintending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice\\nand for some time i was even determined not to call in\\nberkeley streetbut at last judging it wiser to affect\\nthe air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else\\ni watched you all safely out of the house one morning\\nand left my name\\n\\nwatched us out of the house\\n\\neven so  you would be surprised to hear how often\\ni watched you how often i was on the point of falling\\nin with you  i have entered many a shop to avoid your sight\\nas the carriage drove by  lodging as i did in bond street\\nthere was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse\\nof one or other of you and nothing but the most constant\\nwatchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing\\ndesire to keep out of your sight could have separated us\\nso long  i avoided the middletons as much as possible\\nas well as everybody else who was likely to prove\\nan acquaintance in common  not aware of their being\\nin town however i blundered on sir john i believe\\nthe first day of his coming and the day after i had called\\nat mrs jenningss  he asked me to a party a dance at his\\nhouse in the eveninghad he not told me as an inducement\\nthat you and your sister were to be there i should have\\nfelt it too certain a thing to trust myself near him\\nthe next morning brought another short note from marianne\\nstill affectionate open artless confidingeverything\\nthat could make my conduct most hateful  i could not\\nanswer it  i triedbut could not frame a sentence\\nbut i thought of her i believe every moment of

of comfort to me to imagine that i knew\\nexactly how she would appear to those who saw her last\\nin this world  she was before me constantly before me\\nas i travelled in the same look and

it happened to catch\\nsophias eye before it caught mineand its size\\nthe elegance of the paper the handwriting altogether\\nimmediately gave her a suspicion  some vague report had\\nreached her before of my attachment to some young lady\\nin devonshire and what had passed within her observation\\nthe preceding evening had marked who the young lady was\\nand made her more jealous than ever  affecting that air\\nof playfulness therefore which is delightful in a woman\\none loves she opened the letter directly and read\\nits contents  she was well paid for her impudence\\nshe read what

indignation against me and concern\\nfor your sister could not resist the temptation of telling\\nme what he knew ought tothough probably he did not\\nthink it wouldvex me horridly  as bluntly as he could\\nspeak it therefore he told me that marianne dashwood\\nwas dying of a putrid fever at clevelanda letter that\\nmorning received from mrs jennings declared her danger\\nmost imminentthe palmers are all gone off in a fright\\nci was too much shocked to be able to pass myself\\noff as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john\\nhis heart was softened in seeing mine suffer and so much\\nof his illwill was done away that when we parted\\nhe almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an\\nold promise about a pointer puppy  what i felt on hearing\\nthat your sister was dyingand dying too believing me\\nthe greatest villain upon earth scorning hating me\\nin her latest momentsfor how could i tell what horrid\\nprojects might not have been imputed  one person i\\nwas sure would represent me as capable of any thing\\nwhat i felt was dreadfulmy resolution was soon made\\nand at eight oclock this morning i was in my carriage\\nnow you know all\\n\\nelinor made no answer

or at least\\nits offspring necessity had required to be sacrificed\\neach faulty propensity in leading him to evil had led\\nhim likewise to punishment  the attachment from which\\nagainst honour against feeling against every better interest\\nhe had outwardly torn himself now when no longer allowable\\ngoverned every thought and the connection for the sake\\nof which he had with little scruple left her sister\\nto misery was likely to prove a source of unhappiness\\nto himself of a far more incurable nature  from a reverie\\nof this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes\\nby willoughby who rousing himself from a reverie at least\\nequally painful started up in preparation for going and said\\n\\nthere is no use in staying here i must be off\\n\\nare you going

a silence even greater than her own\\n\\nas soon as mrs dashwood had recovered herself\\nto see marianne was her first desire and in two minutes she\\nwas with her beloved child rendered dearer to her than ever\\nby absence unhappiness and danger  elinors delight\\nas she saw what each felt in the meeting was only checked\\nby an apprehension of its robbing marianne of farther sleep\\nbut mrs dashwood could be calm could be even prudent\\nwhen the life of a child was at stake and marianne\\nsatisfied in knowing her mother was near her and conscious\\nof being too weak for conversation submitted readily to the\\nsilence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her\\nmrs dashwood would sit up with her all night and elinor\\nin compliance with her mothers entreaty went to bed\\nbut the rest which one night entirely sleepless\\nand many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to\\nmake requisite was kept off by irritation of spirits\\nwilloughby poor willoughby as she now allowed\\nherself to call him was constantly in her thoughts she\\nwould not but have heard his vindication for the world\\nand now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged him\\nso harshly before  but her promise of relating it to her\\nsister was invariably painful  she dreaded the performance\\nof it dreaded what its effect on marianne might be\\ndoubted whether after such an explanation she could ever\\nbe happy with another and for a moment wished willoughby\\na widower  then remembering colonel brandon reproved herself\\nfelt that to his sufferings and his constancy far more\\nthan to his rivals the reward of her sister was due\\nand wished any thing rather than mrs willoughbys death\\n\\nthe shock of colonel brandons errand at barton had been\\nmuch softened to mrs dashwood by her own previous alarm\\nfor so great was her uneasiness about marianne that she\\nhad already determined to set out for cleveland on that\\nvery day without waiting for any further intelligence\\nand had so far settled her journey before his arrival\\nthat the careys were then expected every moment to fetch\\nmargaret away as her mother was unwilling to take her\\nwhere there might be infection\\n\\nmarianne continued to mend every day and the brilliant\\ncheerfulness of mrs dashwoods looks and spirits proved\\nher to be as she repeatedly declared herself one of\\nthe happiest women in the world  elinor could not hear\\nthe declaration nor witness its proofs without sometimes\\nwondering whether her mother ever recollected edward\\nbut mrs dashwood trusting to the temperate account\\nof her own disappointment which elinor had sent her\\nwas led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only\\nof what would increase it  marianne was restored to her\\nfrom a danger in which as she now began to feel\\nher own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate\\nattachment to willoughby had contributed to place her\\nand in her recovery she had yet another source of joy\\nunthought of by elinor  it was thus imparted to her\\nas soon as any opportunity of private conference\\nbetween them occurred\\n\\nat last we are alone  my elinor you do not yet\\nknow all my happiness  colonel brandon loves marianne\\nhe has told me so himself\\n\\nher daughter feeling by turns both pleased and pained\\nsurprised and not surprised was all silent

marrying one of you as the object\\nmost desirable  and i believe marianne will be the most\\nhappy with him of the two\\n\\nelinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so\\nbecause satisfied that none founded on an impartial\\nconsideration of their age characters or feelings\\ncould be givenbut her mother must always be carried\\naway by her imagination on any interesting

may\\nwell believe could talk of nothing but my childhe could\\nnot conceal his distress i saw that it equalled my own\\nand he perhaps thinking that mere friendship as the world\\nnow goes would not justify so warm a sympathyor rather\\nnot thinking at all i supposegiving way to irresistible\\nfeelings made me acquainted with his earnest tender constant\\naffection for marianne  he has loved her my elinor ever since\\nthe first moment of seeing her\\n\\nhere however elinor perceivednot the language\\nnot the professions of colonel brandon but the natural\\nembellishments of her mothers active fancy which fashioned\\nevery thing delightful to her as it chose\\n\\nhis regard for her infinitely surpassing anything\\nthat willoughby ever felt or feigned as much more warm\\nas more sincere or constantwhich ever we are to call it\\nhas subsisted through all the knowledge of dear mariannes\\nunhappy prepossession for that worthless young manand\\nwithout selfishnesswithout encouraging a

established\\n\\ni know it isreplied her mother seriously or\\nafter such a warning i should be the last to encourage\\nsuch affection or even to be pleased by it  but his coming\\nfor me as he did with such active such ready friendship\\nis enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men\\n\\nhis character however answered elinor does not rest\\non one act of kindness to which his affection for marianne\\nwere humanity out of the case would have prompted him\\nto mrs jennings to the middletons he has been long\\nand intimately known they equally love and respect him\\nand even my own

on such a man as willoughby\\nhis own merits must soon secure it\\n\\nto judge from the colonels spirits however\\nyou have not yet made him equally sanguine\\n\\nnohe thinks mariannes affection too deeply\\nrooted for any change in it under a great length of time\\nand even supposing her heart again free is too diffident\\nof himself to believe that with such a difference of age\\nand disposition he could ever attach her  there however\\nhe is quite mistaken  his age is only so much beyond\\nhers as to be an advantage as to make his character and\\nprinciples fixedand his disposition i am well convinced\\nis exactly the very one to make your sister happy\\nand his person his manners too are all in his favour\\nmy partiality does not blind me he certainly is not\\nso handsome as willoughbybut at the same time\\nthere is something much more pleasing in his countenance\\nthere was always a somethingif you rememberin willoughbys\\neyes at times which i did not like\\n\\nelinor could not remember itbut her mother\\nwithout waiting for her assent continued\\n\\nand his manners the colonels manners are not only\\nmore pleasing to me than willoughbys ever were but they\\nare of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching\\nto marianne  their gentleness their genuine attention\\nto other people and their manly unstudied simplicity\\nis much more accordant with her real disposition than\\nthe livelinessoften artificial and often illtimed\\nof the other  i am very sure myself that had willoughby\\nturned out as really amiable as he has proved himself\\nthe contrary marianne would yet never have been so happy\\nwith him as she will be with colonel brandon\\n\\nshe pausedher daughter could not quite agree\\nwith her but her dissent was not

request for she was impatient to pour forth\\nher thanks to him for fetching her mother colonel brandon\\nwas invited to visit her\\n\\nhis emotion on entering the room in seeing her altered\\nlooks and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately\\nheld out to him was such as in elinors conjecture\\nmust arise from something more than his affection for marianne\\nor the consciousness of its being known to others\\nand she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying\\ncomplexion as he looked at her sister the probable\\nrecurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind\\nbrought

arrived\\nand marianne after taking so particular and lengthened\\na leave of mrs jennings one so earnestly grateful so full\\nof respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart\\nfrom a secret acknowledgment of past inattention and bidding\\ncolonel brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend\\nwas carefully assisted by him into the carriage of which he\\nseemed anxious that she should engross at least half\\nmrs dashwood and elinor then followed and the others\\nwere left by themselves to talk of the travellers\\nand feel their own dullness till mrs jennings was summoned\\nto her

days on the road and marianne\\nbore her journey on both without essential fatigue\\nevery thing that the most zealous affection the most\\nsolicitous care could do to render her comfortable\\nwas the office of each watchful companion and each\\nfound their reward in her bodily ease and her calmness\\nof spirits  to elinor the observation of the latter\\nwas particularly grateful  she who had seen her week\\nafter week so constantly suffering oppressed by anguish\\nof heart which she had neither courage to speak of\\nnor fortitude to conceal now saw with a joy which no other\\ncould equally share an apparent composure of mind which\\nin being the result as she trusted of serious reflection\\nmust eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness\\n\\nas they approached barton indeed

earnestly gazing through the window  but here\\nelinor could neither wonder nor blame and when she saw\\nas she assisted marianne from the carriage that she\\nhad been crying she saw only an emotion too natural\\nin itself to raise any thing less tender than pity\\nand in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise  in the\\nwhole of her subsequent manner she traced the direction\\nof a mind awakened to reasonable exertion for no sooner\\nhad they entered their common sittingroom than marianne\\nturned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness\\nas if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight\\nof every object with which the remembrance of willoughby could\\nbe connectedshe said little but every sentence aimed\\nat cheerfulness and though a sigh sometimes escaped her\\nit never passed away without the atonement of a smile\\nafter dinner she would try her pianoforte she went to it\\nbut the music on which her eye first rested was an opera\\nprocured for her by willoughby containing some of their\\nfavourite duets and bearing on its outward leaf her own name\\nin his handwritingthat would not doshe shook her head\\nput the music aside and after running over the keys\\nfor a minute complained of feebleness in her fingers\\nand closed the instrument again declaring however with firmness\\nas she did so that she should in future practice much\\n\\nthe next morning produced no abatement in these\\nhappy symptoms  on the contrary with a mind and body\\nalike strengthened by rest she looked and spoke with\\nmore genuine spirit anticipating the pleasure of\\nmargarets return and talking of the dear family party\\nwhich would then be restored of their mutual pursuits\\nand cheerful society as the only happiness worth a wish\\n\\nwhen the weather is settled and i have recovered\\nmy strength said she we will take long walks together\\nevery day  we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down\\nand see how the children go on we will walk to sir

been leading her to the extreme of languid\\nindolence and selfish repining now at work in introducing\\nexcess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous\\nselfcontrol her smile however changed to a sigh when she\\nremembered that promise to willoughby was yet unfulfilled\\nand feared she had that to communicate which might again\\nunsettle the mind of marianne and ruin at least for a time\\nthis fair prospect of busy tranquillity  willing therefore\\nto delay the evil hour she resolved to wait till her\\nsisters health were more secure before she appointed it\\nbut the resolution was made only to be broken\\n\\nmarianne had been two or three days at home before\\nthe weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself\\nto venture out  but at last a soft genial

before the house\\n\\nthe sisters set out at a pace slow as the feebleness\\nof marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her\\nillness requiredand they had advanced only so far\\nbeyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill\\nthe important hill behind when pausing with her eyes\\nturned towards it marianne calmly said\\n\\nthere exactly therepointing with one hand\\non that

in which\\nyou would have been poorly supported by an affection\\non his side much less certain  had you married\\nyou must have been always poor  his expensiveness is\\nacknowledged even by himself and his whole conduct declares\\nthat selfdenial is a word hardly understood by him\\nhis demands and your inexperience together on a small\\nvery small income must have brought on distresses which\\nwould not be the less grievous to you from having been\\nentirely unknown and unthought of before  your sense\\nof honour and honesty would have led you i know\\nwhen aware of your situation

which had involved him\\nin such difficulties\\n\\nmariannes lips quivered and she repeated the word\\nselfish in a tone that implieddo you really think\\nhim selfish\\n\\nthe whole of his behaviour replied elinor\\nfrom the beginning to the end of the affair has been\\ngrounded on selfishness  it was selfishness which first\\nmade him sport with your affections which afterwards\\nwhen his own were engaged made him delay the confession\\nof it and which finally carried him from barton\\nhis own enjoyment or his own ease was in every particular\\nhis ruling principle\\n\\nit is very true  my happiness never was his object\\n\\nat present continued elinor he regrets what he\\nhas done  and why does he regret itbecause he finds\\nit has not answered towards himself  it has not made\\nhim happy  his circumstances are now unembarrassedhe\\nsuffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only\\nthat he has married a woman of a less amiable temper\\nthan yourself  but does it follow that had he married you\\nhe would have been happythe inconveniences would have\\nbeen different  he would then have suffered under the\\npecuniary distresses which because they are removed\\nhe now reckons as nothing  he would have had a wife\\nof whose temper he could make no complaint but he would\\nhave been always necessitousalways poor and probably\\nwould soon have learned to rank the

was\\ntaken ill had sense enough to call one of the maids\\nwho with mrs dashwoods assistance supported her into\\nthe other room  by that time marianne was rather better\\nand her mother leaving her to the care of margaret\\nand the maid returned to elinor who though still\\nmuch disordered had so far recovered the use of her reason\\nand voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of thomas\\nas to the source of his intelligence  mrs dashwood\\nimmediately took all that trouble on herself and elinor\\nhad the benefit of the information without the exertion\\nof seeking it\\n\\nwho told you that mr ferrars was married thomas\\n\\ni see mr ferrars myself maam this morning\\nin exeter and his lady too miss steele as was  they was\\nstopping in a chaise at the door of the new london inn\\nas i went there with a message from sally at the park\\nto her brother who is one of the postboys i happened\\nto look up as i went by the chaise and so i see directly\\nit was the youngest miss steele so i took off my hat\\nand she knew me and called to me and inquired after you\\nmaam and the young ladies especially miss marianne\\nand bid me i should give her compliments and mr ferrarss\\ntheir best compliments and service and how sorry they\\nwas they had not time to come on and see you but they was\\nin a great hurry to go forwards for they was going further\\ndown for a little while but howsever when they come back\\ntheyd make sure to come and see you\\n\\nbut did she tell you she was married thomas\\n\\nyes maam she smiled and said how she\\nhad changed her name since she was in these parts\\nshe was always a very affable and freespoken young lady\\nand very civil behaved  so i made free to wish her joy\\n\\nwas mr ferrars in the carriage with her\\n\\nyes maam i just see him leaning back in it\\nbut he did not look uphe never was a gentleman much\\nfor talking\\n\\nelinors heart could easily account for his not\\nputting himself forward and mrs dashwood probably\\nfound the same explanation\\n\\nwas there no one else in the carriage\\n\\nno maam only they two\\n\\ndo you know where they came from\\n\\nthey come straight from town as miss lucy\\nmrs ferrars told me\\n\\nand are they going farther westward\\n\\nyes maambut not to bide long  they will soon\\nbe back again and then theyd be sure and call here\\n\\nmrs dashwood now looked at her daughter\\nbut elinor knew better than to expect them\\nshe recognised the whole of lucy in the message and was\\nvery confident that edward would never come near them\\nshe observed in a low voice to her mother that they\\nwere probably going down to mr pratts near plymouth\\n\\nthomass intelligence seemed over  elinor looked\\nas if she wished to hear more\\n\\ndid you see them off before you came away\\n\\nno maamthe horses were just coming out but i\\ncould not bide any longer i was afraid of being late\\n\\ndid mrs ferrars look well\\n\\nyes maam she said how she was very well\\nand to my mind she was always a very handsome young\\nladyand she seemed vastly contented\\n\\nmrs dashwood could think of no other question\\nand thomas and the tablecloth now alike needless\\nwere soon afterwards dismissed  marianne had already sent\\nto say that she should eat nothing more  mrs dashwoods\\nand elinors appetites were equally lost and margaret\\nmight think herself very well off that with so much\\nuneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced\\nso much reason as they had often had to be careless\\nof their meals she had never been obliged to go without\\nher dinner before\\n\\nwhen the dessert and the wine were arranged\\nand mrs dashwood and elinor were left by themselves\\nthey remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness\\nand silence  mrs dashwood feared to hazard any remark\\nand ventured not to offer consolation  she now found\\nthat she had erred in relying on elinors representation\\nof herself and justly concluded that every thing\\nhad been expressly softened at the time to spare her\\nfrom an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then\\nhad suffered for marianne  she found that she had been\\nmisled by the careful the considerate attention of\\nher daughter to think the attachment which once she\\nhad so well understood much slighter in reality than\\nshe had been wont to believe or than it was now proved\\nto be  she feared that under this persuasion she had\\nbeen unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to her elinor\\nthat mariannes affliction because more acknowledged\\nmore immediately before her had too much engrossed\\nher tenderness and led her away to forget that in elinor\\nshe might have a daughter suffering almost as much\\ncertainly with less selfprovocation and greater fortitude\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 48\\n\\n\\nelinor now found the difference between the expectation\\nof an unpleasant event however certain the mind may be told\\nto consider it and certainty itself  she now found that\\nin spite of herself she had always admitted a hope\\nwhile edward remained single that something would occur\\nto prevent his marrying lucy that some resolution of\\nhis own some mediation of friends or some more eligible\\nopportunity of establishment for the lady would arise\\nto assist the happiness of all  but he was now married\\nand she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery\\nwhich so much heightened the pain of the intelligence\\n\\nthat he should be married soon before as she imagined\\nhe could be in orders and consequently before he could\\nbe in possession of the living surprised her a little\\nat first  but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy\\nin her selfprovident care in her haste to secure him\\nshould overlook every thing but the risk of delay\\nthey were married married in town and now hastening\\ndown to her uncles  what had edward felt on being within\\nfour miles from barton on seeing her mothers servant\\non hearing lucys message\\n\\nthey would soon she supposed be settled at\\ndelaforddelafordthat place in which so much\\nconspired to give her an interest which she wished\\nto be acquainted with and yet desired to avoid\\nshe saw them in an instant in their parsonagehouse saw\\nin lucy the active contriving manager uniting at once\\na desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality\\nand ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices\\npursuing her own interest in every thought courting the\\nfavour of colonel brandon of mrs jennings and of every\\nwealthy friend  in edwardshe knew not what she saw\\nnor what she wished to seehappy or unhappynothing\\npleased her she turned away her head from every sketch of him\\n\\nelinor flattered herself that some one of their\\nconnections in london would write to them to announce\\nthe event and give farther particularsbut day after\\nday passed off and brought no letter no tidings\\nthough uncertain that any one were to blame she found\\nfault with every absent friend  they were all thoughtless\\nor indolent\\n\\nwhen do you write to colonel brandon maam\\nwas an inquiry which sprung from the impatience\\nof her mind to have something going on\\n\\ni wrote to him my love last week and rather\\nexpect to see than to hear from him again  i earnestly\\npressed his coming to us and should not be surprised\\nto see him walk in today or tomorrow or any day\\n\\nthis was gaining something something to look forward to\\ncolonel brandon must have some information to give\\n\\nscarcely had she so determined it when the figure\\nof a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window\\nhe stopt at their gate  it was a gentleman it\\nwas colonel brandon himself  now she could hear more\\nand she trembled in expectation of it  butit was\\nnot colonel brandonneither his airnor his height\\nwere it possible she must say it must be edward\\nshe looked again  he had just dismountedshe could not be\\nmistakenit was edward  she moved away and sat down\\nhe comes from mr pratts purposely to see us  i will be\\ncalm i will be mistress of myself\\n\\nin a moment she perceived that the others were likewise\\naware of the mistake  she saw her mother and marianne\\nchange colour saw them look at herself and whisper\\na few sentences to each other  she would have given\\nthe world to be able to speakand to make them understand\\nthat she hoped no coolness no slight would appear\\nin their behaviour to himbut she had no utterance\\nand was obliged to leave all to their own discretion\\n\\nnot a syllable passed aloud  they all waited\\nin silence for the appearance of their visitor\\nhis footsteps were heard along the gravel path in a moment\\nhe was in the passage and in another he was before them\\n\\nhis countenance as he entered the room was not\\ntoo happy even for elinor  his complexion was white\\nwith agitation and he looked as if fearful of his\\nreception and conscious that he merited no kind one\\nmrs dashwood however conforming as she trusted\\nto the wishes of that daughter by whom she then meant\\nin the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing\\nmet with a look of forced complacency gave him her hand\\nand wished him joy\\n\\nhe coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply\\nelinors lips had moved with her mothers and when the\\nmoment of action was over she wished that she had shaken\\nhands with him too  but it was then too late and with a\\ncountenance meaning to be open she sat down again\\nand talked of the weather\\n\\nmarianne had retreated as much as possible\\nout of sight to conceal her distress and margaret\\nunderstanding some part but not the whole of the case\\nthought it incumbent on her to be dignified and therefore\\ntook a seat as far from him as she could and maintained\\na strict silence\\n\\nwhen elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness\\nof the season a very awful pause took place  it was put\\nan end to by mrs dashwood who felt obliged to hope that he\\nhad left mrs ferrars very well  in a hurried manner\\nhe replied in the affirmative\\n\\nanother pause\\n\\nelinor resolving to exert herself though fearing\\nthe sound of her own voice now said\\n\\nis mrs ferrars at longstaple\\n\\nat longstaple he replied with an air of surprise\\nno my mother is in town\\n\\ni meant said elinor taking up some work from\\nthe table to inquire for mrs edward ferrars\\n\\nshe dared not look upbut her mother and marianne both\\nturned their eyes on him  he coloured seemed perplexed\\nlooked doubtingly and after some hesitation said\\n\\nperhaps you meanmy brotheryou mean mrsmrs\\nrobert ferrars\\n\\nmrs robert ferrarswas repeated by marianne and her\\nmother in an accent of the utmost amazementand though\\nelinor could not speak even her eyes were fixed on him\\nwith the same impatient wonder  he rose from his seat\\nand walked to the window apparently from not knowing\\nwhat to do took up a pair of scissors that lay there\\nand while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting\\nthe latter to pieces as he spoke said in a hurried voice\\n\\nperhaps you do not knowyou may not have heard\\nthat my brother is lately married toto the youngestto\\nmiss lucy steele\\n\\nhis words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment\\nby all but elinor who sat with her head leaning over\\nher work in a state of such agitation as made her hardly\\nknow where she was\\n\\nyes said he they were married last week\\nand are now at dawlish\\n\\nelinor could sit it no longer  she almost ran\\nout of the room and as soon as the door was closed\\nburst into tears of joy which at first she thought would\\nnever cease  edward who had till then looked any where\\nrather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps saw\\nor even heard her emotion for immediately afterwards\\nhe fell into a reverie which no remarks no inquiries\\nno affectionate address of mrs dashwood could penetrate\\nand at last without saying a word quitted the room\\nand walked out towards the villageleaving the others\\nin the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change\\nin his situation so wonderful and so suddena perplexity\\nwhich they had no means of lessening but by their\\nown conjectures\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 49\\n\\n\\nunaccountable however as the circumstances of his\\nrelease might appear to the whole family it was certain\\nthat edward was free and to what purpose that freedom would\\nbe employed was easily predetermined by allfor after\\nexperiencing the blessings of one imprudent engagement\\ncontracted without his mothers consent as he had already\\ndone for more than four years nothing less could be expected\\nof him in the failure of that than the immediate contraction\\nof another\\n\\nhis errand at barton in fact was a simple one\\nit was only to ask elinor to marry himand considering\\nthat he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question\\nit might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable\\nin the present case as he really did so much in need of\\nencouragement and fresh air\\n\\nhow soon he had walked himself into the proper\\nresolution however how soon an opportunity of exercising\\nit occurred in what manner he expressed himself\\nand how he was received need not be particularly told\\nthis only need be saidthat when they all sat down to\\ntable at four oclock about three hours after his arrival\\nhe had secured his lady engaged her mothers consent\\nand was not only in the rapturous profession of\\nthe lover but in the reality of reason and truth\\none of the happiest of men  his situation indeed was\\nmore than commonly joyful  he had more than the ordinary\\ntriumph of accepted love to swell his heart and raise\\nhis spirits  he was released without any reproach\\nto himself from an entanglement which had long formed\\nhis misery from a woman whom he had long ceased to love\\nand elevated at once to that security with another\\nwhich he must have thought of almost with despair\\nas soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire\\nhe was brought not from doubt or suspense but from\\nmisery to happinessand the change was openly spoken\\nin such a genuine flowing grateful cheerfulness\\nas his friends had never witnessed in him before\\n\\nhis heart was now open to elinor all its weaknesses\\nall its errors confessed and his first boyish attachment\\nto lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twentyfour\\n\\nit was a foolish idle inclination on my side\\nsaid he the consequence of ignorance of the world\\nand want of employment  had my brother given me\\nsome active profession when i was removed at eighteen\\nfrom the care of mr pratt i thinknay i am sure\\nit would never have happened for though i left longstaple\\nwith what i thought at the time a most unconquerable\\npreference for his niece yet had i then had any pursuit\\nany object to engage my time and keep me at a distance\\nfrom her for a few months i should very soon have\\noutgrown the fancied attachment especially by mixing\\nmore with the world as in such case i must have done\\nbut instead of having any thing to do instead of having any\\nprofession chosen for me or being allowed to chuse any myself\\ni returned home to be completely idle and for the first\\ntwelvemonth afterwards i had not even the nominal employment\\nwhich belonging to the university would have given me\\nfor i was not entered at oxford till i was nineteen\\ni had therefore nothing in the world to do but to fancy\\nmyself in love and as my mother did not make my home\\nin every respect comfortable as i had no friend\\nno companion in my brother and disliked new acquaintance\\nit was not unnatural for me to be very often at longstaple\\nwhere i always felt myself at home and was always sure\\nof a welcome and accordingly i spent the greatest part\\nof my time there from eighteen to nineteen lucy appeared\\neverything that was amiable and obliging  she was pretty\\ntooat least i thought so then and i had seen so little\\nof other women that i could make no comparisons and see\\nno defects  considering everything therefore i hope\\nfoolish as our engagement was foolish as it has since\\nin every way been proved it was not at the time an unnatural\\nor an inexcusable piece of folly\\n\\nthe change which a few hours had wrought in the minds\\nand the happiness of the dashwoods was suchso greatas\\npromised them all the satisfaction of a sleepless night\\nmrs dashwood too happy to be comfortable knew not how\\nto love edward nor praise elinor enough how to be enough\\nthankful for his release without wounding his delicacy\\nnor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained\\nconversation together and yet enjoy as she wished\\nthe sight and society of both\\n\\nmarianne could speak her happiness only by tears\\ncomparisons would occurregrets would ariseand her joy\\nthough sincere as her love for her sister was of a kind to\\ngive her neither spirits nor language\\n\\nbut elinorhow are her feelings to be describedfrom\\nthe moment of learning that lucy was married to another\\nthat edward was free to the moment of his justifying\\nthe hopes which had so instantly followed she was every\\nthing by turns but tranquil  but when the second moment\\nhad passed when she found every doubt every solicitude\\nremoved compared her situation with what so lately it\\nhad beensaw him honourably released from his former\\nengagement saw him instantly profiting by the release\\nto address herself and declare an affection as tender\\nas constant as she had ever supposed it to beshe\\nwas oppressed she was overcome by her own felicity\\nand happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily\\nfamiliarized with any change for the better it required\\nseveral hours to give sedateness to her spirits or any\\ndegree of tranquillity to her heart\\n\\nedward was now fixed at the cottage at least for\\na weekfor whatever other claims might be made on him\\nit was impossible that less than a week should be given\\nup to the enjoyment of elinors company or suffice\\nto say half that was to be said of the past the present\\nand the futurefor though a very few hours spent in\\nthe hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more\\nsubjects than can really be in common between any two\\nrational creatures yet with lovers it is different\\nbetween them no subject is finished no communication\\nis even made till it has been made at least twenty\\ntimes over\\n\\nlucys marriage the unceasing and reasonable wonder\\namong them all formed of course one of the earliest\\ndiscussions of the loversand elinors particular knowledge\\nof each party made it appear to her in every view as one\\nof the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances\\nshe had ever heard  how they could be thrown together\\nand by what attraction robert could be drawn on to marry\\na girl of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak\\nwithout any admirationa girl too already engaged\\nto his brother and on whose account that brother had been\\nthrown off by his familyit was beyond her comprehension\\nto make out  to her own heart it was a delightful affair\\nto her imagination it was even a ridiculous one but\\nto her reason her judgment it was completely a puzzle\\n\\nedward could only attempt an explanation by supposing\\nthat perhaps at first accidentally meeting the vanity\\nof the one had been so worked on by the flattery\\nof the other as to lead by degrees to all the rest\\nelinor remembered what robert had told her in harley street\\nof his opinion of what his own mediation in his brothers\\naffairs might have done if applied to in time\\nshe repeated it to edward\\n\\nthat was exactly like robertwas his immediate\\nobservationand that he presently added might\\nperhaps be in his head when the acquaintance between\\nthem first began  and lucy perhaps at first might\\nthink only of procuring his good offices in my favour\\nother designs might afterward arise\\n\\nhow long it had been carrying on between them\\nhowever he was equally at a loss with herself to make out\\nfor at oxford where he had remained for choice ever since\\nhis quitting london he had had no means of hearing of her\\nbut from herself and her letters to the very last were\\nneither less frequent nor less affectionate than usual\\nnot the smallest suspicion therefore had ever occurred\\nto prepare him for what followedand when at last it\\nburst on him in a letter from lucy herself he had been\\nfor some time he believed half stupified between\\nthe wonder the horror and the joy of such a deliverance\\nhe put the letter into elinors hands\\n\\n     dear sir\\n\\n     being very sure i have long lost your affections\\n     i have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own\\n     on another and have no doubt of being as happy with\\n     him as i once used to think i might be with you\\n     but i scorn to accept a hand while the heart was\\n     anothers  sincerely wish you happy in your choice\\n     and it shall not be my fault if we are not always\\n     good friends as our near relationship now makes\\n     proper  i can safely say i owe you no illwill\\n     and am sure you will be too generous to do us any\\n     ill offices  your brother has gained my affections\\n     entirely and as we could not live without one\\n     another we are just returned from the altar and\\n     are now on our way to dawlish for a few weeks which\\n     place your dear brother has great curiosity to see\\n     but thought i would first trouble you with these\\n     few lines and shall always remain\\n\\n     your sincere wellwisher friend and sister\\n                                        lucy ferrars\\n\\n     i have burnt all your letters and will return\\n     your picture the first opportunity  please to destroy\\n     my scrawlsbut the ring with my hair you are very\\n     welcome to keep\\n\\nelinor read and returned it without any comment\\n\\ni will not ask your opinion of it as a composition\\nsaid edwardfor worlds would not i have had a letter\\nof hers seen by you in former daysin a sister it\\nis bad enough but in a wifehow i have blushed over\\nthe pages of her writingand i believe i may say that\\nsince the first half year of our foolishbusinessthis\\nis the only letter i ever received from her of which\\nthe substance made me any amends for the defect of the style\\n\\nhowever it may have come about said elinor\\nafter a pausethey are certainly married  and your mother\\nhas brought on herself a most appropriate punishment\\nthe independence she settled on robert through resentment\\nagainst you has put it in his power to make his own choice\\nand she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand\\nayear to do the very deed which she disinherited the\\nother for intending to do  she will hardly be less hurt\\ni suppose by roberts marrying lucy than she would have\\nbeen by your marrying her\\n\\nshe will be more hurt by it for robert always\\nwas her favouriteshe will be more hurt by it\\nand on the same principle will forgive him much sooner\\n\\nin what state the affair stood at present between them\\nedward knew not for no communication with any of his family\\nhad yet been attempted by him  he had quitted oxford\\nwithin four and twenty hours after lucys letter arrived\\nand with only one object before him the nearest road\\nto barton had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct\\nwith which that road did not hold the most intimate connection\\nhe could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with\\nmiss dashwood and by his rapidity in seeking that fate\\nit is to be supposed in spite of the jealousy with\\nwhich he had once thought of colonel brandon in spite\\nof the modesty with which he rated his own deserts\\nand the politeness with which he talked of his doubts\\nhe did not upon the whole expect a very cruel reception\\nit was his business however to say that he did and he\\nsaid it very prettily  what he might say on the subject\\na twelvemonth after must be referred to the imagination\\nof husbands and wives\\n\\nthat lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go off\\nwith a flourish of malice against him in her message\\nby thomas was perfectly clear to elinor and edward himself\\nnow thoroughly enlightened on her character had no\\nscruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness\\nof wanton illnature though his eyes had been long opened\\neven before his acquaintance with elinor began to her\\nignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions\\nthey had been equally imputed by him to her want\\nof education and till her last letter reached him\\nhe had always believed her to be a welldisposed\\ngoodhearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself\\nnothing but such a persuasion could have prevented\\nhis putting an end to an engagement which long before\\nthe discovery of it laid him open to his mothers anger\\nhad been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him\\n\\ni thought it my duty said he independent of my feelings\\nto give her the option of continuing the engagement or not\\nwhen i was renounced by my mother and stood to all\\nappearance without a friend in the world to assist me\\nin such a situation as that where there seemed nothing\\nto tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature\\nhow could i suppose when she so earnestly so warmly insisted\\non sharing my fate whatever it might be that any thing\\nbut the most disinterested affection was her inducement\\nand even now i cannot comprehend on what motive she acted\\nor what fancied advantage it could be to her to be\\nfettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard\\nand who had only two thousand pounds in the world\\nshe could not foresee that colonel brandon would give me a\\nliving\\n\\nno but she might suppose that something would occur\\nin your favour that your own family might in time relent\\nand at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement\\nfor she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination\\nnor her actions  the connection was certainly a\\nrespectable one and probably gained her consideration among\\nher friends and if nothing more advantageous occurred\\nit would be better for her to marry you than be single\\n\\nedward was of course immediately convinced that\\nnothing could have been more natural than lucys conduct\\nnor more selfevident than the motive of it\\n\\nelinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold\\nthe imprudence which compliments themselves for having\\nspent so much time with them at norland when he must\\nhave felt his own inconstancy\\n\\nyour behaviour was certainly very wrong said she\\nbecauseto say nothing of my own conviction our relations\\nwere all led away by it to fancy and expect what as you\\nwere then situated could never be\\n\\nhe could only plead an ignorance of his own heart\\nand a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement\\n\\ni was simple enough to think that because my faith\\nwas plighted to another there could be no danger in my being\\nwith you and that the consciousness of my engagement was\\nto keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour  i felt\\nthat i admired you but i told myself it was only friendship\\nand till i began to make comparisons between yourself\\nand lucy i did not know how far i was got  after that\\ni suppose i was wrong in remaining so much in sussex\\nand the arguments with which i reconciled myself to the\\nexpediency of it were no better than thesethe danger\\nis my own i am doing no injury to anybody but myself\\n\\nelinor smiled and shook her head\\n\\nedward heard with pleasure of colonel brandons\\nbeing expected at the cottage as he really wished\\nnot only to be better acquainted with him but to have an\\nopportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented\\nhis giving him the living of delafordwhich at present\\nsaid he after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine\\nwere on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven\\nhim for offering\\n\\nnow he felt astonished himself that he had never yet\\nbeen to the place  but so little interest had be taken\\nin the matter that he owed all his knowledge of the house\\ngarden and glebe extent of the parish condition of\\nthe land and rate of the tithes to elinor herself\\nwho had heard so much of it from colonel brandon\\nand heard it with so much attention as to be entirely\\nmistress of the subject\\n\\none question after this only remained undecided\\nbetween them one difficulty only was to be overcome\\nthey were brought together by mutual affection\\nwith the warmest approbation of their real friends\\ntheir intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make\\ntheir happiness certainand they only wanted something\\nto live upon  edward had two thousand pounds and elinor\\none which with delaford living was all that they could\\ncall their own for it was impossible that mrs dashwood\\nshould advance anything and they were neither of them\\nquite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty\\npounds ayear would supply them with the comforts of life\\n\\nedward was not entirely without hopes of some\\nfavourable change in his mother towards him and on that\\nhe rested for the residue of their income  but elinor\\nhad no such dependence for since edward would still\\nbe unable to marry miss morton and his chusing herself\\nhad been spoken of in mrs ferrarss flattering language\\nas only a lesser evil than his chusing lucy steele\\nshe feared that roberts offence would serve no other\\npurpose than to enrich fanny\\n\\nabout four days after edwards arrival colonel\\nbrandon appeared to complete mrs dashwoods satisfaction\\nand to give her the dignity of having for the first time\\nsince her living at barton more company with her than\\nher house would hold  edward was allowed to retain the\\nprivilege of first comer and colonel brandon therefore\\nwalked every night to his old quarters at the park\\nfrom whence he usually returned in the morning early enough\\nto interrupt the lovers first teteatete before breakfast\\n\\na three weeks residence at delaford where\\nin his evening hours at least he had little to do\\nbut to calculate the disproportion between thirtysix\\nand seventeen brought him to barton in a temper of mind\\nwhich needed all the improvement in mariannes looks\\nall the kindness of her welcome and all the encouragement\\nof her mothers language to make it cheerful\\namong such friends however and such flattery he did revive\\nno rumour of lucys marriage had yet reached himhe knew\\nnothing of what had passed and the first hours of his\\nvisit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering\\nevery thing was explained to him by mrs dashwood\\nand he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done\\nfor mr ferrars since eventually it promoted the interest\\nof elinor\\n\\nit would be needless to say that the gentlemen advanced\\nin the good opinion of each other as they advanced in each\\nothers acquaintance for it could not be otherwise\\ntheir resemblance in good principles and good sense\\nin disposition and manner of thinking would probably\\nhave been sufficient to unite them in friendship\\nwithout any other attraction but their being in love\\nwith two sisters and two sisters fond of each other\\nmade that mutual regard inevitable and immediate\\nwhich might otherwise have waited the effect of time\\nand judgment\\n\\nthe letters from town which a few days before would\\nhave made every nerve in elinors body thrill with transport\\nnow arrived to be read with less emotion that mirth\\nmrs jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale to vent her\\nhonest indignation against the jilting girl and pour forth\\nher compassion towards poor mr edward who she was sure\\nhad quite doted upon the worthless hussy and was now\\nby all accounts almost brokenhearted at oxford\\ni do think she continued nothing was ever carried\\non so sly for it was but two days before lucy called\\nand sat a couple of hours with me  not a soul suspected\\nanything of the matter not even nancy who poor soul\\ncame crying to me the day after in a great fright\\nfor fear of mrs ferrars as well as not knowing how to\\nget to plymouth for lucy it seems borrowed all her\\nmoney before she went off to be married on purpose\\nwe suppose to make a show with and poor nancy had not\\nseven shillings in the worldso i was very glad to give\\nher five guineas to take her down to exeter where she\\nthinks of staying three or four weeks with mrs burgess\\nin hopes as i tell her to fall in with the doctor again\\nand i must say that lucys crossness not to take them\\nalong with them in the chaise is worse than all\\npoor mr edward i cannot get him out of my head but you\\nmust send for him to barton and miss marianne must try to\\ncomfort him\\n\\nmr dashwoods strains were more solemn\\nmrs ferrars was the most unfortunate of womenpoor\\nfanny had suffered agonies of sensibilityand he\\nconsidered the existence of each under such a blow\\nwith grateful wonder  roberts offence was unpardonable\\nbut lucys was infinitely worse  neither of them were\\never again to be mentioned to mrs ferrars and even\\nif she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son\\nhis wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter\\nnor be permitted to appear in her presence  the secrecy\\nwith which everything had been carried on between them\\nwas rationally treated as enormously heightening\\nthe crime because had any suspicion of it occurred\\nto the others proper measures would have been taken\\nto prevent the marriage and he called on elinor to join\\nwith him in regretting that lucys engagement with edward\\nhad not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus\\nbe the means of spreading misery farther in the family\\nhe thus continued\\n\\nmrs ferrars has never yet mentioned edwards name\\nwhich does not surprise us but to our great astonishment\\nnot a line has been received from him on the occasion\\nperhaps however he is kept silent by his fear of offending\\nand i shall therefore give him a hint by a line\\nto oxford that his sister and i both think a letter\\nof proper submission from him addressed perhaps to fanny\\nand by her shewn to her mother might not be taken amiss\\nfor we all know the tenderness of mrs ferrarss heart\\nand that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms\\nwith her children\\n\\nthis paragraph was of some importance to the\\nprospects and conduct of edward  it determined him\\nto attempt a reconciliation though not exactly\\nin the manner pointed out by their brother and sister\\n\\na letter of proper submission repeated he\\nwould they have me beg my mothers pardon for roberts\\ningratitude to her and breach of honour to mei can\\nmake no submissioni am grown neither humble nor\\npenitent by what has passedi am grown very happy\\nbut that would not interesti know of no submission\\nthat is proper for me to make\\n\\nyou may certainly ask to be forgiven said elinor\\nbecause you have offendedand i should think you\\nmight now venture so far as to profess some concern\\nfor having ever formed the engagement which drew on you\\nyour mothers anger\\n\\nhe agreed that he might\\n\\nand when she has forgiven you perhaps a little humility\\nmay be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement\\nalmost as imprudent in her eyes as the first\\n\\nhe had nothing to urge against it but still\\nresisted the idea of a letter of proper submission\\nand therefore to make it easier to him as he declared\\na much greater willingness to make mean concessions\\nby word of mouth than on paper it was resolved that\\ninstead of writing to fanny he should go to london\\nand personally intreat her good offices in his favour\\nand if they really do interest themselves said marianne\\nin her new character of candour in bringing about\\na reconciliation i shall think that even john and fanny\\nare not entirely without merit\\n\\nafter a visit on colonel brandons side of only three\\nor four days the two gentlemen quitted barton together\\nthey were to go immediately to delaford that edward\\nmight have some personal knowledge of his future home\\nand assist his patron and friend in deciding on what\\nimprovements were needed to it and from thence\\nafter staying there a couple of nights he was to proceed\\non his journey to town\\n\\n\\n\\nchapter 50\\n\\n\\nafter a proper resistance on the part of mrs ferrars\\njust so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that\\nreproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring\\nthe reproach of being too amiable edward was admitted\\nto her presence and pronounced to be again her son\\n\\nher family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating\\nfor many years of her life she had had two sons\\nbut the crime and annihilation of edward a few weeks ago\\nhad robbed her of one the similar annihilation of robert\\nhad left her for a fortnight without any and now\\nby the resuscitation of edward she had one again\\n\\nin spite of his being allowed once more to live\\nhowever he did not feel the continuance of his existence\\nsecure till he had revealed his present engagement\\nfor the publication of that circumstance he feared\\nmight give a sudden turn to his constitution and carry\\nhim off as rapidly as before  with apprehensive caution\\ntherefore it was revealed and he was listened to with\\nunexpected calmness  mrs ferrars at first reasonably\\nendeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood\\nby every argument in her powertold him that in miss morton\\nhe would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune\\nand enforced the assertion by observing that miss morton\\nwas the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds\\nwhile miss dashwood was only the daughter of a private\\ngentleman with no more than three but when she found that\\nthough perfectly admitting the truth of her representation\\nhe was by no means inclined to be guided by it\\nshe judged it wisest from the experience of the past\\nto submitand therefore after such an ungracious delay\\nas she owed to her own dignity and as served to prevent\\nevery suspicion of goodwill she issued her decree\\nof consent to the marriage of edward and elinor\\n\\nwhat she would engage to do towards augmenting\\ntheir income was next to be considered and here it\\nplainly appeared that though edward was now her only son\\nhe was by no means her eldest for while robert was\\ninevitably endowed with a thousand pounds ayear\\nnot the smallest objection was made against edwards taking\\norders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost\\nnor was anything promised either for the present or in future\\nbeyond the ten thousand pounds which had been given with fanny\\n\\nit was as much however as was desired\\nand more than was expected by edward and elinor\\nand mrs ferrars herself by her shuffling excuses\\nseemed the only person surprised at her not giving more\\n\\nwith an income quite sufficient to their wants\\nthus secured to them they had nothing to wait for\\nafter edward was in possession of the living but the\\nreadiness of the house to which colonel brandon\\nwith an eager desire for the accommodation of elinor\\nwas making considerable improvements and after waiting\\nsome time for their completion after experiencing\\nas usual a thousand disappointments and delays\\nfrom the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen elinor\\nas usual broke through the first positive resolution\\nof not marrying till every thing was ready and the\\nceremony took place in barton church early in the autumn\\n\\nthe first month after their marriage was spent\\nwith their friend at the mansionhouse from whence\\nthey could superintend the progress of the parsonage\\nand direct every thing as they liked on the spot\\ncould chuse papers project shrubberies and invent a sweep\\nmrs jenningss prophecies though rather jumbled together\\nwere chiefly fulfilled for she was able to visit edward\\nand his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas and she\\nfound in elinor and her husband as she really believed\\none of the happiest couples in the world  they had\\nin fact nothing to wish for but the marriage of colonel\\nbrandon and marianne and rather better pasturage for\\ntheir cows\\n\\nthey were visited on their first settling by almost\\nall their relations and friends  mrs ferrars came\\nto inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed\\nof having authorised and even the dashwoods were at\\nthe expense of a journey from sussex to do them honour\\n\\ni will not say that i am disappointed my dear sister\\nsaid john as they were walking together one morning before\\nthe gates of delaford house that would be saying too much\\nfor certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young\\nwomen in the world as it is  but i confess it would\\ngive me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother\\nhis property here his place his house every thing is in\\nsuch respectable and excellent conditionand his woodsi\\nhave not seen such timber any where in dorsetshire as there\\nis now standing in delaford hangerand though perhaps\\nmarianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him\\nyet i think it would altogether be advisable for you to\\nhave them now frequently staying with you for as colonel\\nbrandon seems a great deal at home nobody can tell what\\nmay happenfor when people are much thrown together\\nand see little of anybody elseand it will always be\\nin your power to set her off to advantage and so forth\\nin short you may as well give her a chanceyou understand\\nme\\n\\nbut though mrs ferrars did come to see them and always\\ntreated them with the makebelieve of decent affection\\nthey were never insulted by her real favour and preference\\nthat was due to the folly of robert and the cunning\\nof his wife and it was earned by them before many months\\nhad passed away  the selfish sagacity of the latter\\nwhich had at first drawn robert into the scrape\\nwas the principal instrument of his deliverance from it\\nfor her respectful humility assiduous attentions\\nand endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening\\nwas given for their exercise reconciled mrs ferrars\\nto his choice and reestablished him completely in\\nher favour\\n\\nthe whole of lucys behaviour in the affair\\nand the prosperity which crowned it therefore may be held\\nforth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest\\nan unceasing attention to selfinterest however its progress\\nmay be apparently obstructed will do in securing every\\nadvantage of fortune with no other sacrifice than that of time\\nand conscience  when robert first sought her acquaintance\\nand privately visited her in bartletts buildings\\nit was only with the view imputed to him by his brother\\nhe merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement\\nand as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection\\nof both he naturally expected that one or two interviews\\nwould settle the matter  in that point however\\nand that only he erredfor though lucy soon gave him\\nhopes that his eloquence would convince her in time\\nanother visit another conversation was always wanted\\nto produce this conviction  some doubts always lingered\\nin her mind when they parted which could only be\\nremoved by another half hours discourse with himself\\nhis attendance was by this means secured and the rest\\nfollowed in course  instead of talking of edward\\nthey came gradually to talk only of roberta subject\\non which he had always more to say than on any other\\nand in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal\\nto his own and in short it became speedily evident\\nto both that he had entirely supplanted his brother\\nhe was proud of his conquest proud of tricking edward\\nand very proud of marrying privately without his\\nmothers consent  what immediately followed is known\\nthey passed some months in great happiness at dawlish\\nfor she had many relations and old acquaintances to\\ncutand he drew several plans for magnificent cottages\\nand from thence returning to town procured the forgiveness\\nof mrs ferrars by the simple expedient of asking it\\nwhich at lucys instigation was adopted  the forgiveness\\nat first indeed as was reasonable comprehended only robert\\nand lucy who had owed his mother no duty and therefore\\ncould have transgressed none still remained some weeks\\nlonger unpardoned  but perseverance in humility of conduct\\nand messages in selfcondemnation for roberts offence\\nand gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with\\nprocured her in time the haughty notice which overcame\\nher by its graciousness and led soon afterwards by rapid\\ndegrees to the highest state of affection and influence\\nlucy became as necessary to mrs ferrars as either robert\\nor fanny and while edward was never cordially forgiven\\nfor having once intended to marry her and elinor\\nthough superior to her in fortune and birth was spoken\\nof as an intruder she was in every thing considered\\nand always openly acknowledged to be a favourite child\\nthey settled in town received very liberal assistance\\nfrom mrs ferrars were on the best terms imaginable\\nwith the dashwoods and setting aside the jealousies\\nand illwill continually subsisting between fanny and lucy\\nin which their husbands of course took a part as well\\nas the frequent domestic disagreements between robert and\\nlucy themselves nothing could exceed the harmony in which\\nthey all lived together\\n\\nwhat edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest\\nson might have puzzled many people to find out and what\\nrobert had done to succeed to it might have puzzled them\\nstill more  it was an arrangement however justified in\\nits effects if not in its cause for nothing ever\\nappeared in roberts style of living or of talking to give\\na suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income\\nas either leaving his brother too little or bringing\\nhimself too muchand if edward might be judged from\\nthe ready discharge of his duties in every particular\\nfrom an increasing attachment to his wife and his home\\nand from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits\\nhe might be supposed no less contented with his lot\\nno less free from every wish of an exchange\\n\\nelinors marriage divided her as little from her\\nfamily as could well be contrived without rendering\\nthe cottage at barton entirely useless for her mother\\nand sisters spent much more than half their time with her\\nmrs dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well\\nas pleasure in the frequency of her visits at delaford\\nfor her wish of bringing marianne and colonel brandon together\\nwas hardly less earnest though rather more liberal than\\nwhat john had expressed  it was now her darling object\\nprecious as was the company of her daughter to her\\nshe desired nothing so much as to give up its constant\\nenjoyment to her valued friend and to see marianne settled at\\nthe mansionhouse was equally the wish of edward and elinor\\nthey each felt his sorrows and their own obligations\\nand marianne by general consent was to be the reward\\nof all\\n\\nwith such a confederacy against herwith a knowledge\\nso intimate of his goodnesswith a conviction of his fond\\nattachment to herself which at last though long after it\\nwas observable to everybody elseburst on herwhat could she\\ndo\\n\\nmarianne dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate\\nshe was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions\\nand to counteract by her conduct her most favourite maxims\\nshe was born to overcome an affection formed so late\\nin life as at seventeen and with no sentiment\\nsuperior to strong esteem and lively friendship\\nvoluntarily to give her hand to anotherand that other\\na man who had suffered no less than herself under the\\nevent of a former attachment whom two years before\\nshe had considered too old to be marriedand who still\\nsought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat\\n\\nbut so it was  instead of falling a sacrifice\\nto an irresistible passion as once she had fondly\\nflattered herself with expectinginstead of remaining\\neven for ever with her mother and finding her only\\npleasures in retirement and study as afterwards in her\\nmore calm and sober
